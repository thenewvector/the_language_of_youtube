        "transcript": " I can't believe I'm actually gonna tell you this. I've never told anybody this, but it's important. So when I was 22 years old, I had an affair with a married woman. She had two kids, and it is one of the things that I am the most ashamed of myself for doing. I think about not only like what an asshole I was for doing it, how stupid, how stupid it was, and the fact that I'm better than that, right? Apparently I'm not. I like to think that I'm better than that, or I am now. I'm better than that now. And so that's why I want to tell you some more things that I've learned the hard way. And I'm the type of guy that learns everything the hard way, all right? How do you know not to get a DUI? I got a DUI. Like, I'm the idiot that needs to go through things, but hopefully you're smarter than me. Today, guys, I'm gonna go over a few types of women that you should never sleep with. So number one is anybody who's married. It doesn't matter how hot she is. It doesn't matter how bad it is at home and you're different. And I can talk to you, right? There's always a story. Stop flirting with married women, period. All right? Don't do it. Because you never know where it's going to lead. Honestly, actually, I do know where it's gonna lead. Nowhere good. You don't want any part of her. You don't want any part of it. And even if she leaves him, you don't want her in the future because honestly, she's gonna cheat on you. Guys, do not be that guy. Do not be that person. Do not be that outlet for her. If she wants to leave him, fine. If she wants to get with you, then okay. But while she's with them, absolutely not. Number two, a woman with children. All right, now. You're like, wait a second, Al, but that's kind of a dick move to say that. Well, here's the deal. I'm a firm believer that unless you are willing and ready to commit to being a father and a parent, you shouldn't be messing around with a woman who's got children because even if you date for a while, you're gonna get to know her kids. They're gonna get to know you. It's not just about you and your weiner. It's about those children. And red flag, like huge, like waving, flashing red flag. If she introduces you to her kids early on, like game over, like do not pass, go, stop. Number three is a coworker, period. All right, now. You're like, but Alpho, she's hot. I get it. It doesn't matter. If you are dating a coworker or you're sleeping with somebody, you gotta think it through. Don't do it. Just don't do it. Even though she's hot, even though you're like, oh, we're flirting so hard and we go to lunch and I went on a business trip and we kind of got to stop. Just stop. Don't lie to yourself. Don't think that this is gonna work out. It's not gonna work out. And if it goes bad, oh mama, then you are possibly gonna be in trouble or fired or have to find a new job. Because if she gets pissed off because you don't wanna date her full time or you dick her over or she sees you with another spicy San Rita like Brenda in accounting, right? She's gonna be like, oh my God, he was an appropriator. He did whatever. Gentlemen, you can't take the risk. Do not shit where you eat. Next thing you should not get freaky with is your ex. How do I know? Once again, I learn everything the hard way. Breakups are hard enough, right? Having and going back for seconds or like, oh, we can do this casually. If there was like serious like feelings and somebody got hurt or you got hurt or she got hurt, don't think you're gonna change her mind. Don't think all of a sudden she's gonna be like, oh yeah, this is cool. It's just casual. No, she's gonna get all crazy. You're gonna get all possibly upset and crazy when she doesn't want you back. Like whatever, it's a horrible situation. You broke up for a reason. It's time to find somebody to know. I know you're comfortable with her. I know she's like, it's okay. It's not okay. Don't do it. Thank me later. Next up is a five or a four or a three depending on how drunk you get it can go down to a two. Somebody who's not up to your standards, right? Don't just be like, yo, whatever, because once again, the potential ramification of you sticking your wiener in somewhere you shouldn't be sticking it is potentially humongous, right? And she could be humongous. And if that's your thing, hey, I'm not hating. I'm just saying you gotta be careful. You gotta not lower your standards just to get a piece of ass, even if that ass is a little large. I know that she's looking good because you've been drinking but don't do it. You never know when you're gonna catch something. You never know when you're possibly gonna get somebody pregnant, which brings me to somebody else you shouldn't sleep with. And that is anybody unprotected, all right? Unless you're in like a serious, like long-term relationship, you gotta understand. They say that it's like you're sleeping with every past partner that that partner slept with and their partners. And so it's this big, huge, monstrous, like spider web that like means that you've slept with like 6,000 people, right? Well, here's the deal. I don't necessarily know that I believe that, but I do believe that STDs are not something that you want, regardless of if it's something that you can cure with a shampoo or it's something that's gonna last for like ever or it's something that will literally kill you. You don't want one, all right? Young people are the fastest growing population of people with STDs. Why? Because your asses are sluts and you're promiscuous. Wrap that rascal. You also don't wanna get somebody pregnant that you don't wanna get pregnant, all right? Because if you do, guess what? Game over, I should say, game drastically like altered. You're gonna have to figure something else out because you gotta take care of that kid and not be a huge piece of shit. It's not her problem, it's your problem. Together, the next person you shouldn't get sexy with is anybody who's like dirty, like poor hygiene, just like kinda gross. Does she have funky breath? Does she have bad body odor? Does she not look like clean? She's not gonna be clean. And she's gonna smell funky, which brings me to something else. You need to smell fresh, which brings me to something else. I need your opinion. Do you like this new ad? Hey. Come on in. Wow, it smells amazing in here. What is it? Is it these? It's not those. I baked your cookies, is it these? No, it's better than that. I'm wearing my new cologne, is it this? No, it's even better. Oh my God, it's your balls. Pete and Pedro's ball powder will keep you fresh, dry, and smelling amazing all day long. Head over to PeteandPedro.com. Gentlemen, when your balls smell this fresh, nothing else matters. What do you guys think? Do you dig it? Do you like it? Is it good? It's a new ad that I put together for the Pete and Pedro ball powder. And we're gonna run it. We're gonna try it as pre-roll. And I just wanted to basically see if I could create a fun video that is a little bit outlandish, a little bit crazy, and definitely fun. If you guys dug it or didn't dig it, down below I wanna know. Say yo, Alpha, this is what I thought of it. Is it clever? Is it good? And do you think it'll sell ball powder? Or do you think it'll sell zero? Speaking of selling, if you wanna grab yours, I've got a special link and discount code down below for your help. And honestly, I just want your balls to smell good. The next person you should never, ever, under any circumstance to sleep with, is somebody that's got huge emotional issues. Because here's the deal. Nothing makes emotional issues get worse like having sex with somebody. And if she's somebody that is a basket case or has a lot of issues or she's an addict, or crazy, is she crazy? Is she emotional? Hold on, I'm gonna say that's every woman. I'm kidding, all right? But you get what I'm saying. If she's not like super balanced or emotionally healthy, you don't wanna be getting sexy with her because it's gonna become your problem. You hit it real well and she's like, oh my God, that was amazing. And now she's gonna be laying under your back tire when you're backing out in the morning. Like you never know. She's gonna hack into your account. She's gonna be all crazy, which brings me to somebody else you shouldn't sleep with. And you're probably not gonna know this until after you do. But it's somebody who is jealous. There's nothing worse than being with a jealous person. And if you get sexy with somebody, even if you guys know like, hey, this is a casual thing, we're just doing this, right? If she's a jealous person or you've known her for a while and she's been jealous with somebody else, don't do it, I'm telling you. Don't even stick it there. I'm promising you, it's gonna end poorly. Someone else that will is sleeping with your buddy's ex-girlfriend or wife. The next person you should not get sexy or frisky with. Even though you think she's hot, even though she thinks you're hot, and even though she wants to really piss off her ex-boyfriend, don't do it. Guys, there's an ancient Chinese proverb that goes something like, brose before hose, something like that. There's a reason for that, right? Don't do it. Don't even, I don't care how hot she is. I don't care that you've been always dying to, don't do it. Next up is anybody who's too drunk. Oh yeah. I've got other stories, not because of me, because I know somebody, but there's a woman that this dude got sexy with, she woke up and she's like, yo, I got a boyfriend, and yo, you did this and I didn't want to. I'm not saying, actually I am saying, you gotta make sure that everybody is on the same page. And last, but certainly not least, any woman if you're in a relationship, period. Don't be a scumbag, don't be a cheater. The fact is, I know that things happen, but I'm a firm believer that if you don't put yourself in these situations or open yourself up to it, you can prevent them, all right? If you don't want to cheat on your girlfriend, don't go to bars with your boys and get drunk, all right? Period. Don't be a scumbag. Don't flirt with people that flirt with you if you're not single. I know it feels good. I know that you're looking all good and sexy because you watch my videos and you've dropped them one of these, but it doesn't matter. Gentlemen, if you're not happy, get out of the relationship and then go crazy. But until you do, don't do it. She deserves better and so do you."

        "transcript": " There are certain things that you can totally go cheap on, like white t-shirts. White t-shirts, you know that they're gonna get stained, whether or not they're cheap or they're expensive, they're gonna get pit stains. They're gonna wear out, they're gonna get stretched out, you're gonna have to toss them in about a year. But on the flip side, there are other things that a man should never cheap out on. Today guys, I'm gonna go over my list of things that you should never go cheap. So number one is running shoes. Or any shoes if you are an athlete, all right? The fact is, the cheap shoes, typically they're gonna be cheap. They're not gonna be built as well. If you go on to Amazon, you search for like running shoes, even if you look for like Brooks running shoes, you're gonna see some that are like $40, you're gonna see some that are like $120. The truth is they are built differently. In my opinion, your feet, they're super important. And if you're a runner or you're an athlete, it's critical that you upgrade and invest in quality footwear. Which brings us to number two, and that is leather shoes or boots. Guys, when it comes to footwear, stylish footwear, you gotta upgrade the shoes. I personally feel like you should reach for the highest level of quality you can afford. It doesn't mean to buy $1,000 loafers if you're making $40,000 a year, but invest in the highest quality you can afford. The higher quality leather shoes and boots are gonna last longer, they're gonna look better, and basically they're going to give you a lot more value and bang for your buck. Number three is underwear. If you've ever worn high quality, nice underwear, all right? It's like next level. It feels better, it fits better, you'll look sexier. Gentlemen, I'm telling you, all right? It makes a difference. I personally feel like a dude shouldn't skimp or go cheap on underwear, all right? Something else is suits, all right? So now this one is a little bit tricky because if you go like too high end, it doesn't mean you're getting like a superior product. In my opinion, suit supply makes the best suit for the money in terms of quality, in terms of styling. But in my opinion, if you're wearing a cheap suit and you're gonna buy at a Joseph A. Banks or a Macy's or any of these other stores, unfortunately, it's not gonna look good, it's not gonna fit good, and the quality is actually crap. And when I say cheap, you know, I'm not even saying that it's gonna be like super inexpensive, right? It makes a huge difference when you actually buy a suit that is like canvas or half canvas. It doesn't have like structured shoulders. It's got a more natural stance, gentlemen, I'm telling you. It's gonna look better, it's gonna last longer, and you are gonna love it more. Don't go cheap with the suits in terms of quality. Denim. You can actually go cheap with denim. That's my personal opinion. Now, some dudes will be like, no, you gotta go like premium and high end. I've worn premium expensive jeans. I've worn cheap jeans, and in my opinion, cheap jeans are just as good. They fit fine, they look good, and in my opinion, they actually will last a little bit longer. Because one of the problems with some of the higher end denim is that there's a lot of stretch in it. The more stretch, the more prone it is to wearing out. The cheaper jeans that are 100% cotton last longer even if they're less money. Watches, you can go cheap with them. There are so many amazingly bad ass brands that are like literally super affordable, that are going to look amazing, and honestly, like Casio's, not to mention Timex's, they are super bad ass, even if they're cheap. Next thing is bedding. The fact is guys, bedding is in my opinion, something you should never cheap out on. Whether or not it's the mattress, or the pillowcases, or the sheets, or the duvet, or the comforter, it makes a difference. You're gonna sleep better, you're gonna sleep more deeply, and not to mention you're not gonna be all jacked up and have some whack like muscle spasm. If you're still rocking a futon, it's time for you to upgrade. Skincare, don't go cheap. There is a huge difference in the cheap stuff and the more premium skincare. Now, once again, I'm not talking about cheap in terms of the price. A lot of times it is correlated, but not all the time. T-Janly is super premium, but it is also crazy high quality. But the fact is, when you invest in skincare, it makes a huge difference. Because if you're going cheap, typically the ingredients are gonna be cheap, they're not gonna be as effective as the higher and more premium products. Next thing is hair products. Number one, never go cheap with your hair products. You wanna upgrade to something that's higher quality. It's not gonna have all the damaging toxins, the parrots, the soul fights, not to mention all the alcohol guys. When you invest a little more money into a higher quality hair product, it makes a difference. Your hair's gonna look better, the products are gonna perform better, and you're gonna be happier. You're also not gonna damage your hair. It's critical that you upgrade the grooming products that you're using. And the deodorant is one of the, if not, the number one product that is wreaking havoc on your body. If you're using a standard like any pursuant deodorant that's super cheap that you're buying in the drug store, it's bad for your body. It goes in, it clogs the sweat ducts, it doesn't allow you to actually sweat. All the toxins build up in your lymph system, gentlemen. All sorts of bad things not to mention. It reduces your testosterone level. Guys, if you wanna check out the P-tin-veg-ger deodorant, it is natural, it is amazing. It is eucalyptus spearmint, it is so sexy, and it is the best natural deodorant on the market. Not only does it smell incredible, it works like crazy. Guys, I'm gonna link to all the P-tin-veg-ger stuff that I mentioned down below. I'm also gonna give you a limited time discount because I want you to look amazing. And I also wanna make it a little cheaper. Next up is fitness equipment. More specifically, treadmills, ellipticals, exercise bikes, all the stuff that is built for commercial use, much higher quality. The stuff that you're gonna find at like a Walmart, a Target, a Dick's Sporting Goods store, super cheap, super low quality, and honestly, it breaks. When you invest a little more money in something that's higher quality, it's gonna last you longer, it's gonna be more sturdy, and that's gonna increase the chance of you actually using it. All right, also, fitness memberships. I personally feel like if you have a choice between a cheap gym and one that's a little bit more expensive but offers a better experience, you feel better going there, they're sassier people that you may wanna look at, there's better exercise equipment, it's just a better vibe. I personally would recommend spending a little extra money on a higher quality gym membership. Because once again, if it's something that you enjoy going to do, you're gonna do it more. Cats? Never, I'm kidding, always go cheap with any animal, go cheap, all right, I know the designer dogs, the pucadoodles, and all that nonsense, I know it's trendy, I know that everybody has them, but in my opinion, go to the pound, go someplace that's doing an adoption, there are a lot of amazing pets out there that basically are incredible, they're gonna love you like crazy, and they're not a pure bread or something like super posh and expensive, but the fact is they're amazing, and they need you, all right, don't be a dick, don't buy an expensive dog, in my opinion, I think that's one of the most ridiculous things ever, financing a dog, are you kidding me, all right, something else I wanna talk about is health insurance. Now, here's the deal, a lot of young dudes do not buy or invest in health insurance, and the reason is cause they're like, yo, I'm okay, I'm gonna be fine forever, in my opinion, you should invest in good insurance, whether or not it's for your car, whether or not it's for yourself, whether or not it's for your house, your apartment, whatever, you know, insurance is one of those things that it's not sexy, right, it's not like sexy money, when it comes to like a car, it's kinda like buying tires, it's not like a sexy, you know, way to spend money, but if you ever need it, you're gonna be glad that you did, and you know, I think with some of the events that you're seeing more and more now, in terms of like home insurance, stuff like that, I think it's worth it, it's definitely worth it, I know that you think you're gonna live forever, and you're always gonna be healthy, but if you're not, just saying, you're gonna be glad you didn't cheap out on it. Glasses, sunglasses, eyewear, definitely you can cheap out on that, like seriously, there are a lot of places like glassesUSA.com, a lot of sunglasses brands that aren't gonna like break the bank, all right, all the Tom Ford, all those like expensive brands, one of the biggest ripoffs out there is eyewear, all right, I used to have a sunglasses company, Enemy, and I know what this stuff cost in order to make it, and it's insane, all right, you could absolutely cheap out on not really sacrifice quality or experience, and there are a lot of bad ass eyewear brands out there that look amazing that aren't gonna break the bank. Something else I wanna talk about real quick is actually food, all right, so here's the deal, I was not always a firm believer that you should invest in higher quality food, right, in terms of like organic or stuff like that, but the more I read, the more I research, the more I learn, the more I taste, the more I understand that it is very important if you are consuming something to make sure that it is higher quality. I'm not saying to always buy everything organic, but when it comes to like your meats, your beefs, your proteins, I personally feel like it is definitely worth the money, but what did I miss? Guys, down below, I wanna know what's something that you feel you should never go cheap on, down below, let me know, and if you dug this video on more like this, drop me one of these, don't cheap out on that."

        "transcript": " So when you're a young dude, you can get away with making certain style mistakes. In your teens, right, nobody expects much from you. You're still figuring things out. You're still learning about style, about fit, about fabric. But as you start to age and mature, in your 20s, 30s, 40s, it's critical that you stop doing some of the things that you did when you were younger. Today, guys, I'm going to go over some teen style mistakes that you as an adult man must avoid. Number one is what I call a teen dress up. Teeners are slacks, button up shirt, and it's high. And that's it. That's what every young dude does when it's time to dress up. You got to do better. When you start to mature and evolve, you've got to add that third piece, that layer. All right? Whether or not it's a v-neck sweater, a cardigan, or a sport coat, you've got to add that third piece to finish the look. Brings me to the next mistake, and that is not investing in your outerwear. So I just want to show you my outfit that I'm actually wearing, all right? So this outfit that I got on, right here. I'm wearing some black sneakers, black pants, ants and belt, and then a cream shirt, right? Now, what most young dudes would do in terms of this outfit if they wanted to wear a jacket is just wear a casual jacket, right? They'd wear something like this, all right? And the problem with wearing just any old jacket is that once again, it doesn't match. It doesn't finish the look, all right? You've got a casual jacket with a little bit dressier of a look. It's not stylish. Instead, what you should opt for is some type of elevated driving jacket or a P-coat or some type of dress jacket. Guys, when you start to evolve and mature as a man, you've got to pay more attention to your outerwear. Not just that casual jacket that's warm. You've got to do better. You've got to buy stylish options. Like I said, a driving jacket, a P-coat is a much better option and something that every adult dude should invest in. Which brings me to number three, how you carry your crap and what you carry it in. Whether or not that's a wallet or some type of backpack or bag, you've got to upgrade and elevate what you're carrying because this once again is an accessory. And if your style looks great and you're carrying like a backpack that's like built for a little boy or some worn out bag, it just doesn't finish the look. You've got to upgrade all of the aesthetic. The next mistake is wearing a baseball hat way too much, all right? If you're going to wear one once in a while, that's cool. But all the time is overkill and it also doesn't look good. Young dudes do it because they don't have to fix their hair and they also probably have a crap hairstyle. But as you mature, as you age, you've got to throw the baseball caps out. Next up is denim, all right? A few things we've got to talk about. Number one is distressing. If you're wearing jeans that are ripped or torn, stop it. It's not a good look. It's also something that young dudes do. If the jeans are too tight, stop it. You're too old for that. If they're too big and baggy, stop it. If they're hanging off your ass, stop it. No self-respecting grown-up is dressing with pants hanging off of their ass, which brings me to the next thing we've got to talk about, and that is your belt, all right? Stop wearing beat-up belts, all right? If your belt has a bunch of holes and it's all nicked and gnarled, stop it. Like do better than that. The next thing we've got to talk about in belts is big belt buckles. Don't do it. It's not stylish. It's also not a good look, all right? Something else with belts is not matching your leather. So here's the deal, guys. When it comes to dressing up, if you're wearing dress shoes, your belt needs to match not only in finish but also in texture. What I mean by this, if you're wearing shiny black dress shoes and your belt is like a matte black, this doesn't work. You got to make sure you're wearing a shiny dress belt that actually matches the shoes. All right, now, black is easier than brown. With brown, it's a little bit more challenging because there's so many different shades of brown, but that's one of the other reasons why I love ants and belts so much. Dude, they have a massive selection of different colored brown leathers, all right? They also have casual, they've got dress belts, and this one that I'm wearing is one of my favorites. It's a murdered out ants and belt, all right? Ants and belts, I'm going to link to them down below, guys. There's a special link down below. If you go through there, you can actually build a box set for under $100. For literally under $100, you get six different belt combinations because you get to pick three straps and two buckles, and that's the thing. They're interchangeable, all right? Check this out. Look how sexy and badass that belt is. Now you're like, wait a second, I don't see any holes. Alpha, what's going on? Well, here's the deal. That's the magic behind ants and belts. It doesn't have a bunch of holes to get all beat up in like weird looking, right? It's the track system. Check it out. Look at that. It is a track system that is built into the belt, all right? All you do, ready, ready, ready, wait for it, boom. Click it into place. There's a little trigger underneath to release it just like that. And like I said, they're interchangeable. Check this out, right? The buckle, boom. All you got to do is grab another buckle, slip it on, right, and lock it into place. And you are good to go. Check it out, right? How badass is that? Guys, I'm telling you, if you haven't grabbed an ants and belt yet, you are totally missing out on one of the greatest accessories out there. And the thing that I love, they have a crazy selection. They've got leather belts. They've also got canvas belts. Check it out, right? Look at these canvas ants and they are amazing. You've got a bunch of fun, funky colors. All right, to coordinate with your outfit, you've got camo, you've got black, you've got blue, you've got stripe, you've got gray. And the other really cool thing about ants and belts is that they come one size fits all. All right, all you do when you get your belt is put it around you, thread it through your belt loops, get some scissors, cut it, and attach your buckle, and you are ready to rock in style. Gentlemen, hit the link down below. Build a box set for under $100. Pick three straps, two buckles. The buckles, they also have a crazy selection. You could go silver, you could go gold, you could go black. You can go shiny. You could go silver, brushed. You can go gunmetal. Gentlemen, the options are literally endless and you are going to look amazing. Guys, I'm telling you, if you don't have an ants and now is the time, hit the link down below and build a box set for under $100. The next mistake is black dress shoes. Like always wearing black dress shoes. The deal is guys, black is a great color. I love it. The whole monochromatic look amazing. Chef's kiss sexy, but in my opinion, brown is a much better dress shoe color. Brown in my opinion is a much superior style color in terms of dress shoes than black. Guys that wear brown shoes, I feel are a cut above, a little bit more stylish than guys that are just plain, it's safe, and easy with black. And the other beautiful thing is that brown in my opinion looks better with gray. It looks better with navy blue. It looks better with tan. It looks better with earth tones. It looks better with green. Like literally, brown is a better color. Plus, bonus, all your buddies aren't wearing brown, right? Because they're still safe and stuck and looking like teens wearing black. Which brings me to the next mistake and that is dressing exactly the same as all of your friends, all of your peers. Unfortunately, this is an epidemic. If you look at young dudes, right, they all look the same. They look like little clones of each other. And unfortunately, if you go into an office setting, same thing happens with dudes. I call business casual boring because that's what it is. Everybody looks the same. Nobody is willing to step outside of the box. The other problem is that a lot of these dudes have their girls or their wives buying their clothes, which is a recipe for style disaster. Which is the next mistake? And that is letting a woman pick out your clothes, all right? When you're a teen, grandma probably buys you some stuff. Your mom, she's like, oh, wear these khaki pants, Billy. They're awesome. And you're like, okay, because you're young and you can't basically buy your own pants. Gentlemen, stop letting your woman dress you. She has zero clue about what's going to work for you. She's so worried about herself, making sure she's sassy and looking sexy, you've got to worry about you. If you're letting your woman shop for you, shame on you. Like literally, you look like handed out. Your man card, your style man card, I want it back. I also want it back if I can see your undershirt, which is the next mistake. Guys, visible undershirts are horrible. Personally, I don't like undershirts because they throw off the aesthetic of your outfit. They also bind with your shirt. It doesn't allow your outerwear to drape properly. It looks terrible. It also makes you look fatter. Gentlemen, but if you can see it, this is an unforgivable style sin, in my opinion. If you got to wear one because you're a sweaty mess or your nipples are huge, like whatever, I'm not judging. I'm just saying, wear a v-neck. They make undershirts that have like super deep Vs, but there's a problem with v-necks. Because if you're going to unbutton your shirt, three buttons like I would recommend, then you're going to be able to see the v-neck unless it's like super deep. That's going to be weird. Gentlemen, three buttons. Unbutton. In my opinion, this is the magic number. One button makes you look like a math teacher. Two buttons makes you look like your dad or your weird uncle Barry. Three buttons makes you look sexy. Over-laundering your clothing. The next mistake. Here's the deal. Young dudes are not the best when it comes to laundry. Hey, they probably don't do it. Their mom still does it. And they overdo it. Every time they wear something, even if it's not dirty, boom, into the hamper it goes. No, gentlemen, stop doing it. When you overlaunder your clothing, it's going to basically break it down faster. It's going to look older quicker and it's going to shrink. And typically what's going to happen is it's not going to look as good as long as it could if you would basically just offer an exercise, a little bit of restraint. If it doesn't smell, if it's not like dirty, it doesn't need to be washed. Bank leather. Don't even think about it. Like don't even think. Like if you were to think, stop. Don't think about it. Don't do it. It looks cheap and you look cheap, right? Fake leather shoes, cheap. Fake wallet that's supposed to be leather. You look cheap. Gentlemen, don't do it. Fake leather jacket? Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Stop it. Stop it. If you don't want to wear leather, then don't wear leather. But don't wear fake leather. Like period. And the last thing I just want to mention is higher quality. All right? Invest in fewer pieces, higher quality. This goes for everything that you buy. Whether or not it's a watch, all right? Shoes, jeans, sweaters, outerwear. One of the mistakes that a lot of young dudes make is they think, hey, I need to buy like a lot of stuff so you buy cheap stuff. Well, the problem with this is that it doesn't last. It looks bad. Instead, what I'd recommend as you start to mature in age, you're buying things that are going to last you like a lifetime or a long time, all right? You need to look at things more as a per wear cost and an investment as opposed to just something that you're going to buy and then not wear in three months, six months or throw out. You can't buy stuff like H&M or Zara. It's going to wear out really quick. It's super cheap clothing. And the truth is that the price isn't like that low compared to what you could buy, a higher quality item. And one of the things that separates adult style from young style is investing in higher quality garments. It's going to feel better. It's going to look better. And it's going to last longer. Gentlemen, bottom line is this. Stop dressing like a teenager."

        "transcript": " So there's nothing wrong with getting older and aging. It's part of life. But there is something wrong with trying to look too young when you start to mature. It makes you look awkward and it also makes you look like you're trying too hard. Today guys, I'm going over some things that older guys do to look young that actually makes you look worse. Number one is a toupee or a hair piece. Even a good hair piece in my opinion is a bad hair piece because you're always self-conscious about it. You're always trying to fix it, right? You're always worried about it. Don't do it, gentlemen. If you're losing your hair, go to Bosley or take something like finasteride or propitia in order to keep the hair that you have and take it short and you'll be fine. Grow some facial hair, you'll look like a badass. Number two is a hair transplant that's bad. All right, so here's the deal. All hair transplants were not created equal. In the old days, they were super obvious. Now, if you go to a place that's going to give you an unnatural hairline, it's also obvious and in my opinion makes you look worse. Number three is overly dyed hair on your head but also your facial hair. Nothing makes a dude look more obvious like he's trying to look like super young than when he's got like jet black hair or a jet black beard when he's literally like 65. But if you're like, yo, Alfa, I don't care. I don't want to look mature. I want to look sexy, young and youthful. I want to cover my gray. Well, I'd recommend covering some of it. There are a lot of great products out there now that will basically take some of the gray out while leaving some of it. It really comes down to you having a little bit of restraint and making sure you don't cover it and make it jet black. The next thing that old dudes do to look younger but it actually makes you look awkward is veneers. All right, so am I the only one that thinks veneers look a little ridiculous? Now a white smile, of course, is gonna make you look young, youthful and sexy but having perfect big like chicklet teeth in my opinion just makes you look like silly. It just looks like ridiculous and old. It's too obvious, too big, too bulky, too. Like just like weird in my opinion. A better option is just whiten your teeth. Combine over the counter the crest strips. I absolutely love. You wear them for about 20 minutes. Boom, take them off your teeth. They're whiter or the bleaching trace or you can go in for like zoom whitening. So it doesn't make you look weird that I'm seeing more and more dudes doing to look young is facial plastic surgery and injections whether or not it's Botox, it's Restylane, it's fillers. It's ridiculous. Age gracefully, all right? But if your face is like frozen or it's like too like shiny and just weird because you've had all the fillers and Botox in my opinion, it makes you look insecure. It also just doesn't make you look good. Instead, you know what to do. T-shanly, skincare routine, start young. If you do, if you start doing the basic things you need to do when you're young, you're not gonna have anything to worry about as you age. For me, I'm like almost 50 years old and I think I look pretty young for my age and the reason is because I have good skin. I also have good hair and I basically take care of my body which we'll talk about in a second. But the bottom line is take care of your skin. A basic skincare routine is something that every single one of you should start. The earlier you start, the better. If you use T-shanly, amazing. If you use some other lower quality, higher priced product, I don't even care. Just start taking care of your skin. A few basic things you need to do every day. Wash your base twice a day, exfoliate twice a week, and then moisturize morning and night and that's it. And those are the four products that come in a T-shanly level one system. The basic fundamental products that every single one of you needs. But you could also kick it up to the next level. If you're a little bit older, level two comes with an eye cream. Level three is the one that I use. It comes with your core products, eye cream, but also an anti-aging serum. Now you want to take it next level? Go with our retinol stick. Retinol is an amazingly powerful anti-aging tool that you can use. You basically just swipe it on your face before you put on your PM moisturizer in the night. It's going to help even your skin tone. It's going to fight free radical damage. It's going to fight crow's feet and it's just going to make you look amazing. Guys, I'm going to link down below to a special T-shanly link. All right, if you go through my link, I'm going to do something special for you for the new year. 40% off your first month, but you're also going to get a free gift. All right, the free gift right here is a manicure kit. It's a $30 value, right? Super badass. You're getting this bad boy for free. Plus 40% off your first month. Guys, do not wait. Guys, hit the link down below. Do not wait. This is for a limited time and while supplies last. So if you're interested, go grab whichever system you want. 40% off month number one. You're also going to get a super badass free gift. The next thing that makes you look weird and awkward as an older dude is trying to dress too young. Oh my God, this one drives me crazy, right? Here's the deal. There are a few things we've got to talk about. If you're wearing like super young, trendy brands, it makes you look awkward and old. If you're shopping in stores that are way too young for you, also awkward and old. Another one is wearing clothes that are too tight. All right, skinny jeans look bad on pretty much anybody, but they look even worse on dudes that are over the age of like 45. All right, some other things. If you're wearing skin tight shirts to the gym, you look like a douche. You also look once again, like you're trying too hard. The deal is gentlemen, you got to take care of your body, but you got to also wear clothing that fits your body. Don't wear clothing that's too trendy. Don't wear clothing that's too young. Don't wear overly ostentatious shit because it makes you look stupid, which brings me to the next thing that makes you look weird. All right, here's the deal. This one, this one's probably going to make you go, wait, what? But the deal is if you go to the gym and you see an older gentleman and he's just like, jacked. Now, I'm not talking about like good shape or like relatively, I'm talking about like jacked. Obviously on a very strong supplement plan, all right? Little TRT, little something more than a TRT. It's actually not therapy, it's abuse at that point. But these dudes are just looking like kind of stupid in my opinion, because of how big and how massive they are. There's a fine line between being in good shape for your age and looking stupid and just like, I don't know. I'm not feeling the whole like giant, jacked, ripped, shredded stud when you're literally in your 50s or 60s. I mean, if that's your thing, that's your thing, but I personally think it's a little bit weird. Something else that's weird is when you use too much young person slang, right? If you're a dude and you're over the age of like 40 and you're saying dope, you look like a dope. Being a party animal, all right? This one also is another one of those like, poor thing. If you're an older dude, right? You wanna go out, you wanna have a drink, you wanna go out, you wanna socialize, that's fine. But if you're hitting the club and you're all like being like, yeah, like let's go, like come on, like let's go home and go to bed, all right? The next thing that makes you look kind of old, and this one once again is gonna be like, dude, alpha, don't hate on them, is dating women that are way too young for you. All right, this once again, for me, is a little bit of an ick, all right? I am fine with you looking good. I am fine with you dating attractive women, but when it goes to like young, like young girl, then it's definitely like a little bit weird. I'm not mad at you for having money or being like awesome, right? And being a little bit older, that's fine. Women do find older, awesome, you know, successful men like attractive, but when you're dating like a 20 year old and you're 52, this in my opinion, makes you look a little creepy. Speaking of creepy, too many accessories, right? Think of Johnny Depp, all right? If you see Johnny Depp like years ago when he was like younger, he was wearing a bunch of accessories, right? He's got the earrings, he's got the necklaces, he's got bracelets and all that good stuff. And back then when he was younger, it was like, all right, cool, Johnny, you're a little like cool, Johnny. Right now, he's still doing it and he's like in his 60s and it just looks weird. Something else that looks weird when you're a little bit older is wearing trendy bags or carrying trendy bags, right? Cross body bags, those like little bags with like the string backpacks, like they just look stupid, gentlemen. Pretty much any like ultra trendy thing, whether or not it's shoes, it's pants, it's jackets, you look a little bit weird or I should say awkward or better yet, douchey. And the last thing that makes you look like not good as you age is too much cologne, all right? Something that I've noticed is that it seems like some dudes, like as they get older, they increase the amount of pumps or sprays that they're rocking. They're like, yo, smell me, I'm sexy. And I'm like, yo, get away from me, you're repulsive."

        "transcript": " So the number one thing I'm working on personally this year is my body. I've let it get out of hand. All right. Not that I'm like sloppy fat, but I don't look the way that I like to look. My body fat has gotten too high and the summer's coming up. It's going to be here before we know it. And so today I thought I'd actually take you shopping with me. I'm going to Whole Foods to buy the food that I need. And this is the food that I'm going to be sharing with you that I eat for breakfast, for lunch, but also for dinner. It's fat burning foods that you should be eating. All right. So before I actually show you my meals, I've got to talk about my workout plan. All right. So here's how I'm going to do it. I can't, I can't. Ah, shit. Okay. So I just got told I can't film. So I'm going to shop, go back to my office, show you what I got. Yeah. The one closest to you. All right, gentlemen. Now let's talk about my meal plan and the foods that I'm eating to shred body fat. So meal number one, my breakfast, I'm going to share with you the two different options that I have and the foods that go into them, because all the foods are super amazing in terms of protein packed, calorie and fat shredding options. All right. So the first option is one that you may have seen before. It's called the Alpha Oats. All right. It is half a cup of oatmeal, which is going to be about 150 calories. It's high in fiber, which is going to be good. It's slow digesting, slow burning, which means it's not going to spike your insulin. When it comes to carbohydrates, that is the name of the game. It's not about totally avoiding carbs, your body, your brain needs them, but the bottom line is that if it can be more slow digesting, your insulin level isn't going to spike. When your insulin level spikes, that's when you typically are going to store body fat, and so keep it low, keep it awesome. I'll have half a scoop of whole oats and then after it cooks, I will add one scoop of chocolate protein. Calories around 110 protein is going to be around like 22 grams. Typically I'm going to add like a scoop and a half to get about 30, 35 grams of protein. And then I will also have a piece of fruit. All right. Whether or not it's a green apple or a grapefruit, once again, high in fiber, awesome, tastes good. And it just gives me a little something extra. Another option, if you guys aren't interested in doing something like a protein powder is some type of low fat cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is also another amazing source of protein. For me, I have like this weird thing with dairy and so I can't eat it, but I love it so much. But cottage cheese is also amazing. Like this little container basically contains around the amount of protein in the total container basically contains around like 300 calories. And in the total container, it's got around 60 grams of protein, which is huge. So eating like half of this would be amazing. I also will do about a little handful. I would say, I don't know, about an ounce of almonds. I like eating fat in the morning. All right. I eat fat at pretty much any every meal. And the reason is because fat is essential. If you try to do like zero fat or low fat, this is actually going to prevent you from losing body fat. You can eat yourself the good fat, the omega three, six, nine. And you actually consume the good fat. Your body's like, yo, I can release some of this bad fat. All right. Because I don't need it. That is just simply stored energy. Your body's hanging on to it just in case, you know, you faster you don't have Uber eats or whatever it is. Meal number two, I call alpha eggs. You can imagine it's probably going to be eggs and you would be right. All right. So here's the deal. I will eat eggs. What I do typically is six eggs. I'll eat two yolks and six whites. All right. Amazing. Eggs are the most perfect food out there for building muscle, burning body fat. All right. It is like complete protein and it is incredible. And then I will also have half of an avocado with my eggs. And the reason, once again, it's about getting the good fat, the healthy fat. We'll also eat that piece of fruit with that breakfast option. But both of those breakfasts are packed with amazing foods that are going to help me shred body fat, pack on lean muscle, and feel incredible throughout the day. So I eat breakfast, typically it's around 10, 30, 11, and then three hours later around one or two o'clock, I'll eat my lunch. All right. Typically I'm going to be here working. And so what I do because it's easy, it's delicious, and it's also super healthy is factor factor. Right. I've talked about it a gazillion times. Look at the slogan. Fitness starts with food. All right. The meal plan that I'm on basically is the calorie smart plan. Every meal that I get from factor is 550 calories or below, but they've got a few others, which I'll tell you about in a second. But the reason why I love factor so much is because it allows me to stay on my plan, but still eat and enjoy delicious meals. Guys, if you have not checked out factor now is the time. So the way that it works is pretty awesome. You go to that link down below and then you choose what type of meal plan you want. Like I said, me, I go calorie smart. All my meals are 550 calories or below, but you could also choose protein plus keto vegan and veggie, even chef's choice. And then you pick how many meals you want each week. You can pick six, eight, 10, 12, 14 or 18 meals per week. Me, I go six because that's what I like to do for lunch. Every day I'll grab one of these, take it to the office. Well, once you place your order, factor gets delivered directly to your door all packed in a box with ice. It's never frozen. It's always fresh. It's always amazing. You take it out of the box and boom, you stick it in your fridge when you're ready. Bang. You take one out, pop it in the microwave. Two minutes. All right, babe. What do you want for lunch? We've got capotavi and Italian style pork ragu. We've got Parmesan and sun dried tomato chicken, penne. We've got herb grilled chicken, smoky, goot of chicken, garlic, butter, shrimp and cream kale or shredded chicken taco bowl. Smoky goot of chicken. Parmesan and sun dried spanish. Just an herb chicken, something. I want the herb chicken, whatever it was. Herb grilled chicken. Yeah. All right, gentlemen, here's the deal. We're going to go with the herb grilled chicken right there. I'm going to put in the microwave two minutes. But you know, the reasons why you are going to love factor as much as I do. Number one, it saves you time. You don't have to worry about going to the store, preparing all your meals, right? You can just basically order from factor and you know, the meals are going to be fresh. They're going to be high quality. And they are going to be on point in terms of the macros. And they're also most importantly going to be delicious. It's also going to save you money because instead of ordering out, we're doing like one of those like apps that like you spend like way too much money on like a burger, which you shouldn't be eating anyway. Right? You get a beautiful, delicious meal, super affordable, high quality, delivered directly to your door and you've got it and you're ready. Because for me, that's one of the things if I've got to think like when I'm hungry, like, ooh, what do I want? That's when I will personally make like bad decisions. But with factor, I know that I'm going to love every single thing I get. And every single week they've got like 35 different meals for you to choose from. The other thing that I love, I don't have to like clean up. Oh wait, it's ready. What I mean is like, I don't want to like do my dishes and stuff like that. With factor, right? You are ready to rock and it is delicious. Check it out, right? You've got the green beans. You've got the grilled chicken. You've got polenta. I literally wish you could smell this, but I also wish you could taste it. Speaking of tasting, all right, let's check it out. The moment of truth. Little polenta, little chicken. Mmm. Oh my. Oh my God. Little chicken, little polenta. That polenta's good. Is that good? It's so good. Guys, if you haven't tried factor, now is the time. If you go to factor75.com or click my link below, use my discount code 50 alpha m to get 50% off plus free shipping off your first order. That's code 50 alpha m at factor75.com to get 50% off plus free shipping off your first factor box. So I eat my lunch around like one o'clock, two o'clock. And then I work until about six. I go home and then I do an hour on the treadmill. All right. I told you I'm serious about getting this body back into shape. I am not having a dad bod. No sir, no way. It's not my metabolism getting older. It's me having to do better. Anyway, dinner time after my fasting cardio is basic, but it's amazing in terms of shredding fat. All right. Here's what we got. Actually, I'm going to start here. Sweet potatoes. All right. So sweet potatoes are like one of the greatest fat shredding carbohydrates out there. The way that I make it, right? This is what I would say is a medium sweet potato. All right. They're not like giant. They're not super small. Right about this in terms of weight. I don't weigh my food. I don't count my macros. I just know if I eat like this, I lose body fat and I look awesome. All right. So I'll take one of these. I'll wrap it in a paper towel, put it in the microwave. I don't poke holes, nothing for about five minutes. And then I let it cool down. Once it cools down, I basically unskin it, put it in the bowl. What I also put it in the bowl with is in this bag. All right. Meat. We got this. We got this. We got this. We got this. And we got this. All right. So here's the deal. So for dinner, I am combining basically my sweet potato with protein. Now, in terms of how much protein, it really depends on how hungry I am. But when I do this type of diet, I typically eat more than I used to. All right. So in terms of proteins, all right, bison, ground bison, you guys that like beef is better than beef. All right. For one, it's healthier. And the reason why it's healthier is they don't use antibiotics on bison. It's literally like illegal to in the US. All right. It's amazing. Great source of protein. It tastes delicious. It literally just tastes like a burger, but it's awesome. All right. Typically I'm going to have about half a pound. Sometimes if I'm really hungry, I might eat like literally a full pound of beef or bison every single night. And then chicken breasts. All right. Chicken breast is the most boring food out there. But when I'm dieting down, I'll make this, I'll grill them up and then I'll dip it in some type of sauce, whether or not it's like hot sauce or ketchup, maybe a little spoonful of hummus. It's great. Chicken breast, super lean, super amazing, super kind of okay. Chicken's like the least sexy protein out there. All right. What else do I got? All right. I also will make this. All right. This is a London broil. That is the cut of meat. All right. London broil is really lean. And if you cook it well, you put this whole thing on the grill, you slice it down, thin little strips. It is absolutely delicious. All right. It's lean, like I said, it's protein packed and it is amazing. All right. The more protein you eat, the leaner you're going to be because your body's going to utilize it. It's also not going to spike your insulin level and you need protein in order to basically gain big sexy muscles. And then the other type of protein that I'll eat is salmon. All right. Salmon, once again, is one of the greatest foods out there. All right. The reason, well, there are a few reasons. All right. Number one is protein number two, omega three fatty acids. Right. You keep hearing about all the amazing benefits of the fatty acids. Well, salmon is the protein that basically has the most omega three. It is amazing. And like I said, the more fat you eat, the healthy stuff, the more readily your body's going to give up or eliminate some of the stored fat, which is on your body. And so at least three times a week, I will eat salmon. All right. This would basically be two servings. Now the night that I don't eat salmon, I eat an avocado, that other half of the avocado. And the reason, once again, it's about giving myself the healthy fats. The other thing that this does is it satisfies that, like that craving. White dinner around like six, 37 o'clock. And then I don't typically go to bed until like 10. And so usually around like eight, 30 or nine, I get like hungry again. And I get a little bit of a sweet tooth. And so what I do is the alpha oats, right? Chocolate protein, a half a cup of oatmeal before I go to bed. It's going to give me some protein. It's going to give me some carbs and it works. Right. Now, some of you probably be like, Hey, you shouldn't eat carbs that late at night. For me, it works and it's effective. All the food though that I just showed you has been proven to me. But also there's a lot of data out there that supports the fact. If you eat a diet that is high in the foods that we went over in today's video, it's like not even a question. You are going to shred body fat. You're going to gain lean muscle and you are going to look amazing. Gentlemen, this is the year. Say no to the dad. But I'm doing my part. What about you? Who's joining me?"

And so what ends up happening is you dress too young and you look like you're trying too hard, or you dress too old and you look like an old man. And so today I'm going to go over some style mistakes that actually make you look older than you are. But I'm also going to teach you and show you how to actually fix it so that you can look stylish and elegant, but still mature, because really I feel like that's what the goal should be. We want to look stylish, but we don't want to look too old or too young. It's right in the middle. There's a sweet spot that we need to find, all right? And real quick before we get started, guys, if you dig this sweater that I'm wearing, it's a Merino wool polo that is absolutely perfect. It's from Collars and Go, maybe one in Navy? Like seriously? How sick is this? Gentlemen, if you don't have the Merino wool polo shirt, you need one in your wardrobe. It is a men's style essential. It looks amazing when dressed down with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. You can even throw it on underneath of a sport coat or a suit. The full zip Merino wool hoodie. Gentlemen, in terms of a stylish, mature, casual look, this is absolutely perfect, right? Went with some simple jeans, some black sneakers, a white t-shirt, and then the black collars and go Merino wool full zip hoodie over top, right? This hoodie isn't your daddy's hoodie. It's also not your little brother's hoodie. It's a mature, stylish option that you guys are absolutely going to love. The quarter zip hoodie. Guys, I love this shirt, right? It's more casual than the Merino wool, but it still just elevates the casual aesthetic. And this one, a waffle knit quarter zip, right? Perfect. Look how sexy, right? It's clean, it's casual, but it's elevated. It's not going to make you look like your little brother or your uncle Barry. Gentlemen, this is the deal. If you want to check out Collars and Go, there's a special link down below. If you go through my link, guys, you can grab anything that you want for an amazing price. They've got sweaters, they've got collars shirts, they've got the best polos on the market, they've got sport coats, and they've even got bad-ass outerwear. Gentlemen, check it out. This vest I recently got, it is absolute perfection. Guys, Collars and Go, they were on Shark Tank. Mark Cuban invested over a million dollars in this company because he knew they solved the problem. They're helping guys look amazing and not break the bank. Guys, hit the link, do not wait. Now, without any further ado, let's help you not look like your dad. Number one is old man eyewear. Eyewear, glasses, or sunglasses, right? If you choose incorrectly, it can make you look like a geezer, if I'm being honest, right? Stylish dudes, whether or not you're 18 or 85, are wearing glasses that have a little bit more structure, a little bit more substance. When you wear a cool pair of frames, it makes you look relevant. It also makes you look more youthful and stylish. Number two is ill-fitting clothing, whether or not it's too big, baggy, and boxy, or too skin tight. They're both horrible and make you look old. If you're wearing clothes that are way too tight, it makes you look like you're trying to cling on and hold on to your youth with your Kung Fu action grip. Gentlemen, don't do it. Also, don't wear big, oversized clothing. It makes you look dated, sloppy, and out of touch. Next up is pleated pants, all right? Pleated pants, whether or not they're corduroy, khakis, or even slacks, in my opinion, ages you. It makes you look older, right? In my opinion, you should opt for a flat front slack pant or chino. It's a lot better look. It's a lot cleaner as well. Dad jeans, all right? I'm just going to throw it out there. Deadam is also one of those things that makes you look older. If you're wearing frumpy, boring dad jeans and you're not like 16 years old, just being trendy, it automatically makes you look old. Guys, you got to update your style when it comes to your denim. A dark wash, straight, or slim fit is, in my opinion, going to be the best style on most men. Now, depending on your body, depending on your aesthetic, it could change. And when I say slim fit, I'm not talking about like skinny jeans. I'm just talking about the fact that they're not like super big and baggy. When you wear baggy or oversized jeans, it automatically makes you look shorter. It also doesn't accentuate the luscious booty. Big, bulky shoes or sneakers, all right? The dad sneakers, the reason why they're dad sneakers is because dads would wear them and they make you look old, right? I know that once again, they may be in style, but unless you're like literally 22 years old and you are like that dude that's like that stylish and you're probably not watching this video, it doesn't look good. It's not a good look, right? Those new balance aren't sexy. They make you look frumpy and they make you look old. Also, big clunky oversized shoes, whether or not they're slip on dress shoes with a big chunky sole or something like a boot that's just big and bulky. Once again, it makes you look out of touch, out of style and old. Too many patterns, all right? This is something that I see guys doing and I'm just like, dude, if you were just stick with solids, you wouldn't have anything to worry about. But what happens is guys start thinking, yo, I'm stylish, right? I like that shirt. It's got a stripe. I like that jacket. It's got a check. I like that tie. It's got circles or whatever. Gentlemen, here's the deal. When you try to mix and match too many patterns, it makes you look old because young, stylish, clean, crisp, sexy dudes aren't doing it. They're wearing monochromatic looks. They're wearing solid colors. The other thing you got to understand is that the solid colors, if it fits you properly and it's a classic style, it's going to be in style not only now, but in like five years from now. And if you take care of your clothing and buy higher quality clothing, it's automatically going to last you longer and look better, which brings me to something else that makes you look older and that is old clothing. All right? If you're wearing clothing that looks worn out, if it looks beat up, if it looks like it's out of date or out of style, once again, it makes you look old. Over layering. Okay? So here's the deal. I am a huge fan of layering. It's one of the great things that you can do as a stylish man to really add different textures and balance and just more dimension to an outfit. But there comes a point at which it's just too much. If you're wearing a collared shirt with a tie and a sweater and a vest and a jacket, anything more than like two layers, you got to be careful because it can look clunky. It can also look bulky. And the other downside to wearing too many layers is that it basically throws off the proportion of your body and can make you look heavier. And when you look heavier, you look older. Brings me to the next thing that makes you look older and that is heavy, chunky, bulky sweaters. All right? Now, I know that once again, it's a trend for younger guys to be wearing sort of the thicker weaves and the thicker fabrics that are a little bit bigger, oversized. But if you're a middle-aged guy and you're wearing the big, oversized, chunky sweater, unfortunately, it does tend to look a little bit old, in my opinion. Instead, what you should opt for is something thinner like a merino wool. It's going to drape a lot better on your body. It's also not going to make you look fat. Overaccessorization is also the next thing that makes you look older, right? It makes you look like you're trying way too hard to be young. Two, what I'd recommend is two well-chosen accessories, whether or not it's a single ring or a bracelet or a necklace and a cup or whatever, you've got to make sure you're not overdoing it, right? But the dude I see wearing multiple rings, bracelets, watches, earrings, real-talk earrings do make you look like you're trying to hold onto your youth or you're just outdated and out of touch. Overaccessorization, don't do it. Two, possibly three, but they got to be like grown-up accessories, not like cheap accessories like an Apple Watch and a Puka Shell necklace, whatever. Do better. Gentlemen, also your suit, you also need to make sure that you eliminate all the suit like bling. One of the problems that guys have is when they start to like get into style, they're like, yo, I got this suit, I'm going to be wearing like my pocket square, I'm going to wear cufflinks, I'm going to wear a tie bar, I'm wearing a little flower thing in my lapel. No, stop, like stop. Nobody does that that's stylish, all right? Once again, if you want to wear a simple white pocket square, presidential fold, fine. You want to wear cufflinks? Okay, make sure the cufflinks are subtle, not too big over the top and make sure you are coordinated. But the whole like matchy-matchy, lots of action, action, don't do it. The next thing that makes you look older is not paying attention to a leisure or athletic wear, all right? Or it makes you look like a fat Italian because think about it, you watch the Sopranos or any like mob movie, what are the guys wearing? The fat Italians, they're wearing like a white feeder with like a tracksuit on and then like new balance shoes. Do you think that looks stylish? No, it doesn't. It also makes you look like an old man. You got to upgrade, you got to do better, right? Lululemon, cuts, Vioree, like there are a lot of incredible at leisure wear brands that are going to fit really well. They're going to be monochromatic and they're just going to make you look more mature, stylish and sexy. So colors and patterns, all right? Lots of patterns we talked about, don't do it. Big patterns, don't do it, right? Big like horizontal stripes, horrible. Also, big loud, bright colors you want to stay away from. They make you look washed out, they also just don't make you look good, all right? If you are an older or a mature gentleman, you want to stick to more monochromatic looks, they're going to make you look tall, lean and sexy and you also need to avoid too many earth tones, all right? If you're wearing like way too many like browns and tans and greens, it's going to make you look like an old fart. Leather jackets, all right? Leather jackets are also something that are kind of like, they're kind of tricky. You've got to have the leather jacket aesthetic dialed in or else you look like bad. You look like an old dude trying to look too young, all right? What I'd recommend is something more minimal in terms of construction. A leather bomber jacket, great option. A simple zip moto jacket is fine. You just got to make sure there's not too many like zippers and like padding and all that nonsense or else you look like a dork. If you're wearing like a motorcycle jacket like Marlon Brando, this once again is a much more stylized option and you got to make sure you have the aesthetic dialed in. And the last mistake that makes you look older is being too dressed up for an event. That's more casual. Now, you can still like dress up without going like too overboard. But whenever I see a dude that's like all like suit tie, like perfectly like put together and everybody else is wearing like jeans or you know a casual sweater or something like that, it automatically makes that person look a little bit out of touch and also just like they had no clue what to wear. You know, one of the things that guys struggle with is how to dress casually but still look good and stylish. And that's one of the reasons why I love collars and coats so much. They make it simple. They make it easy. All right, to combine different items just to look good while dressing up but still keeping it casual. Cool guys, bottom line is this, if you avoid the things that we talked about in today's video, you're going to look great. You're also going to look stylish without looking like you're dad."

        "transcript": " What's up gentlemen, it's a it's a super emotional day for me. I've come to pay my respects What's up, man It's been a good run. I just wanted to come and say goodbye for now. I promise you'll be back You always come back like literally you're next to the mole. He died like 30 years ago huge year 2024 Skin fade it's time for us to go but until then I'm gonna give you something all the kids are talking about It's texture powder the biggest thing gentlemen. Let's get out of here today I'm gonna tell you why the fade officially kicked the bucket I'm also gonna go over some super sexy fresh styles that you can try that are lower maintenance and look amazing The first reason why I feel like you're not seeing it as much anymore is over saturation There was a time right for about ten years that like everybody in Social media everybody that was like stylish and like looking good and into their looks and their hair was getting some type of faded hair Style right whether or not it was super short or bald or a little bit longer This was the popular style and then up top it was gonna be a little bit more product a little bit more Effort in terms of styling and then guys got to realize that wow This is really annoying which brings me to the second reason and that is it's high maintenance In order for a tight fade to look good You basically have to go in every like two three weeks max or else it's gonna grow out and look terrible And so guys are like wow this really sucks I don't like having to make an appointment every two weeks to have fresh looking hair And so that is one of the other reasons why I feel like the fade is officially like kind of dead The other reason is it's expensive right going in to get a haircut whether or not it's a barber or a salon is gonna cost you like 30 to $50 every single time which brings me to the third reason guys are opting for more lower maintenance grooming routines All right, they don't want to fuck around and fuss with a bunch of products They don't want to use a bunch of like gels and paste and pomades and salts and this and that and then use flat irons or hairspray Or hairdryers they just pretty much want to style it put in the product and go right low maintenance Effortless style which brings me to the fourth reason and that is a return to classic styles All right, some of the styles that you're seeing that are becoming really popular We're popular like 20 30 40 50 years ago and they're back All right, and that's one of the things I just want to mention all right everything when it comes to style or grooming is Trendy and cyclical whatever is popular now won't be popular forever And what wasn't popular at one point will come back in the style all it the mullet is the perfect example right back in the day The mullet was like awesome and then it became like the butt of everybody's hair joke right it was terrible And now it's back bigger and better and longer than ever next reason is guys are embracing their natural textures All right before if you had curly hair wavy hair You try and straighten it or use a lot of product in order for it to be straight or to stand up now The beautiful thing is that guys are embracing the texture the more texture the better and the last thing and the last reason I feel is this shift in grooming trends the grooming trend in terms of a casual Sexy aesthetic is really gravitating more towards a messy casual intentional look what I mean by that is you want to look good But you don't want to look like you spent a lot of time looking good So now what I want to do is actually go over my pick for the best casual styles that look amazing All right the one product you need to know about is this one all right If you want to have a hairstyle that looks casual that doesn't look like you've got a lot of product in it This is what you need to check out. It's called the texturizing powder right? I'm gonna link to it down below along with the discount code right the way that it works is you just sprinkle a little bit in your hair a Little goes a long way and then you can style it any way you want you got to use it in dry hair And so don't have wet hair and put it in no your hair needs to be dry and then simply apply Shake a little in and regardless of if your hair is super short or a little bit longer It provides a little bit of hold a matte finish, but it is absolute Perfection you guys have got to try it. I'm gonna link to it down below So the first time we're gonna talk about is messy fringe Fringe is basically just having bangs coming down the hair isn't like up or really over It's just down casually, but the key to this looking amazing is having a lot of texture up top You've got to have different layers How are you gonna get that through the cut and the products you're using like I said? Sea salt spray is a must to give it a little bit of volume So it's not super flat and then the texturizing powder also is another great product now in terms of the cut You've got to look for a stylist that can actually go in and create different layers by using a razor a razor cut or Thinning shears or just a good scissor cut There's a huge difference in a stylist cutting your hair as opposed to a barber a barber typically is gonna be amazing at Fading not the best when it comes to cutting lengths and layers Upgrade your stylist and your hair will look better next style is the modern Mollet the mullet comes in a lot of different shapes and styles Right everything from really long in the back super tight on the sides short on top to everywhere in between The thing that I love so much about the mullet is that even though the sides are a little bit shorter Typically you can actually do it yourself Because you don't need to get like a mirror and like get all like reverse action on the back cut in the back Your hair is hard doing a fade yourself is almost impossible But tightening up the sides with beard grooming tools or hair cutting set Easy and the beautiful thing is that it doesn't need to be perfect like a nice perfect fade, right? They're fades and then they're like fucked up fades, right? I've gotten some really terrible fades for a fade to actually even look good It needs to be done by somebody that can actually fade hair the beautiful thing though Is that with the mullet something that's tight on the sides boom a little bit of fading? You're good to go combine it with a beard soul patch or a mustache You're killing it the next one is the wolf the wolf is like the new sexy style on the block this year And typically it's a mullet that grew out the layers are gonna be a little bit longer The hair is gonna be a little bit longer. It's gonna be long in the back long in the front long in the sides It's gonna be casually draping over your face But in order for the wolf's cut to look good or any longer style to look good You've got it once again have texture. You've also got to have a proper haircut It doesn't work to just have straight hair, right all one length. It looks bad. It looks flat It looks lifeless gotta get the levels you've got to get the layers you've got to get a little bit of volume That's what makes it look so amazing The next style is the flow right a little bit longer not as long as the wolf in the back But it's basically a casual style the hair is medium length pushed back casually kind of draping back It looks amazing. All right a very casual elegant style Definitely a little bit more youthful and old money now speaking of old money the next style is the classic side part I love the side part because it comes in a lot of different variations in the old days If you wanted to do some type of hard part with the skin fade that was like the ultimate of maintenance It was a pain in the ass now. It's a more casual side part the sides aren't as tight They're a little bit longer So you can actually go three or four weeks in between cuts and not have it grow out But the beautiful thing is that when the sides aren't super tight You can simply grab your beard grooming tool or scissors and just edge up around your ear in order to keep the haircut Looking good for longer the French crop and the Caesar cut also Amazing now a lot of times you're gonna see these with very tight You know faded sides, but what I'm talking about is hair that's grown out a little bit not super tight on the sides It's a more casual almost more natural look, but either way they look amazing once again It's about the texture you got to make sure you've got lots of texture lots of movement and not have a hair that looks crunchy Or stiff if you do it makes you look like you've got a helmet the key to these styles is the natural playfulness Once again, it's about a casual look that doesn't look like you took too much time The last style is the slick back the slick back is an incredibly versatile style All right you can do this style with some of the other styles that we talked about and it's one of the ways that you can basically Dress it up or elevate it if you are somebody that is in a professional environment or you're going to a black tie affair Some type of you know nice wedding all you got to do is basically push your hair back off of your face All right, hold it in place with a high hold low shine product like a peat and pager putty or Some type of higher hold high shine product if you want that wet look But the bottom line is that the slick back is a great versatile style that looks amazing. It's casual It's playful and it's also like badass like drug lord Miami Vice sexy bottom line is this it works What doesn't work is a skin fade because it's a pain in the ass Rest easy amigo rest easy"

        "transcript": " What's up guys? Today I want to talk about something that happened to me last year in 2024 that's possibly going to happen to you because honestly we are facing a burnout epidemic. Last year I burned out. Simply put, I was unmotivated, I was not happy, and I was thinking about all the reasons why I didn't want to work anymore. You know, for me I've always bitten off a lot, right? I'm a hard worker. That's what I do. That's what gets me up in the morning and I've always up until last year really been passionate and excited about it. But there was a point last year where I realized something's got to change because I am not happy. And it was really because of, well there are a few reasons why it happened. And today I want to actually unpack it. I want to talk about burnout in general. I also want to talk about why it's happening and why it's on the rise. But I also want to give you some actionable steps on how you can fix it or prevent it. So what is burnout anyway? Well, essentially it's a chronic state of physical, emotional, or mental exhaustion brought on by a constant state of stress. Alright, this is very different than just being tired. Being tired is something that happens basically once in a while, right? You don't get a good night's sleep or you stay out too late. You wake up and you're like, God, I'm so tired. That's not burnout. You're just tired and need to get more rest. Alright, being burnout leaves you feeling emotionally drained and detached a lot of times. Not to mention it makes you struggle to be productive. And the problem is that when you feel burnout, it also manifests in other unhealthy ways. A lot of times you're going to skip going to the gym. You might even self-medicate. You might drink a little bit too much or do drugs or whatever. You might not be as present when it comes to your relationship or with your children. And it's just this overwhelming feeling of being stuck, stagnant. It almost feels like you're on this treadmill, right? You're showing up. You're doing the same thing day in, day out, and you're not feeling that energized excitement that you used to or you're not seeing the reward or you feel like you're working more and more and more. You might not make any more money or you just might not be as productive as you used to, right? This is what being burnout is all about. And in my opinion, it's reached an epidemic proportion in our society, but more specifically men with the pressures that we feel and face to be all these things, to have an incredible family, to make a ton of money, to always be grinding and hustling because of the rise of the hustle culture, not to mention social media, right? Social media makes us feel bad about ourselves because we don't have or when we look at it, we see all these other people that are grinding and hustling. It makes us feel like if we're not doing that and working all the time, we're a failure. Our productivity as a country, as a society, and as a gender has been on the increase, the rise, right? We are encouraged and expected these days to work harder, to work longer, but unfortunately our pay has not seen the same pace or growth as the productivity or the output that we're actually doing, which again leads to us feeling disassociated or dissatisfied with what we're actually doing. There's nothing worse than working really hard, giving your time, giving your effort, being productive for somebody who doesn't value it or you don't feel that they do in the manner at which they should. Not to mention the feeling of insecurity with your job. With the rise of AI, a lot of jobs are going to go away. This is scary. Something else that's scary is the fact that all these companies now are laying people off. It's scary. It is scary as hell when you've got responsibilities and you don't know whether or not you're going to have a job or you're going to get laid off, which is going to in turn make you work harder to prove to them that you're worth it, but then you're not going to be compensated for the effort. One of the other big issues is that we as men don't talk about it. I know that I didn't. I didn't explain to people, Hey, I'm feeling super burnout or this is going on with me. Most men just suck it up because that's what we are expected to do, which leads to all sorts of problems. And that's one of the other things burnout affects more than just your mind. It affects your body. It affects your relationships. It affects every aspect of your life when you don't feel good about what you're doing or how you're doing it. So what I want to do now guys is go over some of the things that I did and that you can do in order to basically stop this or prevent it from happening. It's all the things that I'm going to share with you are things that I did or I know would be beneficial for you to break the cycle and the feeling of burnout. All right. The first thing I just want to mention real quick is no one you need some help. All right. And what I mean by that is like I said earlier, a lot of men never learn to talk about the things that are going on. You've got to prioritize your mental health. One of the things that I'd recommend each and every one of you do is go see or talk to a therapist for me every time I've used therapy in the past, my life just levels up. They gave me tools that I could use in order to deal with the issues of the situations that I was facing that were basically preventing me from feeling good because gentlemen at the end of the day, that's what it's all about feeling good and being happy. Better help is today's video sponsor and they are on a mission to make starting therapy easier. Guys, there's a link down below this video. I want you to go and check it out, fill out and answer a few questions and then better help is going to be able to match you with the therapist that's going to be best suited to help you with your needs. And usually you're going to be able to start therapy in a few days. The thing that I love about better help is that it's comfortable, right? Because I've done traditional therapy with like me going into an office, sitting across from somebody. And honestly, it's a little bit awkward and takes a little bit of time to really like get into the flow. It's not that it doesn't work, but with better help, the platform is designed to make starting therapy or having your therapy sessions any way that you find most convenient, but also most comfortable. The other thing I love about better help is that they allow you to change therapist for free if it's not the right fit because there are a lot like dating. All right, I don't want you to think, Oh, I'm going to try therapy and it's not an exact fit. I don't really connect with this person. Therapy's bad. No, it's just that that therapist isn't right for you. Better help allows you to change to somebody else to find that perfect person that connects with you that can help you be your best self. Better help carefully vets their therapist to make sure that they are well qualified. They also have an amazing customer support team that is there to help or answer any questions. Guys, they've got over 7000 reviews with an average 4.5 stars on trust pilot, which means better help is a company you can trust guys. Hit the link down below. If you go through my special link, betterhelp.com slash alpha M that's B E T T E R H E L P dot com slash alpha M. You're going to get 10% off your first month of therapy. Guys, do not wait. Now is the time that's better help.com slash alpha M. You deserve to be happy. You deserve to feel great and better help can help you make it happen. Second step to avoid or overcome burnout is to change your mindset when it comes to this whole idea that you've got to be busy at all costs guys. It's not about constantly being busy. It's about being productive and effective with the time that you're spending too often. We fall into this trap where we just work and we think that if we just work longer and harder that it's going to solve our problem when honestly it just makes everything worse. I used to think that I needed to always be working and busy and if I wasn't then something was wrong with me and I was a slacker, right? Which led to the whole like burnout problem in the first place. The truth is if you are constantly working and not letting your brain rest, it's going to basically make you less productive with the things that you're actually doing. You've got to have time for your brain to unplug. If this means go exercise. If it means go for a jog. If it means go on a vacation. If it means take weekends off or even just like a Sunday, take it off. The next step is set boundaries for other people but also yourself. And this is something that was hard to do. But for me, I knew, okay, if I don't all right, set some boundaries for myself and make myself take some time off or decompress, I'm not going to be good for anybody and it's just going to perpetuate the problem. You've got to set boundaries for yourself but also for other people, including your boss or your job. You've got to have the ability to decompress and set boundaries. No, I'm not going to answer that email right now and drop everything. You can still get everything done if you're more disciplined with your time and the way that you actually manage it, which brings me to the next step. Be better at managing your time. Making a schedule and sticking to it as closely as possible is very important now. Of course, if you've ever tried to make a schedule, you know the things are going to come up and things aren't going to happen, but it's about having a structure. The more disciplined and structured you can make your day, the easier you're going to find it to fit in the things that you need to do. Reassess your commitments. This one was really hard for me. And I think that truly the reason why it got to the breaking point this year or this past year was because I've been doing extracurricular businesses for a long time. Also, I've been doing a lot of extracurricular real estate. I built myself a house. I renovated this loft. I bought a house for my mom. I renovated that. Then I did the salon. Renovated that. And then I built myself another house, which was super stressful. I didn't realize how stressed out and burned out I was until basically it was over. One day I was just like, oh my god, this is done and I feel amazing. Combine that with the fact that I still had all the things that I had to do in terms of my business and these other commitments, which brings me to the point. You've got to reassess and you've got to be honest with yourself. Don't say yes to things if you're not going to have the time to actually do it or do it well. Physical activity. You need to make it a priority. Every day you need to do something that's good for your body. That's also going to be good for your mind. If you are not taking care of yourself physically, you are not going to basically last. You've got to take care of your body or temple. Something else is your nutrition. If you're eating like shit, you're not going to be fueling your brain with the good nutrients it needs in order to basically be effective, efficient, and feel good. And then sleep. You've got to prioritize sleep. In a world of BOMO or everybody's scared they're going to miss out on things or you spend time just aimlessly scrolling or watching shit on Netflix that is terrible and trash TV, you've got to make sleep a priority. Now I'm not saying that watching TV or decompressing is bad, not at all, but you've got to make sure sleep is a priority. It's about reverse engineering your day. If you know you've got to get up at this time so that you have time to do X, Y, and Z, you need seven or eight hours. What time do you need to go to bed? And don't just lay in bed watching TV or aimlessly scrolling, which brings me to something else. You've got to detox digitally. A digital detox to whatever extent you can detox from it is imperative that you do because it's going to impact you in a lot of different ways. Number one, it's going to help reset and recalibrate your dopamine. It also is going to not make you waste time. The amount of time that we waste aimlessly surfing or looking at porn or social media is very detrimental to us. It also is impacting the way that we feel about ourselves because when we see these other people working or grinding or buying stuff that we feel like we should have, it once again perpetuates this hustle culture. Guys, you've got to break the cycle. For me, I just start being more thankful for the things that I have and grateful for the things that I've accomplished and being more present in my life. All right. And really embracing time with my loved ones, friends, and family and the things that I get to do that aren't work. Right. For me, I've always hated vacations because vacations meant that I wasn't able to work the way that I normally do. I always felt like if I took a vacation and I, and I rested and I didn't like, I wasn't like always working that something was going to go wrong. It was this weird like phobia of going on vacation and like just relaxing and not always like checking my email, checking my phone and checking the things that I felt like I need to check. And when I realized that you know what, you've done a good enough job to delegate the things that can basically be done by somebody else and the world will not end if you don't answer an email for two days. That's something that once again, it was hard for me to learn, but when I did, it's incredibly powerful. All right. There's time to do everything you need to do. And when you come back, you're going to be more effective, more efficient, and you're going to be more productive. And the last thing I'd like to leave you with is just some food for thought. If you feel like you're burnout and you dread going to work, you got to analyze the situation. If you don't like what you're doing, that's a problem. If you don't like who you're doing it with, your coworkers, that's also a problem or who you're doing it for your boss, who you're making rich. If you don't like those things, you got to change jobs. Life is too short to hate what you do for seven, eight, nine hours a day. That could be the problem and why you feel so burnout. But even when you find something that you enjoy doing, it's still going to be work and you're still going to have to manage the situation to not feel burnout. Unfortunately, it is an epidemic of massive proportion, lots of reasons for that, some of which we talked about, but the bottom line is this, you need to take care of you."

        "transcript": " So there's some cars that make you look like a huge redneck, like a super jacked up truck. Some cars make you look like you got a teeny weeny, like a lime green Lambo. Some cars make you look like you like girls, like a Subaru, any Subaru. Some cars make you look like a virgin, like if you got a bunch of bumper stickers and stuffed animals in your car, you know what I'm talking about. Some cars make you look like a tech bro, like a Tesla. And some cars make you look like a huge dumbass, like a Range Rover. Alright, if I see a dude and he's driving a Range Rover, I automatically know he's not that smart. owning a Range Rover is kind of like dating a stripper. You know it's a bad idea. Everybody's told you it's a terrible idea. But you're like, but maybe just once, right? Because it's so sexy. And so you buy it, three months later, you can't open the sunroof. Like I actually can't open the sunroof. Why? Because it's a Range Rover and they suck, gentlemen. What doesn't suck is the cars I'm going to go over in today's video. These cars, I feel make you actually more attractive. Alright, that's my list. If you agree with it, great. If you don't agree with it, I'm cool with that. But down below, I want to know in your opinion, what is a car that a guy can drive that will actually make him more attractive? Alright, please note, none of these are super cars. I'm not going with that whole list, right? They're unattainable for 99.9% of guys. I want to go with some affordable cars. Some are a little bit pricey, but a lot of them are kind of like mid-tier, mid-range. But I feel like these are sexy, masculine, alpha cars. Some other things I want you to know. Drive whatever you can afford. Don't get overextended in terms of cars. Alright, that's one of the big mistakes that guys make when they're young. They think, oh, I need a really super badass expensive car in order to look cool and feel good. Gentlemen, don't believe the hype. There are some affordable, amazing cars out there that make you look super confident, alpha, and most importantly, are reliable. A few things you need to know. It doesn't matter the car that you're driving. You got to keep it clean and you also need to make sure that it doesn't smell like your ass. Alright, and so what I'd recommend is once a week, once a month, clean your car inside and out. And also, what I'd recommend in terms of the fragrances is grab this. Alright, this is drift. Have you guys heard about drift? I've talked about it before. This is amazing. I've got a special link down below. I've also got that QR code. If you scan it or go through my link, you're going to get 55% off your first month of drift. You can also use my special code, alpha 55, to get that 55% off your first month of drift. So drift makes air care products for your home and your car. The product that I love is the car freshener. This thing is amazing, alright? And the reason why I love drift so much as opposed to any other like car air freshener is that they don't use like super synthetic chemicals and scents that are bad for you. All of the essential oils and things that they use to make the drift products smell the way that they do are good, they're healthy, they're botanicals, they're essential oils and they smell amazing. Alright, super like masculine without being like too overpowering. So the way that it works guys, month number one, you're going to get this, right? It's going to come with your first scent. It's also going to come with this metal clip that basically just goes right on your visor. Then on the back, a little magnet, all you do, boop, that's it. It stays in place, it doesn't move, and then your car is going to smell sexy as hell all month long. This scent that I recently got is called Frosted Pine. It is so sexy. It is like you're in the wilderness, right? It's like pine trees and like juniper berries and like fir trees, just so sexy. Alright, the bottom line is this though. What I personally would recommend is sign up for the scent of the month club, where each month they're going to send you a new fragrance because scent blindness is a thing. If you smell something over and over and over and over again, even if it smells amazing, you start to not like notice it. This is a great way to change it out monthly and always have a great smelling scent in your car. I've got a special QR code scan that or use the discount code and go through my special link in the description to get 55% off your first month of drift, which means it's going to be under $5. It's a huge car, no brainer. Guys, hit the link. It started today. Drift smells amazing. Alright gentlemen, so now without any further ado, let's talk about the sexiest cars a guy can drive. I should say the cars that make you extra sexy. Number one is a truck, alright? A truck in my opinion is a sexy option, but it can't be like a dirty like work truck. It's got to be like clean. It's also got to maybe be a little bit more like rugged in terms of a possibly a small lift or some non-stock tires, right? You want something with a little bit of bulk, a little bit of girth, alright? An F-250 great option, a Toyota Tacoma also great. I think trucks are super sexy. Number two is a Jeep, alright? But once again, the Jeep can't be like a stock like standard like drive off the lot Jeep. It's got to be a little bit more robust. You need a little bit of girth, right? Bigger in tires, a little bit of a lift, nothing like too big and like aggressive, but just more of a manly Jeep, alright? In my opinion, super sexy. And when people see you driving a Jeep that's a little bit more rugged and manly, makes you more rugged and manly. Number three is a Bronco. I really think Bronco has knocked it out of the park in terms of a great newer addition to an old classic, alright? But once again, just like with the Jeep, it can't be like stock, right? You see some Broncos and you're like, uh, no thanks. Some you're like, damn, that's sexy, right? You got to lift it a little bit. You got to put some sexy bigger tires on there. Number four is pretty much anything German. German cars, they do a really good job making sexy cars that are just attractive, right? Even like the lower end models that aren't like technically like low end are just like classic. They're clean and they are definitely sophisticated and elegant looking, in my opinion, everything from Mercedes. I think like almost like every Mercedes looks good. Some of the like SUVs and like the minivans aren't like super like attractive, but a lot of the Sedans sexy, right? They've got good like aggressive grills and they're just a classic car. Alright, some other ones, right? The SUV, I don't know the name of it, but it looks like kind of like a bubble and it's kind of aggressive looking kind of mean also. Super badass. The G-Wagon, in my opinion, is one of the most overhyped vehicles out there. But once again, it definitely does send a message that you are a probably well off and successful and that in and of itself is attractive. When you see somebody whether or not it's like a nice watch or something that you know is like expensive, it correlates to success. And when you see somebody that is successful, it is attractive, right? That is an attractive quality. So don't get it twisted and don't lie to yourself. Alright, do people notice cars? The answer is yes. Alright, so if you got a nice one, it definitely is going to make you more attractive. Some other German vehicles that I love, Audi's, I love like every Audi. I think they look great. The SUV's, the sedans, the sports cars, sick, sexy, amazingly attractive. BMW also, I think they're sexy. I think they're actually, I don't think BMW's are as sexy as like Audi's or Mercedes, but I just think they are classy. And whenever I see a dude rockin' or driving a BMW or a woman driving a BMW because seeing a woman driving a nice car, you know it automatically like boosts their sex appeal. Same thing happens to men, right? But BMW's, I think, are just a classic, amazing car and pretty much every model looks great and every model makes you look more attractive. Alright, some of the SUV's, like the smaller SUV's, not as much, but even like an old BMW, I think looks great. Alright, Porsche, probably in my opinion, the sexiest car on the road. Now I'm not talking about super cars like I said. These are like, like goal cars, not like grail cars, alright? But the Porsche, in my opinion, you don't get much sexier than a Porsche 911, lots of different models, but you can also grab some that are used or pre-owned for a good price, alright? Even like a Boxster, I think is sexy. Mustang, didn't make my list. Dodge Chargers, also not on my list. Alexis, right? How can you beat Alexis? They're not super like crazy like pricey, but they still are luxurious and they're reliable. Most importantly, they are reliable. And I think some of the smaller, more affordable ones also are incredible. Like the 250, the i-250, my wife used to have one, I borrowed it for a while, I drove it around, it was zippy, it was sexy, it was amazing. Accurus, are kind of in that same like zone as, as, as Lexus. Not super premium, but if somebody sees you driving it, it's like, okay, he's obviously made it. He's not driving like a piece of crap, he's not going to overboard because his confidence and his ego doesn't require him to get something like a Mustang or a Hellcat. But the bottom line is, you're reliable, you're responsible, and you appreciate reliability. Big SUVs is the next thing on the list. Anything like an Escalade? I think they're sexy, whatever, whatever, whatever you want to say about Cadillacs, I think Escalades are attractive. You know, some other ones, you know, Tahoe's are great. There are a lot of incredible bigger SUVs out there that honestly, in my opinion, makes you look more masculine and a little bit more, I don't know, probably, it makes you look probably like you've got a family, honestly, and you're not driving like a minivan. Whenever I see somebody driving like a big SUV, that's what connects with me. And as you know, whenever a woman sees a dude and he's married, he's got a ring on, or he's driving one of these family cars, it automatically makes him be perceived as more attractive to those single spicy senoritas, because women love married dudes, but you're married, so be a good boy. And if you don't, your wife's going to get you a minivan, which is the last on my list. I personally love a minivan. Whenever I see a dude driving a minivan, I think, bro, I got you, right? Not only are you confident in your masculinity, your ruggedness, you're like, yo, whatever, this bitch is spacious. I got a few rows of seats. It's easy to get in the back to get my sexy on with my spicy senorita when the kids aren't in there. I'm telling you, the minivan is a much underrated automobile for dudes. If you rock one, you're confident. If you rock one, you're the man. And if you rock any of these that I talked about in today's video, you are more attractive. And guys, don't forget, hit the link down below, use that discount code, or scan my custom QR code to get 55% off your first month of drift. But while you're there, I want you to also check out their home diffusers, because they've got products not only for your car, they've got some for your home that you are absolutely going to love.

You know, I look at you and I see greatness, nothing but potential. But a lot of you are making some mistakes or have things in your life that are preventing you from realizing your goals and your potential and today I really wanted to do a video just to basically share with you some things that I feel you need to cut out if you truly want to be successful and make 2025 the best year yet. But bottom line, you're awesome. First thing, I need you to stop doing and cut out of your life is hanging out with those people that don't deserve you. All right, I'm talking about toxic people. We all have had them in our lives. Unfortunately, sometimes they're hard to identify because they're kind of shady. They're kind of shifters, right? In terms of they act like they love you one minute. They act like they're your friend and then typically they're going to turn around, talk shit about you, stab you in the back, or not live up to your expectations of what you deserve of a friend. The next thing I need you to stop doing this year is blaming yourself or beating yourself up for shit that happened before. Whether or not it's a failure, something you did wrong, let it go. It is time to let it go. It's also time for number four, you to cut out the grudges. I know that there are people that have done you dirty. I've felt the same thing. Whether or not it's a family member or a friend. Unfortunately, we are a lot of times collateral damage in other people's shit. The thing that's going to help you move forward finally is to either forgive them, which I know that that's hard, right? A lot of people say, oh, I can't forgive them because they did a lot of terrible things and I get that, right? It's not about forgiving them. It's about forgiving you. It's about letting the shit go. Not harboring so much anger and resentment because when you're bogged down by anger, resentment, hostility, and those feelings, it's preventing you from moving forward. You've got to set it down. The next thing you need to cut out this year is excuses. Stop it. Just like stop it, right? Excuses make us feel good or justify our inactions or reasons why we didn't accomplish or didn't do the things that we said we were going to do last year, but you got to stop. You got to understand that nobody's always used shit. Nobody's going to come and save you. If you truly want to be successful, you've got to take action, but you've got to own it. You've got to stop making the excuses. Stop excusing your inaction or bad behavior. And I'm not trying to say this to be a dick. I'm trying to say this because I love you. And I know from personal experience that when I drop the bullshit and stop making excuses, look myself in the mirror and decide, you know what, there's nobody that's going to do this other than you. It's amazingly powerful. It basically frees you from the burden. Something else that's going to free you from burden is comparing yourself to other people. Cut that shit out. It only makes you feel bad about yourself. This is the year for you to look forward, to do better, to be at the end of 2025 being like, damn, I fucking killed it. Alpha was right. But when you sit there and compare yourself, your life, your relationship, your finances to other people, it prevents you from moving forward and being happy and satisfied with yourself. Guys, you're amazing. Only compare yourself to you, the man you were yesterday. Next thing I need you to cut out this year is all the toxic shit you're consuming. All right, now I know that this list is kind of like big and it's going to be a little bit hard to do everything. But if you just basically cut out one or two of these things, you're going to be so much better off. All right, the junk food. Stop eating it. You got to start preparing your meals. The next thing is that stuff, right? The stuff you smoke. Stop it. Whether or not it's weed, it's nicotine. Stop it. It is doing you no good. It's actually hurting you. And all the excessive drinking. Stop it. Finally, get it under control. If I can do it, you can do it. Excessive social media. Cut it out. I'm not saying to never check social media ever, but if you're somebody that finds themselves looking multiple times a day and wasting time here, it's preventing you from doing amazing things in 2025. The other thing you need to cut out is shit sleep. If you're not getting good sleep, there's zero chance that you're going to do amazing things this year. You're going to be tired. You're going to be sluggish. You're not going to look good. You're not going to feel good. Now, to mention, your testosterone is going to be all out of whack. Guys, make sleep a priority. Seven to eight hours of solid summer every single night. Period. Negative self-talk. Cut that shit out. Stop it. Right now, I know that a lot of you are like, but, but, but what if I don't? Or I'm going to try. What if I got, fuck it. Like seriously, stop it. That negative self-talk is going to do nothing, but like cause you to second guess yourself, cause you to procrastinate, which is something else you got to cut out this year. Stop procrastinating. Procrastination is the devil. Right. And we trick ourselves. We think, I'll do it later. Right. And later turns into like a week, a month, and then never think about it like this. Where would you be today if you took action and actually implemented the things you need to do back when you first started thinking about starting a business, getting a new job, getting in the shape, asking that girl out. Where would you be today? Think about that. It's powerful. Do not let another year go by with you thinking about doing something. Take action and stop waiting. Stop setting unrealistic expectations for yourself. That's something else you've got to stop doing. Right. Also over committing. How many of you over commit? You're like, okay, this year I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this. And then you end up doing all of them or none of them half ass. You got to pick a few things. One thing that you're going to commit yourself to this year. Is it your body? Is it your job? Is it your career? Is it your mental health? Like what is it? Is it your relationship? Pick one thing or two things max and focus every ounce of your energy on doing that thing. And I promise you, if you do that, you're going to be successful. But when you're over committed, you pick too many things. You have shiny object syndrome. You start chasing a bunch of shit. You're never going to do any of it well or any of it at all. Your body. You knew this one was coming, right? From me, guys, here's the deal. Stop. Like just cut it out. Stop making the excuses of why you're not exercising and why you're not in better shape and why your body fat is over 20%. If your body fat is over, I would say like 18%. You got a problem and it's time for you to fix it. You know, spoiler alert, it gets harder as you get older. The earlier you start making good choices, better habits, the easier it's going to be to stick to them as you get older. If you don't take an active role and make your health a priority, I promise you something. You will regret it. Period. You will regret it. And money cannot buy better health. It can buy better access to health, but it can't buy being healthy. And your health is your number one most valuable asset. The other thing I need you to cut out this year is thinking that money is going to solve all your problems. No, it doesn't. All right. What money does is simply give you access to solving problems and it makes life easier. But you're always going to have problems. You're always going to have issues and just buying something isn't going to make you happy. If you are not happy and true to who you are as a person, as a man, no amount of stuff or material possessions can fix that. You've got to be good with you. You've got to figure out what's going to make you happy and go for it, which brings me to the last thing I just want to go over. And that is you got to cut out fear. Now, fear is one of those ugly motherfucking things that wreaks its havoc in a lot of different ways. Fear is invisible. Nobody sees it other than you, but you feel it and it's real. And it's also the thing that's preventing you from doing incredible things. The reason why you don't try, whether or not it's a business, your body, that girl, that job is because of the fear, the fear of failure, the fear of embarrassment, the fear of having to tell your parents or your loved ones that it didn't work out or that it didn't work. But I promise you something. Fear is going to diminish when you take action and fail. Failure, you got to do it. It's part of the process. It's inevitable. You can't get successful without having that one piece, which is failure. All right. Nobody got successful at anything without fucking something up in the beginning. You've got to f it up in order to learn, in order to move forward. It's part of the process. But fear is one of those things that I beg you to get under control. You've got to let it go. You've also got to understand that people aren't thinking about you the way that you think they are. The world doesn't revolve around you. And this when I heard this, it was kind of like, wait, what do you mean, right? But think about it. If you spent less time worrying about what other people thought of you and just did what you wanted to do in anything, you would be so much better off. You'd also take better steps and actions in order to make it happen. But the thing that holds us back is the fear of other people, what they're thinking, what they're saying. And the truth, they're not saying shit. They're worried about their own self. They're not even thinking about you. And the sooner you understand this, the sooner you cut it out of your life, the better off you're going to be. Gentlemen, I love you. I want 2025 to be your best year yet. And if you cut this shit out, it will be."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, welcome to the last official alpha M video of 2024. And quite frankly, I'm glad this bitch is over because it was a hard year for me personally, professionally, had some accomplishments that I'm proud of, have some things that I've got to work on, and some things that I can finally let go of because they're in the rearview mirror. And I can't go back and change things. But what I can do is look towards the future and this new year as a way of changing things that I want to change, but also just being better and achieving more and making 2025 the best year yet. Today, guys, I want to go over a few things that you need to hear, but also accept in 2025. Number one, is your appearance matters now more than ever in a world dominated by social media and our appearance and the way that people receive and perceive us. You cannot afford not to pay attention to your style, to your grooming, to your fitness, to the way that you look. Number two, nobody is coming to save you. Fact. Self-reliance is critical in this fast-paced, hyper-competitive world. But if you're sitting around and waiting for somebody else to give you a hand or come and save you, you're going to be waiting forever and you're never going to achieve shit. You've got to take responsibility for your actions, your finances, and your future. Number three, time is your most valuable asset. You've got to protect it and invest it wisely. If you're investing this precious asset in people or relationships that are toxic or not good for you, you've got to do a better job because once that time is lost, once it's gone, you can never get it back. Spend less time on social media in 2025. I promise, you're not missing anything. Your social circle is going to shape your success. I've said it often. If you surround yourself with losers, you're unfortunately probably not going to ever achieve what you could. When you surround yourself with people that are uplifting, that are supportive, that love you, that are going to basically help you facilitate a healthier, happier life, you're going to be in a much better position. But if you're surrounding yourself with people that don't deserve you or that will never love you or treat you in the manner that you deserve, you've got to get rid of them. Nobody cares about your excuses. So stop making them. Or you can keep making them, but understand that they are simply your way of making yourself feel better about why you failed or didn't succeed. Guys, the fact is the world rewards action. And if you are somebody that is stuck in a perpetual cycle of, oh, it didn't work. And this is why you got to stop it. You got to figure out why it didn't work. Stop talking about it. Fix the things that need to fix and move forward. Rejection, it sucks, but it's also inevitable. Rejection is the natural part of life. The sooner you understand, the sooner you're going to basically be able to accept it and move on. Rejection is going to happen in careers and relationships and life. Don't dwell on it. Learn from it and move forward. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it can buy you freedom. All right. This is something you've got to understand. Money is a tool. It's a tool to use. And when you have it, when you have financial freedom, then you can basically explore your passions or be surrounded by people that you want to be around. It gives you options. Money won't buy you happiness. Buying that car, making a million dollars. It's not about the thing or the stuff. It's about what it allows you to do. Comparison is the thief of joy and happiness. What I mean by that, if you're spending your time comparing yourself to other people, what they have, what they don't have, like whatever, it's going to rob you of feeling good about yourself and the joy that you should have because of the person and the man that you are, but also the things that you've achieved. You may not be where you want to be and that's okay. 2025 is the year for you to refocus, recalibrate and take action. Comfort zones kill growth. When you're comfortable, right? You're not striving. You're not trying. For me, I know I've got to be uncomfortable. If everything's like, good, I'm like, uh, something's wrong. I got to change things up because I know that when things are hard, when they're challenging, that's where true growth comes from. And I know that it's not just me. You've got to be uncomfortable or you've got to be unsatisfied and looking to be better personally, professionally and just do something better than what you're currently doing. Mental health requires maintenance. All right. You can't just ignore stress or anxiety or depression and think it's going to go away. It actually gets worse. You've got to do the things you got to do in order to get it in check. If it means forgiving people, if it means getting another job, if it means exercising, if it means seeking therapy, you need to do it. All right. And then you need to have routine check-ins. Like how am I feeling like seriously? Because unfortunately, a lot of times when you get into this vicious cycle of stress or anxiety or not feeling good about yourself, you can't even like see it for what it is until you do the things you need to do. And then all of a sudden it's like, wow, I was really in a bad place. You'll never please everybody. So stop trying. The one person you need to worry about is you. Are you happy? Are you pleasing yourself? Are you doing and living a life that inspires you? That's exciting. It's 2025, the year that you finally get out of your own way and make your dreams come true. You got to set goals. You got to have goals, but they've got to be your goals. Physical fitness, your health, non-negotiable. It doesn't matter if you've got a busy schedule. It doesn't matter if you've got a family. It's non-negotiable. You've got to figure it the fuck out because without your health, literally nothing else matters. It doesn't matter how much money you have. Your health is one of the things that money can't buy more of. The world doesn't revolve around you. And I'm not saying that to be like a dick. I'm just saying like, realize that people aren't thinking about you the way that you think that they are. And this thinking that they're thinking about you is what prevents us from trying or doing the things that we want to do. They're so worried about their own life, they're not thinking about you. They don't give a shit about what you're doing. Focus on you and stop worrying about what other people think. And remember, failure is a stepping stone for success. And without failure, honestly, you're never going to be successful. You got to understand that. Failure a lot of people think of it as a bad thing, right? Oh, I failed. I don't want to fail. Oh, what if I fail? Right? I get it because I've been there. I've had over 20 businesses. A lot of them have failed. But each time one of them fails, I learn a little something and it moves me closer and makes me better, makes me smarter, makes me faster and makes me more money in the long term. You've got to understand that failure is part of the process. And past failures don't dictate future successes. This is something you've got to understand. And this goes for relationships, but also professionally as well. You might have failed at a diet before. It doesn't mean you're going to this time. You might have failed at that business. It doesn't mean you're going to this time. You might have failed in a relationship before. It doesn't mean that this next relationship is going to be a failure. The only way you fail is if you don't try again, if you don't move forward. And last, literally last, is you're going to die someday. And so am I. Understanding this and realizing that nobody's figured out a loophole and that you are not invincible. Nobody is. Is something that I find incredibly important, but also very powerful when you think about it. And when you realize that, you know what, you never know when your time is going to be up. You've got to live your life the best of your ability. You've got to do what makes you happy. And you've got to do what fulfills you because you never know when it's going to be over. But you also need to make sure that you tell the people that you love that you love them today. Like, don't wait, not tomorrow today, because you never know what's going to happen. Nobody is guaranteed tomorrow. So do what you need to do because I would hate for you to basically regret not telling somebody that you love them, that you love them, or for you to pass away and for them not to know how amazing you think they are. Guys, and that's where I'm going to wrap things up. By telling you that I love you. I also want you to know that I think you're amazing and can accomplish anything. And I just also would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for being my friend for all these years. We don't know what tomorrow brings. I do know that 2025 is here. And hopefully you and I, we can make it the best year yet. Thank you. And the sooner you understand and learn the things that we talked about in today's video, the sooner you're going to kick ass in 2025. I love you guys. Be good."

        "transcript": " Alright, so check this out. The other day my friend calls me and he's super upset with me because he watched one of my videos where I said that an Apple Watch wasn't stylish and I'm like, why you made it me for telling you the truth? And so then we get into this big whole debate about, you know, Apple Watches and I'm like, look, they're the equivalent to Teslas for cars, right? If you're a car guy, you are never gonna rock a Tesla and if you are somebody that is stylish, you are never gonna rock an Apple Watch, period. And then I'm like, what do you care anyway? I'm a 48 year old dude rocking earrings, like seriously, take everything I'm about to say in today's video with a grain of salt, but I'm going over my list of some items that you should never wear in 2025. Number one is Air Force Ones. White Air Force Ones are the most over-hyped, overplayed, over-worn shoe of like 2024. And quite frankly, I'm sick of seeing them. I don't think they look that good. I also don't love the profile and if a 12 year old girl can wear them, you as an adult dude should not. A better option would be something like this, all right? It's still white, it's still leather, it's still casual sneaker. The brand is Axel Arigato. The style is called the Dice Low. It's still got that like white sneaker vibe, but just a more elevated aesthetic. Number two is actually fashion hats, all right? So here's the deal. Fedora's were like huge, 12 years ago. And then there was like that whole like kind of flat bill like cowboy style hat. I personally think that dudes that wear hats like this look like humongous. Speaking of douchey hats, right? You remember? Yeah, yeah, that whole like beanie like pulled back like, yo, I'm super cool. Nope, you're not. And if you're a dude that wears your beanies like rolled up like this, like come on, like really? Cross body bags. Little sick of them. How about you guys? Next thing I'm sick of saying is denim. Denim that's too tight. Stop it. Denim said sagging down off your booty. Stop it. Wear a belt or wear pants that actually fit. Jeans that are too big, too baggy, pulling and puddling down at the ankles. If they're overly distressed, no. If they're any color other than blue, black, gray, or in the summer, white, don't wear them. Fake leather and like save me the whole like I'm vegan. We know everybody knows you're a vegan if you're a vegan. It doesn't mean you can't wear a better option than fake leather. Fake leather sucks so bad. It's ridiculous. Whether it's jackets, it's sneakers, it's boots, dad shoes, like it's 2025. Finally, the year that dad shoes like kind of get the kibosh. I hope they do because they don't make you look sexy. Something else that makes you look like a dad and unstylish is ankle socks. All right. Ankle socks. Once again, like what's the point? They're terrible. If you're going to do a sock, go no show or go something a little bit more mid calf to be more aesthetic, more stylish. The ankle sock sucks. Tattoos. Stop with the tattoos. Like seriously, it's become an alarming trend. The amount of dudes and women and everybody that's just covering their sexy ass body and skin with tons of tattoos. And the tattoos mind you aren't that great. Most of them are pretty stupid. Don't have a meeting. People just think it's cool to get tattoos. I did do when I was young and I ended up getting a bumblebee on my back, a moon on my leg. Not very alpha. And even though right now you think, yo, I'm always going to love this squirrel coming up from my pants, holding two nuts, right? Because you're like, yeah, what's funny? It's awesome, right? You might not always think it's funny and awesome, which brings me to something else you got to stop wearing. And that is any t-shirt, any sock, anything with inappropriate language or something that's just stupid. Stop wearing stupid graphic t-shirts. Pointy shoes, pointy boots, boat shoes, dirty sneakers, dirty anything. Stop it. Stop it. You should know better by now. All right. Also, stop wearing jeans with like shiny shoes. Nothing makes you look like you've got zero style skill than if you're wearing jeans and shiny shoes trying to dress it up. Do better than that. All right. You also need to make sure that your leathers match if you're wearing dress shoes and a belt. All right. You can't have a belt that's all beat up and looking like shit either. All right. We talk about it a bunch. You are going to be wearing a belt. You got to make sure that you're a belt responsible, which means no big buckles. They're tacky. I also think that like the Gucci belts and the Hermes belts, all those are a little bit like, yo, look at me. Check me out. I spent way too much money on a belt. Like I think they're a little bit like showy and definitely not needed. All right. And some belts, like I've said, they are the best. You also need to make sure that if you are going to be wearing some type of designer or anything, it's not overly flashy. Do not wear clothes. It's like, Hey, hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Whether or not it's shoes, it's jeans, it's a t-shirt, it's a jacket, it's outerwear. You don't want brands or styles or items that basically are super like showy, loud and flashy. All right. You got to do better than that. That's for people that want attention. You get attention for being stylish, not for wearing something that's really loud, bright, big logos, big patterns that you're only going to be literally able to wear for two months. Dress shirts worn untucked. Don't do it. Period. Like dress shirts or dress shirts, they're meant to be tucked in. If you want to wear a button up untucked, they make button ups that are designed to be untucked. They're going to be shorter. You got to make sure it's not coming down too past your crotch. All right. Bottom line. You look stupid. You also, in my opinion, look stupid if you're wearing a button down collar with a tie with a suit. Don't do it. Speaking of suits, thin lapels. Don't do it. Thin ties. Don't do it. A lot of flash. A lot of bling for your suit. Take it easy, right? In terms of all the accoutrements that a suit should endure, basically, if you want to do cufflinks, that's cool. You want to do a white pocket square? That's cool. All the matching tie pocket square combos. Don't do it. Loser. Literally, it makes you look like a loser and like you have no idea that you shouldn't do that. Don't do it. If it's too matchy, matchy, it doesn't look good. All right. Some other things that don't look good is when you've just got like the pocket square, the lapel pin, the flower in the hole, like just a bunch of like suit crap. Don't do it. Simple, minimal, clean aesthetic. That should be the goal. Long shorts that come down past your knee. Stop it. Don't ever wear them again. Ever. Like ever. Also, basketball shorts. I think basketball shorts look stupid. And if you're not wearing underwear, you can see your wiener. Stop wearing shorts. You can see your wiener without underwear. Like period. At the gym or just out and about. Don't do it. It's ridiculous. If I can tell that you're circumcised or not. Something else that's ridiculous is under armor shirts, in my opinion. It doesn't matter if you're a jack rip stud. You look stupid. That goes for anything that's too tight. Stop wearing overly tight stuff. Whether or not it's t-shirts, it's sweaters, it's polo shirts, it's pants, it's suits. All right? If it looks like it's ready to rip off your body, whether or not you're muscular or you're just fat, stop wearing it. It's not good. It's not a good look. Period. So let's see. Who haven't I offended yet? Piercings. Let's talk about it. All right? If you're a dude and you're wearing earrings, it makes you look feminine. Just throwing it out there because it does. If you're a dude and you're wearing a bunch of faceful piercings, like in your lips or your nose, your eyebrows, you look trashy. Like period. Trashy. Stop it. Do better. Like seriously. Take the shit out. If you've got big gauges, like in your earlobes, also it doesn't necessarily make you look like sophisticated. I'm not saying you are trashy or you're not respectable. I'm just saying that people have the perception of people with a bunch of crap in their face or a bunch of tattoos all over the place as not as respectable or they're not as willing to give them a chance. And I want you to have every opportunity you can in this world. The next thing you got to stop doing though, in terms of opportunity with the spicy sanoritas is wearing jacked up underwear. All right? Big boxers, they're out. They've never been in for like years. They're just baggy horribleness. No support. No sexiness. They make your calves look super skinny. Wear boxer briefs or something a little tighter. But if they're holy, if they're white, if they're stained, get rid of them. If your armpits, right? And your white t-shirts are stained, get rid of it. Toss it. Dress shirts. Pits stains. Get rid of it. If you're wearing shirts tucked in and you got a big muffin top, size down, which brings me to the next lesson. Guys, you got to make sure you wear clothing that fits your body. Anything too big, too blousey, too baggy, get rid of it. This includes pants. If your pants are long, if they're puddling, if you got a big, huge, low rise in your crotch, is like downing your knees, get rid of it. Gentlemen, you are way too sexy to wear any of this."

        "transcript": " Tight skin fades are out. The modern mullet has been modified and the wolf is the new badass hairstyle on the block. What's up gentlemen and welcome to 2025. Today, I am gonna go over my list of the best hairstyles for men you're gonna see this year. Some of them are new that you haven't really heard of before. Others are old-school classics and some are just plain sexy. So first a few things you need to know about the hairstyles that are gonna be popular this year, alright? Low maintenance is key. Embracing your natural texture also one of the things that's gonna set this year apart from a lot of other years. You're also getting away from a lot of the high maintenance hairstyles. Guys are sick and tired of having to go in and get their sides tightened up every two to three weeks. It's expensive. It's also a pain in the ass. 2025 hairstyles are gonna look a lot more natural, alright? But it doesn't mean that there aren't any products. The two products you need to know about are one a sea salt spray. Sea salt spray is a must. It's gonna add separation. It's also gonna add some texture and volume to the styles to make them look better because that's one of the things. If you want your hairstyle to really pop, you need it not to be like super flat. The way that you solve that problem is sea salt spray after the shower, then either towel dryer, blow dryer hair, and then apply your product. Alright, that's what I did this morning, but you're like, yo, your hair sucks. It does because I haven't applied any other product, alright? The second product I want to talk about is a texturizing powder. This product is the new kid on the hair block. Everybody should try this product, alright? The way that it works, super simple, alright? All you do is sprinkle a little bit in your hair, work it in, right? And then you style any way you want. The amount of texture, the amount of volume is insane. This product is a must try. Guys, if you want to check out either of these products, I'm gonna link to them down below at Pete and Pedro. We also have a limited time discount code. The other cool thing with both of these products is they come in travel size. If you don't want to buy a big bottle, you want to try it out, that's fine. Same thing goes for the texturizing powder. We now offer a .33 ounce offering that's actually under $10. And with that discount code down below, guys, it makes it a huge hair, no brainer. Check it out, right? All I have in my hair is a little bit of sea salt spray and the texturizing powder. The volume, the natural feel, the natural look, guys. I'm telling you, if you haven't tried these products, you need to. They are definitely gonna change the game and make your hair look amazing, guys. Hit the link down below. Use that discount code because that code, it won't last. But what will are these styles this year? Number one is the wolf. Oh, baby, this one is gonna be big. Here's the deal. The wolf style is basically longer to medium length hair, right? You're basically just letting it grow, all right? The back is gonna get a little bit longer. It's almost like a longer grown out mullet. The sides, though, are also, instead of being tapered, are gonna grow out as well. It's a lot more natural. It's also very playful. It's basically a badass hairstyle that's pretty easy to do. And the cool thing with the wolf style is that it works for both guys with curly hair, wavy hair, or even straight hair. The wolf hairstyle is a medium to longer hairstyle. You're letting it grow out. It's kind of like the mullet that's just grown up and grown out. It's characterized by long, PC layers that are very choppy, which means there's gonna be a lot of texture and dimension in your hairstyle. All right, you're gonna have longer bangs. Typically, they're gonna be parted in the center. And then the back is also gonna grow out. The sides also are gonna be allowed to grow out, but typically, they're gonna be pushed back a little bit. Now, the key to this style, looking amazing, is A, getting an incredible cut. Do not just let all of your hair grow one length and think that that's gonna look great. You've gotta make sure that the stylus or barber gets in there and texturizes your hair. You also need to make sure you're using a pre-styler or something to add a little bit of volume and texture to that hair so it's not lifeless and flat. Number two is the tapered, messy fringe. All right, tapered sides basically just means you're gradually blending from short to a little bit longer. You're not gonna see the style as much with a tight fade, even a low fade. These are kind of going away a bit because guys are opting for more natural styles that aren't so high maintenance. The messy fringe is a great style if you're a younger dude. The tapered texture fringe is an amazing hairstyle for guys I would say under the age of 30. It's a more playful, youthful look. It's also ideal for guys that have a large forehead or a receding hairline because the messy fringe is basically gonna just be messy up top but pulled forward a little bit. You're gonna have some bangs. The bangs of the messy fringe are typically gonna be a little bit longer than the French crop, which we'll talk about a little bit later in this video. All right, once again, you gotta make sure you get a good hairstyle. You gotta make sure you've got texture, you've got layers, and then you're gonna wanna use some type of pre-styler like a sea salt spray and a texturizing powder to really give it some natural separation and that PC messy vibe that you're going for. Next up, number three is the flow, the bro flow. Hair that's a little bit longer, medium to medium long, but not overly long in the back like the wolf cut. All right, this style is typically gonna be pushback. It's also gonna be characterized by a lot of volume, a lot of messiness. It's not gonna look super polished or like super refined. It's a more playful, casual look, but it looks amazing for you guys out there that have nice facial features but also a great thick head of hair. If you're sort of thinning, I would definitely stay away from this hairstyle because as your hair a little bit later. But the bro flow, amazing. Once again, make sure that you use some type of pre-styler to really give it that separation and that dimension that you're looking for. Number four is the French crop. As opposed to the messy texture, the French crop is gonna be shorter in terms of the length of the hair but also the bangs. Once again, it is a great style for you guys out there that does have a little bit of thinning or a big forehead or a receding hairline. It's gonna have a lot of separation, a lot of texture. It's a playful style but the thing that characterizes this a bit differently than the messy fringe is that the sides are gonna be typically a little bit tighter. The French crop also looks best in my opinion with a low fade or a mid fade. All right, the difference is a low fade is basically just gonna be around the temple area. A mid fade is gonna come up a little bit higher. Either way, it's an amazingly sexy style that is relatively low maintenance. Next style only looks good on about 10% of guys and that is the buzz cut or crew cut. All right, if you wanna shave your head and go like super low maintenance, this style looks amazing on guys that have very strong prominent features. Very strong eyes, very strong nose, very strong chin, nice lips, all right? This style is not for the faint of heart. You gotta have a good looking face in order to really pull this off. But on the flip side, the crew cut is a little bit softer of an option that I think looks amazing. And typically it's gonna be a little bit longer on top. You're gonna have a little bit more hair. And a little bit more hair actually makes a big difference for softening the look. And it also once again is gonna look amazing if you've got a very strong facial structure or if you've got a nice beard and that's something else. If you are gonna do some type of like buzz cut or a crew cut, adding some strong facial hair really is a great way to balance your face, draw the eye down and make you look extra sexy. The side part is the next old money style that is absolute perfection. And you're gonna see it a bunch. And depending on how you rock it and how you choose to style it is really gonna depend on how it's gonna look. And that's one of the things. The side part has the most variations of any hairstyle out there. Because if you use something like a high shine pomade, really slick it over, it's gonna look more like old money like Clark Gable sexy. But you could also do it with a more playful natural look, which is gonna be a little bit more like 90s cool. Classic side part in my opinion is like one of the most perfect hairstyles out there. Because it really looks great on like any dude, any face shape. It doesn't matter if you've got a round face or something a little bit more square. The side part offers a little bit of softness because of the asymmetry of where the part is and the fact that you've got a little bit of fringe or bangs on the one side. You wanna push it back, get it off your face, it's totally cool. The next style is the slick back. The slick back hairstyle is great for guys that have medium to long hair. And in my opinion, it's just a very just mature and refined look. It looks great when you dress it up with a suit, but it also looks amazing in the summertime with a great pair of shades, a simple t-shirt and some shorts. When I think of the slick back, I think of Miami, right? Miami light colors, linens, right? You're on a yacht, slickin' that shit back, right? A pair of cool sunglasses, you're crushing it, all right? You gotta make sure you're using some type of high-hold product in order to have that hair stay and lock into place. And the sleeper style 2025, my prediction is flat tops. You're gonna see a lot more flat tops this year. Think Dolph Lundren in Rocky V, right? That big ass Russian with the blonde, yeah, that's a flat top. I think you're gonna see that a lot. It's an old school style that just has a very kind of military inspired vibe. And I think that guys are really gravitating in trying some of these old school fresh styles, just reinventing them, reinvigorating them and making them their own this year. Guys, that's it. My list for the best hairstyles in 2025."

        "transcript": " Oh my God, I never saw this coming! Said every woman that was married to a dude who had a midlife crisis. Today guys, I want to explore the topic and concept of the male midlife crisis. We're going to talk about and analyze what it is, why it happens, but then, most importantly, at the end of the video, I'm going to go over some actionable steps that you can take in order to never have one. So most people think of midlife crisis, what comes to mind. Probably a dude in his 40s or 50s who goes and bangs his 28 year old secretary, he leaves his wife and kids, and then he goes and buys a Ferrari. Most people attribute it to some like, realization that a man has at that point in his life, like, oh my God, I'm going to die someday. Personally, I think this is complete bullshit and an easy way out. I think it's much deeper than that. Truly, I feel like it's an identity crisis or an identity issue, or the fact that this dude has been living his life for somebody else, something else, for his entire life. And then one day he wakes up and he's like, you know what? I am missing passion. I am missing excitement. I am missing goals. And I'm going to go out and get that burning fire. I want something that's going to make me feel alive again. And most people that are close to this dude, they never see it coming, right? It's always like, oh my God, it's such a shock. Is it? I don't think it's a shock. I don't think it's a shock at all. Which brings me to the second part of this video. Why does it happen? Is it because guys get in their 50s or 40s and they're like, oh my God, I'm going to die? I think that's ridiculous. I don't think it's that at all. I think that men, women, all of us are more aware of the fact that life is short as we age. You know, as you get into your 30s, your 40s, your 50s, your 60s, you're going to see more people around you passing away. You're going to have more issues with your body. But I personally don't feel like that is the reason why men all of a sudden go crazy, go sleep with their secretary, buy a Lambo, and leave their wife and kids. I don't think that's it at all. What I think is happening is much deeper than that. And it starts a lot sooner. It starts earlier. You know, unfortunately, a lot of men live a life that they are not passionate about. Now, the term passion gets tossed out there like crazy, right? I want to be passionate about that. You know, you can have a passion for something, but when I talk about living a passionate life, it means a life that is fun, that's exciting. It doesn't mean that every day is like roses and BJs, but you get what I'm saying. Overall, you are doing things and striving to live an incredibly fun, productive, exciting, purpose-driven life. But a lot of men, they don't. Their life, it feels empty. It feels like they are on that treadmill. They're doing the same thing day in and day out. Maybe they're living a life for somebody else. Maybe they didn't follow their purpose or their passion when they were young. They listened to other people. Maybe their parents. Maybe their girlfriend. Maybe their boyfriend. Maybe whoever. And said, no, no, no. You don't want to do that. You want to do this. This is what a responsible person does. He goes to college. He gets a degree. He marries a beautiful woman. He has 2.5 kids. And then he gets a job that offers him a nice 401K. He has a few vacation weeks a year. Disney. He gets to go to Disney, which sounds horrible to me, right? He's living a life that somebody else wants. He does what is expected. And once he gets married, once he has kids, once he has these responsibilities, he can't take a shot. He can't do what he wants. He's got responsibilities. And these responsibilities a lot of times are what hold us back. But one day he's like, fuck it. I want to be excited. I want to be invigorated. I want to live an amazing life. It's not about getting ready to die. It's about not doing boring shit and living a life that just isn't fun. And like I said, it doesn't mean that every day is going to be an amazing adventure. But it doesn't mean that you can't live a life that is true to who you are. And really, I feel like that is what it is. In my opinion, when a man has a midlife crisis and he makes a 180 turn and does something different or what is out of the norm or expected of him, it's not because he's getting ready to die. It's because he wants to live an exciting, inspired life. And for too long, he was living and doing things for other people. And he decides to finally be selfish when the solution and the fix is to be selfish from the fucking beginning. Unfortunately, the term being selfish is kind of negative, right? You don't want to be selfish. You want to be giving. Well, when it comes to you, your life and what you want, if you're not selfish, you are probably going to be one of these dudes that one day is like, uh-oh, time to go. I'm going to Burning Man. I started listening to Joe Rogan. I'm going to start micro dosing, right? And all of a sudden, everybody's like, oh my God, I never saw it coming when you should have been selfish from the fucking start. Period. Which brings me to the third part of this video. How do you avoid it? How do we avoid this destructive midlife crisis? Because it's not destructive to you, but a lot of the people in your life, it's collateral damage of you finally manning up, being selfish and doing what's in your heart, right? How do you stop it? Number one, don't get married too early. All right. And I'm just going to throw that out there. I think one of the problems is some men get married too early because they're rushing into it because of the pressure from the person or their parents or their family or their church or wherever. You know, you don't know yourself when you're in your 20s. 30s, you're just learning. And 40s, you're still figuring it out. I'm a firm believer that nobody should get married or even consider it before your 30. You got to start exploring and experimenting and kicking some tires. And what I mean by that is dating a few different people, right? Because if you just fall into the trap of you meet somebody and then you marry them because it's expected or you feel like, you know what, that's probably the one that I should be with and oh my God, right? One of the other reasons why a lot of guys, I feel like, start having affairs is because they're curious. They're curious of what's out there. They're curious if they've still got it and they want to see what they can get. And plus sex is fun. It's exciting. It's exhilarating. It's why we as men do a lot of the things, right? It's the get action. When the truth is that if you get action when you're younger and I'm not saying to go whore around and be a slut, but getting married too soon, I think is one of the reasons why a lot of guys fall into this trap of doing what is expected as opposed to what is something that they want to do, all right? The second thing is don't listen to anybody else when it comes to what you want to do with your life. If you want to be a rocket scientist, do it. If you want to be a traveling musician, do it. If you want to be a painter, if you want to be an artist, if you want to be an entrepreneur, do it. Do not fall prey to other people's opinions or expectations of what you should do with your life. The third part of never having a midlife crisis according to Alpha M is you got to consistently and constantly be striving for something more or better. It doesn't mean that you can't be satisfied or happy with what you've achieved, but when you stop trying, when you stop striving, when you stop having those goals that you're going after, your life stops having as much meaning. And it gets boring, it gets monotonous, you're doing the same thing each and every day. And this is another reason why I feel like so many guys basically had this midlife crisis, is that they stopped having goals. They have their family, they've got their kids, they've got their weekend at Disney once a year, like, okay, right? And then they're like, yo, I'm going, I want a sports car and I want some spicy-sitting Rita to give me a BJ while I'm driving. This is awesome! You've got goals. When you've got something that you're striving for, whether or not it's financially or a business professionally or a vacation, a new car, a new house, like, whatever, it doesn't matter what it is. And it doesn't matter if somebody doesn't agree with what you want. When you've got goals, it basically gives you a direction and it gives you something to work towards. Even if it's not easy, it actually shouldn't be easy because if it's easy, it probably wasn't that good of a goal. But you've got to have something you're working towards and striving in order to keep the fire, the excitement. Number four, you've got to keep your relationship alive. What I mean by that is you've got to make time for the two of you. One of the problems that happens is that people get comfortable, people get in relationships for a long time, and they stop trying. She lets her body go. She stops giving you BJs while you're driving your Ferrari. You get fat. You get lazy. You stop trying. You stop telling her that she's spicy and sassy and doing the things you need to do in order to satisfy her like going downtown to visit Brenda. You've got to keep putting in the time, the energy in your relationship. It takes two people though. It can't be just you and she decides just to be a pig and not ever take care of herself and not give you BJs while you're driving your Ferrari. She can't do that. It takes two people, but it also takes you taking responsibility of yourself, which brings me to the next thing you need to do. Number five is take care of yourself physically, including your skin, including your body, including like shaving your balls. Like don't not shave your balls and don't not use Pete and Pedro ball powder. You've got to take care of yourself physically. You've got to keep dressing well. You've got to keep working out. You've got to keep not getting man boobs and sloppy fat. You've got to exercise. If you beautiful things happen, you feel good about yourself, you look good, and you also just have higher self-esteem. Because once again, when you start to age, when you start to get into that rut or you're living that boring life, a lot of bad things happen. And because you're not taking care of yourself, your self-esteem isn't really great. You start looking and seeking it in other validating ways, whether or not it's that spicy Senorita who's working the front desk in accounting or a Lambo or something. These things are not going to solve your problem. The other truth is that even if you do go out and bang that spicy Senorita by that Lambo, get those BJs in the car while you're driving, you're not going to be happy. You might be happy temporarily, but it's not going to lead to a fulfilled life. Because you're trying to satisfy something that only you can satisfy by being and living the life that you need now. And the other reality is that even though momentarily or temporarily you might get a little boost of endorphins and be excited, and it's exciting, you're going to realize that the spicy Senorita, Brenda, oh yeah, she's crazy, she's got a whole shit ton of baggage she's bringing to the table. She's probably also got a crazy ex-boyfriend who's going to come and want to beat your ass. The car, those exotic cars, they break down a lot, super expensive when you have to fix them. And those BJs from that spicy Senorita, they will stop. But what won't stop is you thinking back to the person in the family that you left that was by your side through thick and thin. You're probably going to regret the actions that you've taken, which is then going to lead to other issues. The bottom line is this, the midlife crisis does it happen? Yes, it happens, but I feel like it's a cop out. It's also your fault if it happens. If you live an inspired life that is purpose driven, you're never going to have to worry about that. If you live and do the things that you need to do now and do the things that are going to fulfill you and make you happy and continue to strive and have goals, you never, literally never have to worry about having a midlife crisis."

        "transcript": " Have you noticed that social media is literally flooded with hyper-sexualized content? And it feels at times that it's impossible to avoid. Whether or not it's Instagram or TikTok, it is always being jammed down our throat. Why? Well, I feel like there's one main reason, and that's only fans. Gentlemen, today we're going to explore what this means for men. We're going to dive a little bit deeper into this unfortunate trend that's affecting and reshaping relationships, mental health, not to mention how we as men spend our money. But I'm also going to share with you some tips and strategies to regain control of your life, your mindset, not to mention your algorithm. So, step number one, you got to understand why this has happened. Because in the old days, it's not like porn hasn't been there. It's been there forever. But in the old days, it was harder to get access. When I was a kid, just a little FYI, if I wanted to do something nasty to big Al, I had to go and actually work for it. And I would just riple through your step dads drawers in order to find dirty stuff that he had. Or maybe you were lucky and you got some Fredrick's of Hollywood or Victoria's Secret catalog in the mail. Or maybe you'd have to go to a dirty bookstore. Yeah, there were bookstores specifically designed to sell you magazines or videos. Or some gas stations that were a little sketchy. By the counter, you'd see a magazine rack. And then all of a sudden, you'd see the extra sexy section that had plastic over the magazines. And you're like, wow, right? And you try to sneak a peek. Gentlemen, the fact is it was hard to access. But then in the 90s, 2000s, the internet's meteoric rise changed everything. It wasn't like everywhere at this point. You'd have websites like something like consumption junction or some of these other like kind of sketchy dirty websites, right? You'd go, the videos were really bad quality. It was small little pixelated images. The experience wasn't that great, but you didn't have to go to the dirty bookstore and look like a huge purr. But then social media started to explode, right? You had sites like MySpace, sites like Facebook, all right? For you guys that like remember, Facebook started by Mark Zuckerberg to basically rate hot chicks at Harvard. All right, that's how it started, right? It was all about like this sexualization. But then it was about connections and all that nonsense. But MySpace, another example, there were a lot of people that were starting to dress and expose a lot more of themselves or be more provocative to get more attention because this was one of the things that changed attention. We now live in the attention economy where if you can get somebody to watch your stuff or look at you, you're probably going to be able to monetize it in some way. And then combine that with the fact that everybody now has literally like a supercomputer in their pocket and access to porn or social media at their fingertips. This changed everything. And then 2016 Onlyfans was launched. All right. Onlyfans, in my opinion, is the reason why things have gotten so insane and out of hand. All right. Because it finally allowed people to basically monetize their bodies and monetize their audience. And this, in my opinion, is the reason why you're seeing so much sexual content pretty much everywhere. Onlyf changed the game. All right. In the old days, right? 30 websites were there and everybody was looking at them and whatever, whatever. And now all of a sudden it put content and control into the OF creators hands. It also made it a more personalized experience. And therein lies the problem and the reason why we have seen that website explode. All right. Because it's helping and allowing people to have parasocial relationships with the creator that's getting naked or showing you whatever they want to show you. And it's these parasocial relationships that many men find like emotional fulfillment and happiness in, which is why it is exploding and getting worse. And then combine that with the fact that now the algorithm is basically jamming this hypersexualized content down everybody's throat because there's more content that's being put out there because all of these people want you to come and pay them for having that personalized experience. The algorithm, right? These algorithms that these platforms are putting out and that they've created is basically rewarding content that gets engagement that gets you to basically scroll and stop and chill out for a second. All right. It knows, Hey, if I show more of this, I'm going to get more exposure. You're going to keep scrolling longer. You're going to be on the platform longer. And with these platforms, it's all about that attention. That is the economy that we're living in. And so whatever they need to do in order to keep your attention, keep you scrolling, keep you engaging, keep you liking, keep you on their platform, they're going to keep doing it. Look, the more they post, the more they post, the more you look. The hypersexualized content preys on male insecurities, not to mention the loneliness that a lot of men are feeling. And this is and has caused the rise of OF. It's why it's been so wildly successful. Now we don't have to go out, right? We can stay at home. We can stay on our computers. We can engage with these people that are giving us attention as long as we give them a little money. The creators on that platform make on average around $200 a month. Not that bad, right? But a lot of people are making literally millions of dollars a year from simply that parasocial relationship that they're creating and facilitating with lonely single men. In my opinion, OF is a dangerous platform. And the repercussions are real. And unfortunately, I think it's going to basically lead to a lot of other platforms very similar to that one. And the reason why it's so dangerous in my opinion, well, there are a few reasons. All right. Number one is financially. All right. You shouldn't be spending your money that way. All right. There's a lot of free stuff online, but it's because you feel like you've got that connection because you like know that person. You're simping actually, if I'm being honest, right? It's a whole simp mentality. It's somebody who is paying for the attention, paying for the affection, thinking that they're going to get something in return, right? It's a very transactional relationship. All right. The other thing that's bad is mentally what it does to you. It basically has been proven that if you're exposed to a lot of sexual content, it basically desensitizes your brain. It also paints an unrealistic expectation and makes you less satisfied with the relations and interactions that you actually have with real people. And the third reason is dopamine, right? Over exposure to this type of content basically is causing us not to produce dopamine the way that we are intended to produce it. The main thing is that chemical in our brain that basically is produced in order for us to go out. In the old days, it was like to hunt like lions and cheetahs and drag them back to our spicy cave senorita, right? To feed our family. Now, right? We can get it simply by going on our phones, scrolling a little bit. We get little boosts and bumps, a dopamine. And honestly, it's synthetic. We're getting it in a nonproductive manner, which is then going to prevent us from making it or wanting to go out and actually do hard shit, which is the reward. Why you want to go out and do a hard shit because you feel good when you're done. And the fourth reason is self respect. You feel bad about yourself. Whether or not you admit it or not, you do. All right? Because I don't know anybody that admits to actually being on OnlyFans. I literally don't know anybody that admits to paying people. But this one woman, like I think it's Sophia Rain, she reportedly made $43 million last year. She said that one dude spent $4.7 million. Guys, like seriously, seriously, I'm talking like, it's that whole simp culture. It's this desperation. Guys, you're a man. You're amazing. You've got to break the cycle. You also need to break the algorithm because unfortunately, you know, the way that it works, you know how it works, right? You watch one thing. You look at one picture. You slow down while you're scrolling. Boom. All of a sudden, the algorithms got you and it keeps feeding you this hyper sexualized content. And so a few things I'd like to basically share with you that you can do. Number one is detox. You've got to stop consuming the social media as much as you are. Whether or not that means removing the app from your phone or the platform that you basically have a propensity to go to, remove it from your phone. All right? For me, just a little tip. All right? I was going to Facebook. All right? Just like out of boredom, I'd hit Facebook and just look, right? Because it was on my home screen on my phone. And so what I did was I didn't remove it from my phone. I just removed it from the home screen. This is my home screen. All right? Notice. No Instagram, no TikTok, no Facebook. And what happened was when I got it off of the home screen, because before it was on the home screen or every time I'd open my phone, it was there, I'd click it. I'd look. If I'm in line at Starbucks, I'd click it just to look. It was out of boredom. All right? So I removed it from the home screen and basically buried it down in the apps. I forgot about it. I might go there once a day, but it's not five, seven, ten times a day. Number two is manage your preferences. All right? You can tell the algorithm on the various platforms to not show you different types of content. All right? You can say, hey, I'm not interested in this. It's got to learn you, but you've got to be disciplined. You've got to be diligent because if you say, I don't want to see this. And then an hour later, the next day you're like, yo, I'm surfing and I'm doing all the stuff I shouldn't be or looking at that stuff that you don't want to look at, your algorithm is going to be like, yeah, right, Billy. Here's some more. Take some of this. And you're going to be like, no, don't recommend, right? You got to break this cycle. Start engaging in real world activities. Get out from the computer screen. You got to get out there. You got to get active. You're going to have and cultivate new hobbies. You're also going to meet new people. The next tip is invest in your fitness. This is one of those things that's going to help you be better. It's also going to build and strengthen your mind. Focus on personal growth. All the time and energy you are spending surfing or looking at social media, start investing it in yourself. Maybe join an educational platform like Skillshare or read books or listen to audio books or go to workshops, invest in yourself, build yourself up. And the last tip is build and cultivate better relationships. All right. The parasocial relationship that you have with somebody online that you actually don't interact with personally is one that's going to leave you longing for more. It's also going to trick your brain into thinking you have friends or you've got a relationship with somebody. Spend more time with friends and loved ones. Go do things. Guys, being online is one of those things that is dangerous in my opinion. Not only what it does to your brain, but it also prevents you from living your life. You've got to start exploring. You've got to go for it. You've got to get out behind the screen. It's okay to leave your phone at home. It's okay to go out for a walk and not be looking at your phone. Guys, you've got to break the cycle because unfortunately it's not getting any better. And because of the rise of OF, I feel like it's going to get worse. You've just got to focus on you. Be the best version of yourself you can and everything else. Don't worry about."

        "transcript": " All right sweetie so how many times have you had skin cancer now? Four. Four times. What is a sign or symptom that you noticed that somebody could look for? Um, there will be a spot there. It will look irregular. It may be like risen and kind of almost like flaky on the top or it might be, have a weird color. But yours were like kind of crusty and it just like would bleed right? And it like when washing my face, it was just washing it would make it bleed so the top of it was thin. Okay. Yeah, that's basically what I've experienced. Guys, here's the deal. Your body will give you warning signs when something is not right. Today I want to go over some things that you need to pay attention to. They're basically letting you know, you know what? Something's not right and you are not healthy. Think of these things that we're going to go over today. It's kind of like your body's check engine light. If it's going on with you, there is a problem and you should not ignore it. And that's one of the things that unfortunately we as dumb dudes do. We'll have something come up. We'll be like, yeah, whatever, it'll be fine. Sometimes it's fine, but sometimes it's not whatever it's fine. And it ends up becoming a bigger issue when if you just identify it early and catch it, you can fix it. All right. So the first thing we're going to talk about is skin cancer. All right. Real quick, it's on the mind because my wife literally just got diagnosed with it again. All right. If you have any type of irregularity, right, you've got a little spot that looks a little bit different. Maybe the borders are a little bit irregular. If it's a mole or if it's a hard place and you pick it and it bleeds and it just never seems to go away. Go to a dermatologist, get it checked out, get it biopsied. Number two is actually number two, the deuce. All right. And this is one of those things that it's going to let you know what's going on with you a lot of times. All right. If you're not going on a regular basis like every day, at least once, there's a problem. Constipation isn't normal. You got to figure it out. Whether or not it's you're not eating enough fiber, you're dehydrated, you got to figure it out. Because if you don't deuce it on a regular basis, you could potentially develop some type of issue like whole rectal cancer, which is definitely not fun. You're gassy if you're bloated, if you're super like liquidy in terms of your deuses, also not normal. Once in a while, fine. But if it's a persistent thing, you got to go figure out what's going on. If it's bloody, if you wipe and you're like, yo, there's blood or there's blood in the toilet. Also, assign yo, Billy, something's not right down in the butt. Eyes, gentlemen. If your eyes are yellow, the whites of your eyes, not normal. It couldn't mean a liver issue. Go get it checked. If your eyes are red or bloodshot, this could mean that you've got allergies. Or if it's persistent, it could mean that you've got high blood pressure or an issue you've got to deal with. High blood pressure is nothing to fuck with. Dark circles, also not normal. All right, why? Is it because you're not getting enough sleep? Or are you having some type of vitamin or mineral deficiency? Nails. If your nails are thick, discolored, yellow, green, not normal. If they're wavier, rigid, if they've got like white specks in them, not normal. And this also goes for your toenails. Guys, you got to figure out what's going on. It could mean it's a vitamin deficiency, but it could also mean it's a fungus or something more serious. Bad breath. That was creepy. All right, it's nasty, too, if you got bad breath, all right? Bad breath is a sign something's going on. Once in a while, a big deal. But if it's persistent, this could mean something as serious as like stomach cancer, or it could be something like acid reflux. Acid reflux is also not normal and something else you got to pay attention to. If you are having heartburn or indigestion, once again, not normal. Why is it going on? If left untreated, it can become a more serious issue like esophageal cancer. Also, your breath, is it because your gums are nasty? If you brush your teeth and you spit and there's blood? I'm not talking about a little blood once in a while, like after you floss or after you brush your teeth. But if it's like serious blood and it's on a regular basis, this is a sign something's going on. Whether or not you've got gingivitis or something more serious. If your tongue is white, also not normal. Thrush. Have you guys heard of thrush? It's basically like a yeast infection in your mouth. Exactly. Sounds sexy. It's not. It's also not good. Your balls, if they're big and swollen all of a sudden, not normal. If one is bigger than the other, oh my god, that's actually normal. Don't freak out. You should, however, get into the habit of giving yourself a little routine exam down there, right? Feel them, squeeze them, touch them a little bit, right? In the shower is the ideal time. In the shower, just roll them around. Feel them, right? It's important that you get familiar with the way that your testicles feel, honestly. And the reason is because if you notice something like one gets harder or there's pain down there, not normal, go get a check quickly because it could be something serious like torsion, which is definitely not something you want to mess with. But if you're rolling it around and you're feeling it and you feel some type of like bump or some type of like irregularity, this isn't normal. Go get it checked, all right? And this could mean something simple like you've got an infection, but it also could be something more serious like testicular cancer. Gentlemen, feel, yo, nuts. Next up, we got to talk about your skin because your skin will tell you a lot about what's going on with your body and how healthy you are. If your skin is glowing, if it's radiant, if it's healthy looking, that's a sign that everything's probably good, but you need to make sure that you keep it looking that way, which is why skincare routine, which is something I talk about all the time, is very important. But if you've got blemishes, all right? If you've got acne, if you've got blackheads, if your skin is super oily or if it's dry, if it's dull, if it's wrinkled, if it's crusty, if it's cracked, guys, do something about it. Guys, T-Shandley is what I personally use and what I would recommend. If you want to basically have incredible skin and fix anything that's going on with it, not to mention look great for years, but the truth is whether or not you use T-Shandley or some other higher price, lower quality product, I don't care. I just want you to start taking better care of your skin. Few basic things you need to do. Wash your face twice a day to remove the oil that dirt the grime. Twice a week exfoliate to remove the top dead layer of skin and keep those pores open and bring new fresh skin to the surface. And then twice a day, you need to moisturize. In the morning before you leave the house, you need to use a moisturizer with an SPF of 20. The SPF is important to protect your skin from the sun's harmful damage so that you don't get skin cancer. Guys, I'm telling you, it's deadly serious that you protect your face every day. Even if you don't think, oh, I'm not going to be out in the sun, it doesn't matter. Then at night before you go to bed, boom, a PM moisturizer is going to help your face heal so that when you wake up, it's going to be radiating, handsome, sexy, and moisturized. You also need to make sure you're hydrating. Drinking enough water is a critical component to having amazing skin, eating healthy. Another bonus in terms of looking amazing. If you're eating a diet that's high in shit food, high in saturated nonsense, high in sugar, your skin is going to reflect it. Not to mention your man boobs, which we'll talk about in a second, because if you have them, it's not normal. Actually, it's normal, but it's not good and you're not healthy if you do, which I'll talk about in a second. Guys, real quick, real talk, this is the best in the business period. You got a few amazing products, a few simple steps, a routine that you do every day, morning and night to have amazing skin. And right now, I've got an amazing deal for you. You guys go through my special link down below, all right? You got to go through my link in order to get this. You're going to get 40% off your first system. You're also going to get a $20 free gift while supplies last. Plus, you're also going to get 20% off for life. Yes, you heard that correct. For those of you who go through my link and get started today, guys, bottom line is this. If you want to have amazing skin, it's easy. It's possible, but it starts with you taking action. The action I want you to take is T's Handley. The sooner you start, the better you're going to look, and the less you're going to have to deal with these issues that we talked about. Guys, the fact is, if you want to look amazing, you can T's Handley gets it done. Boobies, we got to talk about man boobies. If you've got gynecomastia, which is a hard knot behind your nipple, not normal. It means you've got a hormonal imbalance. Something's going on. Whether or not your estrogen's too high, your testosterone's out of whack, you got to figure out why. Or if you've got fat titties, which is what I call basically the other kind of man boobs. And this is not a medical condition. It's just you being lazy and honestly eating not good and not exercising as much as you should. Fat titties are super preventable. It takes you, take an accident, it takes you, eating better, going to the gym, bottom line. Period. Lose weight. Now, something else. If you can't lose weight, not normal. What's going on? Is it a hormonal thing or is it something else? Or if you're losing weight like super quick and you don't know why, you're like, damn, I'm like losing like 20 pounds and I didn't really change anything. Also not normal. Go get it checked out. If you also are having a difficult time putting on muscle mass, not normal. It could mean that your testosterone level is too low. Or if you're losing muscle mass, testosterone could be low. If you're working out, right? And you're having a difficult time putting on muscle mass or you notice that your muscles are getting smaller and you're still working out, this is a sign that you got something going on. Typically it's going to be hormonal because after the age of 30, our testosterone level as men starts to drop at about 1% per year. And recently I read that it's basically dropping faster than that. But the good news is there are things you can do in order to reverse it, stop it naturally. Not the TRT route because unfortunately that is something else that really bothers me. A lot of guys jump on that when they really just need to modify their lifestyle. They need to eat better, higher quality food and they need to exercise and take their supplements. And that's it, right? And your testosterone level typically will come back or get better or not drop as fast. Something else is big out. Is he hard? If he isn't, that's not normal. If you never want to get him hard, not normal. If when you do get him hard and he's like kind of like crooked or looks bent, that could be a sign of something more serious like you had an injury or you've got something like Peroni's disease. Go get it checked, go get it figured out because once again, not normal. If when you have the big, oh, oh, oh, oh, mama, if the semen volume is smaller than it used to be, not normal. Typically that's going to mean that your testosterone level is dropping. Something else that means it's dropping is if your balls get small. Teeny, tiny balls are a sign of A. Your testosterone level is too high because you're taking something like TRT or some type of performance enhancing drugs and your body's like, yo, I don't need to make it. And so your balls are going to shut down and get small or they're shrinking because of your testosterone level has dropped. Guys, small, teeny, tiny balls, not normal. Pale lips, cracked lips, not normal. Cold hands, cold feet. This we're talking circulation issues. Ow, got a muscle cramp. Wait, just that's not that's not a cramp that I'm having. But if you're having them, not normal. It's an issue. If you're waking up with Charlie horses or cramps and muscles or spasms, this is a sign that something's off. A lot of times it could be something like a mineral deficiency or your sodium is too low or your potassium is out of whack. But the bottom line is you've got to figure out why because it's not normal. Also, if your ankles or legs swell by the end of the day, not normal. This is a problem. Itchy. Are you constantly not normal? It could be that you've got dry skin because of the seasonality or because you're taking showers that are too hot and it's drying you out. But it could also mean you've got some type of kidney issue or liver issue. Guys, always being itchy isn't normal. All right, dandruff also not normal. If you've got a bunch of dandruff or dry scalp, which a lot of guys think I've got dry scalp. You don't have dry scalp. You've got dandruff. If you're somebody that does have dandruff, this means that you have some type of issue going on with your scalp. And a lot of times it's caused by, well, there are a few different reasons why dandruff happens, but it could literally be a fungus. It could be a bacteria. It could be a lot of things, but it's definitely not normal. Something else that's not normal is hair loss. Whether or not it's on your head, on your body, on your beard, on your legs, in your pubes, if you are seeing a reduction in the density of hair, this is a sign that something's going on. And a lot of times it is hormonal. All right, if you have balding up top, right, this also could be your testosterone level is really high and it's converting to DHT, which is basically causing your hair to fall out, but it could also be something else like a mineral deficiency, a vitamin deficiency. And the last thing I just want to talk about is sweating. If you are somebody that is excessively sweating, once again, this isn't normal. You've got to figure out why. Whether or not it's your hands or it's your pits or it's your overall body, excessive sweating isn't necessarily normal. And it's something to definitely go talk to a doctor or a dermatologist about. Guys, the fact is your body is absolutely fucking amazing and it will let you know, yo, something's going on, but it's up to you to be smart enough as a dude to identify these things and then go get it checked out. The other thing I'd just like to recommend is go get blood work done. Personally, I would recommend every single one of you regardless of your 20 or if you're 55 to go get blood work done. Go get your testosterone level checked. You got to ask for it. They're not going to automatically do it with a physical typically and then get blood work done, get a full panel just so that you know what's going on. It's going to show you what your liver function is. It's going to show you where everything is, your cholesterol, good, bad, like all the stuff, right? You got to know your numbers. If you don't know your numbers and then when something's going on, you go and get it checked. You're not going to go and be able to see how it shifted or how it changed. And one more thing I just want to mention because I just thought of it is if you're peeing a lot, all right, more than normal and you're like not like increasing the amount of water that you're drinking. This is science. Something else could be going on with your prostate. The other reason why a blood test is amazing is it's going to tell you where your PSA level is and then over time you're going to be able to see what happens. You don't need to have the old finger in the bum in order to get your prostate checked like in the old days. Now they do it with a simple blood test and that PSA level is something to keep an eye on. If you see it starts to spike, right, then you got to deal with it, address it before it becomes a bigger issue. A lot of things that we talked about and a lot of the issues that you're going to have as you age are preventable or I should say they're treatable as long as you identify them early before it becomes a bigger issue. Guys, I love you. I think you're amazing. Now go get healthy."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, come here. Go ahead, give it a sniff. What do you think? Yeah? You smell that? That's a man. That's what a man smells like. Today guys, I'm going over some fragrances that literally make you smell like a teenager. All right, but I'm also gonna give you some alternatives to the fragrances that I mentioned so that you know what to wear to smell sexy as hell. Number one is body sprays. Specifically acts, but there are other ones on the market that make you literally smell like a teenager. All right, grown ass men don't wear body sprays. Two super affordable alternatives to like an ax body spray is this one, Nautica Voyage, I think it smells incredible. It is very synthetic, but it's a lot better than the ax and the body sprays that you're gonna find. Something else I'd recommend is this Mont Blanc individual. It's also super affordable. And in my opinion, it still smells super great. Number two is Versace Eros, all right? Yes, it smells good, but the problem with this is it's overused by a lot of young dudes. All right, cause it is very affordable. Instead of what I'd recommend is something like Dior Home Intense, super sexy light fragrance that you're gonna love. Another option is Aquidijoux Performo. This also is another amazing lighter fresh fragrance, but in my opinion, it's just a little more grown up. And the third fragrance is Creed's Milicine Imperial. Now this one unfortunately is from the Creed house, and so it is gonna be around 450 bucks a bottle, but if you wanna smell that good for under 50 guys, you could try Icon. It is from Pete and Pedro, and this is gonna be $50, but with that discount code down below, it's actually less than that, a lot less. Number three is Paco Robano, $1 million, all right? This one, once again, is overused by young dudes. A lot of young dudes are rocking this stuff. I think it's loud and super sweet and just not that good. It makes you smell just like a young dude, right? Instead, I'd go with something like Victor and Ralph's Spice Bomb Extreme. Gucci Guilty Absolute is another great alternative to $1 million, and then Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille, all right? Tobacco Vanille is gonna be a little bit more masculine, but if you're somebody that does like that spicy fragrance, I would definitely check that out. Number four is CK1. CK1, in my opinion, is nostalgic for me, right? Because when I was younger, this stuff was super popular. It's been around for a long time, but with men and women, we're wearing it like crazy when it came out. If you're still wearing it, you stink. Instead, what I'd recommend is Creed Silver Mountain Water, a much better, fresher version, and also a little bit more mature. Mont Blanc Legend, a better option, and I know, I know, I shouldn't say it. I'm gonna say it though, you're Savage, all right? Savage, I think it does smell good, and I think it's a better alternative to CK1, which brings me to number five, which is Savage. Savage, here's the deal. Once again, it's about mass appeal. A lot of dudes are wearing it. Yes, it smells incredible, but that's one of the problems. A lot of guys are wearing it. A better alternative, if you're looking for a fragrance, that is going to basically get the compliments, but isn't going to basically be worn by literally every single young dude. Greenly by Perfumes, the Marley smells incredible. It's also light and fresh. Another one that I absolutely love is by Roja, and it's called Elysium. If you guys smelled Elysium, that one also smells incredible. Peanbeja Rebel, also another amazing alternative to Savage. This is actually heavily inspired by Creed of Anthos, so if you like this, you're gonna love this, because instead of 450 bucks, this once again is under $50 with that discount code down below. Rebel is our number one best-selling fragrance, and it's not just my opinion, this stuff is amazing. Go read the reviews. I'm gonna link to all the Peanbeja fragrances down below, and just so you know, all the fragrances come in the deluxe sample sizes, right? So if you're somebody that isn't ready to pull the trigger on a big bottle, you can buy them individually, but you can also buy them as a set. And this one has a little atomizer on it, guys. I'm telling you, it's an incredibly easy way to try out a few different fragrances without breaking the bank. Guys, hit the link down below. There is a special discount code for a limited time. Next up is Cool Water. Cool Water is also very sentimental to me, because when I first smelled it, I was like, this is literally the sexiest smelling fragrance ever. And then everybody wore it. And to this day, it's one of the most popular fragrances out there. Yes, it smells incredible, but everybody smelled it, which is why it's important to find something else. A better fragrance option is Creed Viking. If you guys haven't smelled Prada's Luna Rosa Carbon, you should, because it's incredible. It's not overused, and it's definitely fresh, sexy, and you guys are gonna smell incredible. Or Versace Pour Home. You can't go wrong with that classic fragrance. Next up is Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Pour Home. This one is synonymous with young dudes. It's your first designer sexy fragrance, and you're still rocking it. Unfortunately, I think it is gone in terms of its day. It's time to do something a little bit better. Something I'd recommend, once again, is Acre de Jo Performo. If you are somebody that loves that fresh, light, classic scent, this is just a better option, and a little bit more adult and grown up. And since you're somebody that likes a citrusy scent, you probably also wanna check out Versace Pour Home. That is something that is nautical, it's citrusy, and it's still amazing. A few fragrances that, in my opinion, are just done in terms of mature, sexy dudes, rocking them today. All right, John Paul Gauthier LaMail, I think, is time to go. Chrome, one of those fragrances. Yes, it smells incredible. When I first smelled Chrome, again, it was like cool water for me. I'm like, damn, this stuff is insane. Another one is basically like every Kenneth Cole fragrance. Now, it's not that they're bad fragrances, but a lot of young guys are getting into them because they're super affordable. And so, for me, a better alternative would be Dolce & Gabbana, the one. Creed Aventus, also another better option, or Creed Aventus Cologne. It's different than Creed Aventus, but it smells, once again, super incredible. All right, a few others that I think are a little bit dated, all right, Jacar. If you're still rocking, Jacar, I love you because you're a classic, but unfortunately, it's gotta go. I still love it, but it's gotta go, all right? Polo fragrances are hard, in my opinion, right? Polo red, I would not do. Also, Polo green. I think Polo is very like overpowering. Some other fragrances that I wouldn't do is LaCoste. Not good, like just not good. Calvin Klein, eternity for men, thumbs down. Jup! Get outta here. Abercrombie, fierce. It is fiercely not good if you're an adult dude. Whenever I smell it, right, it just reminds me of like the store and the fact that they are probably like a 16 year old dude that's trying to get his weenie wet and he's like, yo, I'm going right Abercrombie, fierce. Yeah, check it, right? And you just stink, all right? Hollister, another fragrance. They've got a few fragrances actually. Not good if you're an adult dude. It makes you smell like a teen. Any store, basically that caters to a younger demo that has its cologne, I would avoid. I'm also gonna include any sneaker company that has a fragrance, all right? You probably wanna avoid that as well or else you're gonna smell like her little brother. You go into a premium store like a Neiman Marcus, they're gonna have some displays of some boutique fragrances that are typically gonna be more expensive, but you can go in and you can smell them. And then what I do is do a little Google search to see what is an alternative to that fragrance, all right? And you're gonna find a bunch of different options. Some great fragrance houses, you know, Creed, I absolutely love, I love most of their fragrances. Tom Ford, I like some of their fragrances. A lot of their fragrances I feel are a little bit heavy or oppressive and I like a lighter, fresher fragrance personally. Another one, Roja, they make some incredible fragrances and Perfumes de Marley has been crushing the game. The other upside to going into a store like a Neiman Marcus or somewhere that sells the premium fragrances is that, you know, they're too expensive for a lot of these young dudes. And so what I'd recommend, like I said, go in and smell a few, find a few, write them down, I take pictures of the bottle, and then simply look online to a little Google search or go to YouTube to find similar fragrance alternatives because there are a lot out there and a lot of them are going to not break the budget. Guys, that's it. A few fragrances that I personally feel you should not wear because it makes you smell like a teen, unless you're a teen, and then still don't wear them."

        "transcript": " A few weeks ago, I did a video talking about some items that I feel are a total waste of money that nobody should buy. If you missed that video, I'm gonna link to it down below. But today, I'm gonna actually do the opposite. I'm gonna go over my list of some items that I feel are worth the money, even if it's expensive. Number one is a vacation. So last week, my wife and I went somewhere that I'd never been. It was the Cayman Islands. We went to the Grand Cayman. We stayed at a super bougie resort. It was the Ritz Carlton. And then we did something even bougier. We rented a private boat. Hold on, I'm gonna get to the story about that, but my guy Joel just got to the house and I was asking him what he thought. All right, what's something that's worth the money that might be expensive? My Toyota Tundra. Toyota Tundra? Toyota Tundra, which is not paying for this video, FYI, but before I even bought one, it was the one that I heard about on the job site all the time. Everyone that had one seemed to have no problems with it. Something else that I just got reminded of. All right, so right here, a ladder, power tools. All right, so I've gone to Home Depot and bought the Ryobi. And I'm not saying like Ryobi's crap, but it's not like Milwaukee. It's not like some of these other, you know, higher quality, you know, tools and things that you're gonna buy and you're gonna only buy it once. You don't need to replace it. Come back to my story about the private boat. So I went, I chartered this boat. It was $1,200. But I'm like, you know what? I could either ride an Akadamaran with 80 people out to these stingray or I could have a nice experience for my wife and I. So what did I do? I sprung for the $1,200 boat ride with these three dudes on this boat where in Grand Cayman, the water's beautiful. It's amazing and we're driving and we're cruising and we're like the music's blasting. It's an amazing experience. And then we get to the sandbar and all these stingray come like swimming up to the boat. So I got to actually get into the water and hang out and hold these like giant stingray. It was one of the coolest, if not the coolest experiences I've ever had and I will never forget it. It was totally worth the money. Something else it was is art. All right, in my opinion, art. Whether or not it's something that's original or something that's a print, it doesn't matter if it costs $100, $5 or $5,000. In my opinion, art is something that is absolutely worth the money if you absolutely love it. And the reason is pretty simple. Every single day I get to see my moose and I think about that feeling that I had when I actually first saw it. People come in, they're like, oh, I really like your moose. Art is one of those things that even if it's expensive, I feel is absolutely, absolutely worth every penny you pay. Next up, I wanna talk about some stylish items that in my opinion are worth whatever you pay for them. First up, these shoes I've talked about a bunch. They're my Gucci loafers. They were literally like $1,000. Now I know what you're thinking, you're like, dude, $1,000. I wear them so damn much. They work with a lot and the other cool thing is that they last. When you invest in a quality pair of leather shoes, they're gonna last longer, including boots. The other cool thing is that they also look great as they age, which brings me to something else. And that is a leather jacket. One of my best purchases I've ever made was my Coach Brown leather jacket. I don't have it anymore. Basically, I gave it to Antonio Santana, my boy. But the fact is, when you invest in a great leather jacket, it lasts basically years and years and years and it looks amazing. A suit, a high quality tailored suit, guys. Literally, you cannot beat. In terms of whenever you put it on, you just feel like the fucking man. It's amazing, but you gotta have it tailored properly. You also need a high quality suit. Nothing like super cheap or synthetic. My personal recommendation, of course, a suit supply, you're gonna spend a little bit more than if you're going into a cheap store, but the truth is, the suits that you're gonna find at a suit supply are premium in terms of quality and they're actually less expensive than a lot of the suits you're gonna find at like a men's warehouse at Joseph A. Banks or even Macy's. The other cool thing is you're gonna have like real buttons. The buttonholes are gonna be functioning and it's gonna be a better garment in terms of wearing, it's gonna look better and it's also gonna last longer. The next thing is watches. Guys, watches, in my opinion, are absolutely worth whatever you spend on them. Whether or not you're buying a $10,000, $20,000 Rolex or something affordable and sexy like this super bad ass Aura gentleman right now, limited time, 50% off site-wide. Check it out, another one of my favorite Aura watches. Guys, Aura offers premium quality for an incredible price and right now, for a limited time, like I said, if you go through my link, you're gonna grab one of these super bad ass watches for 50% off. You're getting a Sapphire crystal, all right? This one, an automatic Seiko movement, guys. You're getting super premium, high quality steel. I also love the fact that it has a butterfly clasp, right? Something else that you're gonna love. Look at that bracelet, like look at that bracelet. It's a little bit blingy, but 100% sexy. The rose gold, I absolutely love. This, I love, something else I love. But the chronograph, right? It's just a rugged masculine watch. This one in the steel is perfect. The black face, I love, they have different options. And the thing about the chronograph, guys, is that it's super premium as well. You've got the Sapphire crystal, the premium steel, but you also have a quartz Seiko movement, which is super premium. This is another one of my favorite, Auras. It's a skeletonized watch. They've got skeletonized watches, guys. Next level, once again, you've got that automatic movement, the open case back, so you can actually see it. And then this one, I put a rubber strap on. Guys, right now, they're doing something else that's amazing. If you grab one of their skeletonized watches, they're giving away a rubberized strap for free. All you gotta do is add the watch and then add the strap, and then the strap, the cost that's coming off at checkout, guys. All you gotta do right now, if you're interested in grabbing a super sick, premium, sexy-ass watch that is absolutely worth more than the money, because seriously, these watches should cost more, in my opinion, even the regular price. And that's the thing. They've been featured in Hypebeast and all sorts of different publications. And the price right now, you are never gonna find a better deal on a better watch, period. Hit the link down below. Do not wait, because they are gonna sell out pretty quickly, guys. These watches are so sick, so sexy, and absolutely something you need. You're gonna love it. You're gonna be able to wear it for years and years. Every time you look down at your wrist, you're gonna be like, damn, that's a sexy watch. Thanks, Alpha. Next up on my list is Cashmere. A Cashmere sweater, guys. Woo, baby. Yes, it's expensive, but is it the most buttery, soft thing you've ever slipped on? Is it gonna look great? Not only now, but in years, the answer is yes. Guys, Cashmere sweaters, I'm telling you. They're pricey, but they're amazing. Something else that's pricey and amazing is Lululemon. I don't wanna do it, but I gotta do it. Because honestly, the quality is there. And yes, it's expensive, but I've had these pants so long, it's ridiculous, and they still literally look like the day I got them. They are amazing. All right, I love them so much. I bought a few different pairs. All right, the Lululemon clothing that I got, whether or not it's a t-shirt, a tank top, running shorts, or whatever, it's just held up. And it looks great, it's comfortable, and it's super high quality stuff. And in my opinion, it's worth the money. Something else that's worth the money is premium running shoes. Here's somebody that runs, guys. You know what I'm talking about, but there is nothing better than slipping on a pair of running shoes or athletic shoes that really are just built super well. Yes, they're kinda ugly, but what I do is actually just go on Amazon, and because I go through them so much, because of how much I run, you gotta basically replace them every few hundred miles. I'll buy like a few pairs, and I don't care what the color is, I just know that they are the best running shoes and something that I personally will invest in. Guys, your feet, take care of them. Grooming, some grooming things, they're pricey, but in my opinion, you absolutely need them and should spend a little bit extra money. An electric toothbrush is a must. A high quality air dryer, absolutely. A natural deodorant, now here's the deal, right? Deodorants were not created equal. Natural deodorants are gonna be better for your body. They're also not gonna up up your endocrine system. Something else is higher quality hair products. Guys, your hair, you need to take care of it. By using the cheap shit you're gonna find in grocery stores or drug stores, it is damaging your hair, it's also drying it out. Speaking of dry skin care, also something else that in my opinion, you should absolutely invest in. Now, let's go to the kitchen, because we gotta talk about meat. To meat, should you eat organic and invest in more expensive beef, chicken, and all that stuff? I know that it's not sexy, right? There's sexier ways to spend money, like a badass watch or a cool sweater. Meat is one of those things, though, that the more I research, the more I learn, the more I realize that it's important to really make sure that the quality of the food that you're ingesting and putting into your temple actually is higher quality. A lot of the hormones and things that they're injecting into these meats aren't good for your body or your endocrine system, and so in my opinion, I personally feel like higher quality meats and foods is something that you should actually invest in. Bed, all right? Your mattress, the sheets, the comforter, the pillows, all the stuff, all the sexy situation with your bed guys. In my opinion, it's actually uncomfortable. It's important to spend the money on it. There is a huge difference when you sleep on a high quality mattress, but unfortunately, a mattress isn't sexy like a new watch or a badass sweater or some cool shoes, but it's something that you use every single day, like eight hours a day, you're laying on that bad boy, and so in my opinion, it is absolutely worth it to invest a little bit more money in a higher quality mattress and higher quality sheets that have a nice soft thread count, so when you slip into them, you're like, yo mama, that's sexy, and a great comforter, and some good pillows that don't eff up your neck. TVs and technology, do I think that it's worth the money? All right, so I bought premium TVs. I've also bought like Vizios, and honestly, I don't necessarily feel like the money is that well spent. Now I know that a lot of you right now out there that are into it are like, alpha, you're crazy, don't do a Vizio, you suck, right? And this isn't a Vizio, this is an expensive TV, and I can tell you that I don't get any more satisfaction of viewing pleasure out of this versus my Vizios that I used to have. Something I do, however, get a tremendous amount of satisfaction out of, and also feel like it is absolutely worth the money, fitness equipment, or a gym membership, whatever you pay for it, I feel it is absolutely worth it. Something else I feel is worth it is investing more money in higher quality fitness equipment, specifically treadmills and cardio equipment, all right? There's a huge difference. If you go into a place like the exporting goods store or Walmart, you get on their treadmill, it's like rickety, it's not that good, and typically it's going to basically fail you in a couple of years. They don't last because it's not built very well. But when you invest in a higher quality treadmill, like a land eyes, or some of these other treadmills that are out there on the market that are more built for commercial use, it is more expensive, but it's going to last you literally like for 20 years, and it's not going to be all rattly. Same thing goes for fitness equipment in terms of weights, all right? I used to own a gym, and so I am a huge equipment snob, and there is a big difference between the equipment you buy at a place like Fitness Depot, and a place you're going to buy at like Dix or Walmart, or someplace that sells equipment, but it's cheap, shitty equipment that doesn't work. And the last few things I want to mention are actually education related. If you can invest money, whatever the money is, or whatever you're spending on improving your skill set, or developing a higher value skill, in my opinion, it is absolutely worth whatever you're spending on it, right? Now, that being said, there are a lot of scam artists out there that just try to take your money, and try to teach you to do something that they've actually never done, all right? So you just got to be careful. But if there's something you can do, whether or not it's a trade school, or going to learn a different language, or whatever it may be, and these skills can improve your earning potential, or your job opportunities, in my opinion, it is absolutely worth the money. Gentlemen, any money you invest in yourself is absolutely worth it, because you're worth it. You're also amazing. But what did I miss? Guys, down below, let me know. What is something that you feel is worth the money, even if it's a little more expensive? Down below, let me know. If I get enough great answers, we'll do a part two."

        "transcript": " So there are some grooming tools that every well groomed gentleman needs to own. In order to be well groomed and look amazing, like a great pair of tweezers, you need these. A nose hair trimming tool, absolutely a must. And a perfect beard and body grooming tool, this is a Brio. It is the best, I will link to it down below. But on the flip side, there are other products that are in my opinion a huge colossal waste of money, as in like you just don't need them. Because A, they're not that good, B, they don't really work or C, it's just not needed in order to be well groomed. And remember, this video is my opinion. So if you don't agree with it, suck it, it's my opinion. The number one is Manscape Trimmers, alright? And I'm just gonna get this out of the way up front. I don't think they're bad products, I just think you don't need them. I think they're kind of a waste of money, especially if you own something like a Brio beard grooming tool, because this thing you can use on the rest of your body. The other reason why I don't really love this product that much, and I bought these with my own money, you know, one's got a light which is totally useless. The other thing that's really cool is you can take them in the shower, which if you ever tried to manscape wet hair, it's not very comfortable or effective. The blades are super cheap and the whole like skin safe technology is just kind of like BS. All they did was basically drop the blade a little bit lower than the top rake and it's not really skin safe. If you get it like really like in your like nut sack, you're gonna cut the shit out of it. In my opinion, never use anything motorized on your testicles. Yes, you can take the length down, right? But when it comes to making them smooth and sexy, you need to use a razor, but you don't need to use this razor or any razor that's got 18 blades. If your razor vibrates, if it's got like sonic action, if it heats up, you got sold and you are somebody that in my opinion got totally hosed and ripped off. Because not only are having like 27 blades bad for your skin and if you're somebody that suffers from breakouts or blemishes or ingrown hairs, it is literally like the devil to your skin. And the reason is pretty simple. Every single blade is like a separate pass over your face. And so if you're somebody that wants to have a close shave, all you need is a big bitch. Like that's it. Like the big razor, literally it's got a single blade. The single blade big guys, in my opinion, is the razor you should be using if you're anybody that gets like ingrown hairs or burns. Now if you're like, yo, that's a little barbaric. I would not disagree with you. All right. In my opinion, these are the superior razor. All right. The Gillette with two blades and a lubricating strip. Guys, this is the best razor on the market, in my opinion. The Groom Mate, which is a manual nose hair trimming tool. Have you guys ever tried this? This is like an OG in terms of men's grooming. The first time I got it, I'm like, oh, you just twi- and it literally like rips the hairs out of your nose. This thing is trash, in my opinion. Any tool that has a bunch of attachments, it does like everything, doesn't do anything well. And I'm just being honest, all right? I have tried so many grooming tools over the years, right? Everything from something like this to the brawn, right, that does like hair and beard and body. It doesn't do anything well. And that's the thing, guys. When you're talking about grooming tools, there are certain tools that basically are good for specific things. But when you buy a tool that basically has like all the different attachments, all the different bells and whistles, you're not going to get a quality tool. The Brio Beardscape is the best grooming tool on the market, period. It doesn't try to be a nose trimming tool and an eyebrow trimming tool, which I'll talk about that thing that you shouldn't buy in a second. But the bottom line is if you want to grab this tool, it is the best on the market, period. It comes with a bunch of attachments. It comes with a cool charging port. It's also got this cool like LED display that shows you the runtime, also the RPMs, because that's the other thing with this tool. You can actually adjust it, right? And that's one of the things. This tool gives you super control for doing one thing, trimming hair. Not your eyebrows, not your nose. Doesn't trim your nails. It doesn't whiten your teeth. It trims hair. It's got a titanium rake. It also has a ceramic blade that is adjustable. So you can do skin safe technology if you want to, all right? The deal is you've got crazy control with this tool and it is comfortable to hold. It just works. And the battery life, like literally, that's a thing. This thing will last you like a year before you have to charge it. Right now, I've got 237 minutes of runtime before I have to charge this thing. It's like forever. It also has a super comfortable like soft action grip on the side. Guys, and right now for a limited time, if you want to go and hit my special link down below, they're giving you a zero blade for free when you buy the Brio 2.0. It's a $25 value, guys. You're getting it for free, all right? It is a metal blade. That is amazing. All you do, guys, is pop the regular blade off. And then all you're going to do is pop on the zero blade and then you're going to trim, all right? This thing literally takes it skin bald, like literally. Look at this. Literally. This thing takes it skin bald. If you're somebody that has ingrown hairs or bumps, all you do is pop on the zero blade and it looks like you just shaved with a razor, except a razor is going to typically take it below the skin, which is why you break out, which is why you get the irritation. The zero blade, guys, is amazing. Do not use this, though, on your testicles. It will cut your balls. I literally learned everything the hard way when it comes to grooming. Guys, when you go through my special link down below, you're going to get the zero blade, a $25 value for free when you buy the best grooming tool on the market. Is it the best hair cutting tool? No, because it's specifically designed for beards and body. If you want to cut your hair, guys, can you use a beard grooming tool? You can, but your hair is going to look a lot better if you buy a proper hair cutting set, all right? Wall makes incredible hair cutting sets. Now, this one, the brawn, is trying to say, hey, I do a little bit of everything. I have a nose hair trimming tool. I also have a smaller blade for trimming your body, but then I also have adjustments so that you can actually trim your hair. Guys, I've tried it. It doesn't work. Invest in a quality tool that is designed for the job that you want it to do. The mini groomsman, which does your eyebrows. It also does your nose hair in any little minor details and edging. It doesn't do anything really well, all right? The nose hair trimming tool doesn't work that well. It's not that powerful. It also isn't that sharp. Any tool that basically has a guide for you to do your eyebrows, I say avoid it. Eyebrow hair needs a little bit more attention to detail, which is going to require a small comb, scissors, and a mirror, all right? That is the best and ideal way in order to trim your eyebrows. Not a tool that has a guard, all right? I've seen way too many guys just run it over there and their eyebrows end up being way too short. And when your eyebrows are too short, all right, it just looks awkward and like you're missing eyebrows, all right? You got to learn to trim them properly. Also, this bad boy, the Narellco One Blade, I also think is kind of a waste of money. This thing is literally like 60 bucks. Narellco One Blade, right? It's this little razor that has like a bunch of different attachments. And once again, it doesn't do like any one thing particularly well. Now if I was stranded on like a desert island and it was like spicy San Rita city, right? And I need the trim by Bush and I only had this. Yeah, I'd use it. Next thing that's a waste of money, in my opinion, is any type of electric, all right, face brush. I used to use one of these because I didn't know any better. At the time I thought, wow, I really need to be scrubbing my face every single day twice a day to remove the oil dirt, the grime that builds up. And it's not the case. It actually does damage to your skin by overly being aggressive or overly exfoliating. Instead, what you should use is basically a high quality face wash in the shower or at the sink and just use your fingertips and warm water in order to gently remove the dirt. Blackhead removing tools, all right? So there are a lot of ways to remove blackheads on your nose or your body or your face, all right? The suction devices that you'll see, in my opinion, you should avoid those. And the reason is because they can potentially once again damage your skin. In my opinion, the Biori strips that you use like once a month is ideal. And as long as you wash your face twice a day, you're going to be good, right? The gunk isn't going to build back up into the pores. And if the pores aren't clogged, you don't need to use the strips, all right? So if you're using the strips also isn't great for you. If you've got blackheads, use them. If you don't, don't. And the last two things we're going to talk about are beard related, all right? The micro-needling derma rollers, are they a waste of money? All right, so I've done a bunch of research about like what they do and how they work and the verdicts out. They may help stimulate facial hair growth by when you actually use it. The idea is that it's going to bring more collagen and blood to the surface and the follicle to help stimulate growth. I've seen mixed reviews and mixed results on this. If you think it works, then use it. If you don't think it works or you're not sure if it's going to work, then don't waste your money. And last but certainly not least, this one's so ridiculous to me. It's the beard templates, all right? They're plastic like things that you put on your face that help you like follow along and like edge your beard. They are the dumbest thing in my opinion. It's not that complicated. Guys, the line on your beard on your jaw right here is ear, corner your mouth, straight line, shave above, leave below, and then underneath. Once again for the kids in the back. I've mentioned this 6,000 times. Head straight, take your finger, boom, shave below, leave above, that's it."

        "transcript": " 2025 is right around the corner. And so today what I thought I'd actually do is go over my list of some stupidly simple ways for you to crush 2025. You're going to look better. You're going to feel better. So this list was actually pretty fun to make, but it ended up being gigantic. All right, it's huge. A lot of things I came up with. But the truth is, if you implement one, two, three, five of these, you're going to be amazed at how much better you look, how much better you feel, and how much more ass you kick in 2025 because I really feel like we overcomplicate things, right? A lot of times we think, oh, we need this like big strategy and plan and like routine in order to really change our lives. When really it's the small subtle things that make a big difference. And when you stack a bunch of all on top of each other, you're going to be amazed at how much better you are at the end of next year versus right now. Please note, these are in no particular order. All right, they're all important in my opinion, some more important than others. But the most important is right here, sleep. You got to make sure you're getting better sleep. Seven to eight hours a night minimum. If you're not, that's honestly the place that you should actually start, which means you got to spend less time on your social media, which is the next tip. Guys, put your phone away. You don't need it. I'm telling you. And if you're laying in bed and you're surfing, it is definitely something that's going to impact you. The next thing we got to talk about is water. Drink 120 ounces a day, period. Reduce the amount of alcohol you're consuming. The recommended daily allowance of alcohol just to be clear is zero. A few drinks though won't hurt you. Improve your diet. Start eating more vegetables. Reduce the amount of starchy shit that you're eating. If you're eating a diet that's high in sugar, cut it out. Eat healthier, higher quality meats. I'm not saying that you have to go like 100% organic, but I'm telling you, the more I learn and research about the hormones that are pumped into a lot of the meats that we're consuming, the more I realize that it's worth spending a little bit more money on higher quality food. Guys, what you consume matters greatly. Take your vitamins. More specifically, a multivitamin. If you're not taking a high quality multivitamin, you are totally missing out. Now, some other vitamins I'd like to recommend. A vitamin C is amazing. It's an incredible antioxidant. Antioxidants are important for fighting free radical damage, not only for your skin, but for your body to be healthy. If you drink, you definitely need to take something for your liver, because your liver is taking a beating these days with all the crap that we're eating, we're drinking, we're smoking, which brings me to the next thing. If you're smoking anything, whether or not you're vaping or you're smoking something like that's fun or something that's like nicotine, cut it out. Smoking is one of the worst things for you. And if you don't realize that by now, like shame on you, you're going to save money. You're going to look better. You're going to feel better. Also, meal prepping. I'd recommend you meal prep once a week. It's a quick way for you to basically get your meals planned out for the week. Prior planning prevents poor diet performance. All right. The more you can plan your diet, the better off you're going to be. And the healthier you're going to be in 2025. All right. Also, reduce the amount that you're eating out. For me, I eat out twice a week. That's it. Stop drinking sugary drinks. Like period, the sodas, the energy drinks, terrible for you. It's empty calories and it's just really not good for you. All right. Something else that's not good for you is looking bad in terms of your grooming, which is actually the next place I'd like to go and talk a little bit about. All right. We're going to go downstairs and I'm going to talk about fitness a little bit later. We're also going to talk about mindset and money a little bit later on in this video. This video, like I said, is all over the place, but I feel like it's important. Grooming is also very important. Simple, quick, easy things you can do. Number one, whiten your teeth. All right. If your teeth are discolored, get some crest strips. Put those bad boys on a few days a week and boom, your teeth are going to be dazzling white because even if you got jacked up grill, your teeth are going to look better if they're white. But if you want to, go get braces, another tip. Go get veneers, another tip. Go get Invisalign, another tip. Get straighter teeth. If you're something that's insecure, weird about your teeth, go get it fixed. Next up is your skin. Fix it. How are you going to do that? Simple. Wash your face twice a day, exfoliate twice a week, moisturize morning and night, develop a skincare routine. Hair. All right. If your hair's falling out, go see Bosley. Or go get a hair transplant or start finasteride or minoxidil. If you don't want to lose your hair, you don't have to. Maybe this is the year for you to be like, yo mama, check it out. The hair is sexy. But if you've got hair or for the hair that you have, a few things I'd like to recommend. Go get a better cut. Go to a stylist as opposed to a barber. All right. Maybe let your hair grow out a little bit this year. Let it rock. Let the flowing locks frolic like spawning salmon swimming up the capistrano. Condition your hair. Every time you shampoo, you should be conditioning. And the reason is because conditioner is going to help smooth the hair cuticle. It's going to replace a lot of the nutrients and the hydration that was lost through shampooing and just atmosphere, like just jacking up your hair. If you really want to see a big difference in terms of how healthy and amazing your hair looks, not to mention how quickly you get ready in the morning, upgrade the quality of the hair dryer you're using. All right. The deal is if you're using a cheap hair dryer, it's drying your hair out. It's stripping it of moisture and it's damaging your hair. Instead, use this. All right. I'm going to link to this down below. It is the Leifenswift SE. This is the hair dryer that I use that I love. That is the best on the market in my opinion. It's not even just my opinion. Everybody agrees. This is the best hair dryer on the market and the price. That's the thing that's so insane. If you're not familiar with like high end hair dryers or you've never actually tried one, you're missing out because it makes a huge difference in not only how your hair looks, how healthy it is, but how quickly it actually dries. In the old days, right? The first like high end hair dryer I heard of was the Dyson and I was like, wait a second, 450 bucks for a hair dryer. You got to be like smoking crack. No way. Right? And then I tried one and then I bought one, but I didn't really talk about it because I was embarrassed to the fact that it's like a $450 hair dryer and that in my opinion is too expensive. But then I saw my buddy Travis who did a review a side by side comparison of the Lafen and the Dyson and regardless of the price, regardless of the fact that this is literally like a fraction of the price of a Dyson, this is a better hair dryer. And there are a bunch of reasons I'm not going to bore you with, you know, all the technology that's built into this, but this thing is a beast. All right. Just a few things you can see. Can you see that blue ring? Right? I hit that button. See it turns orange and then I hit it again. It turns red. I hold that button down. Right? And then I cycle through the different temperatures. All right. This is cutting edge hair technology. You've got different speeds. You also have two different magnetic nozzles. This is the one that I use, but it also has the bigger one that basically like can get in there and like give you like lots of volume. Guys, if you have not grabbed one of these, I've got a special link down below that's going to give you up to 30% off. This deal is not going to last. Guys, I've got a special limited time link down below. If you want to grab the Leifenswift SE for the best price out there, it's actually the best price I've ever seen up to 30% off of an already like ridiculous. And when I mean ridiculous, the price is so crazy. I literally don't know how they sell this quality of a product for the price that they do, but they do. Leifens has been killing the game. There's a link down below. Do not wait. I would recommend getting one for yourself or getting one for your mom, your weird Aunt Brenda or your sister or your girl because literally if anybody in your life tries your Leifens, they're going to steal the shit because it is the best hairdryer anybody has ever used. And it's not just my opinion. Go read the reviews. This thing is the best of beard growing. If you don't have a beard at this point, you need one or at least you need to try it. If you grow it in and it's a little bit patchy, then you might want to trim it up. But the deal is guys, a beard is a quick, easy, stupidly simple way to look more attractive. Cat. Get a cat. This is Piglet. She's 18 years old and still looking amazing. But a cat is a great way to do something incredible if you're not going to like forget to feed it. But cats in my opinion, get what you want. You want, you want some more of this action? The deal is if you want to quickly upgrade and elevate your life in 2025, get a better fragrance or switch it up or get some, you're back up. You little, she's such a slut. Next thing I'd recommend is make sure your ears are clean. All right. Also your breath. If it's not fresh, fix it and shave your balls. If I didn't mention that already, shaving your balls will change your life. I'm just saying it kind of will. Next up, what I want to talk about a little bit is productivity, money and business. Wake up 30 minutes earlier. 30 minutes doesn't seem like a lot. Now in the morning, like if you're not used to it, it does, but it gets easier and you're going to develop the habit, which gives you time to actually sit down and actually write and journal, plan the day. And this is something that I feel will improve your life. Being mindful, all right. Being present, something else that I would encourage each and every one of you to really focus on in 2025 is being more present. A lot of times we think about what we need to do or where we need to go or what we are trying to achieve, but being present in the moment feels incredible. It also is going to make you basically live a more rich and full life because you're not always chasing something, which brings me to something else. What is your new goal for 2025? What is like the big goal, right? You got to have a little like few like smaller goals, but I feel like everybody needs like that one like North Star. If you don't have one, get one compliments. Start giving strangers compliments. If you want to start with people that you know, because it's a little bit more comfortable, fine, but what are you waiting for gentlemen? It feels great to get a compliment. It feels even better to give it. Also what I want you to do is call your grandma. Call your grandparents because you're not going to have them forever and take it from somebody that has lost his. You're going to miss them when they're gone. And so I would recommend every week, give them a call. Just say, Hey, grandma, you don't need to be on long five minutes. That's it. Right. Style. All right. Let's talk about it a little bit. What can you do? Number one is clean out your wardrobe. If you've got a bunch of chaos and clutter all over the place, you're not going to be able to operate your wardrobe effectively and efficiently. If you've got a bunch of white t-shirts or white shirts and they got pit stains, throw them out. Go shopping for some affordable options that are going to look better and that are going to basically compliment your body, which brings me to the next thing. Wear clothing that fits your body. If it's big, if it's baggy, you don't look as sexy. All right. Throw out any shoes, any clothing that's super trendy. It's not cool anymore. If you're rocking leather shoes, make sure they're clean. Make sure they're polished. If your shoes are dirty, get rid of them. All right. If you're not actually, we'll get to that in a second. Yeah, exactly. White sneakers, they work and match with everything. Get a pair. All right. Brown sneakers also are pretty cool, but they're not as cool as brown boots. Guys, brown boots in my opinion are a quick, easy way for you to elevate your style. Something else that is, is outerwear. One of the things you can do to quickly, easily elevate your style is to get better jackets. All right. Everybody can wear a great pair of jeans when it springs me to another tip and that is elevate your jeans. Guys, if you've got a pair of jeans that are too tight, too big, too baggy, too like distressed, it's time to upgrade. And one of the things that you can invest in is a great pair of jeans. They're going to basically pay dividends long term. You're also going to have an amazing looking booty if you do squats, which we'll talk about a little bit later. Suits. Get one. Get one tailored. Suit. Invest in a higher quality suit that is tailored for your body. It makes a huge difference. You're going to feel better. You're going to look better. Every time you slip that bitch on, you're going to be like, damn, mama, check me out. I look amazing because you do. White dress shirt. Invest in one that is tailored for your body. It makes a big difference. Next up, accessories. Let's talk about it. A ring, I think is a great addition to any dude's hand because they're cool. They're masculine. They're rugged and they look good. All right. Something else that looks good is a watch. All right. An Apple watch doesn't count. All right. If you are currently not rocking a watch, you need one because it's a quick, easy style upgrade to look better to feel better. If you want to go with the chain, a bracelet, that also works. And your wallet. If you're rocking a big, fat wallet, do better. Get a slim card holder or something that isn't going to be big and bulky in your pockets. Let's talk a little bit about social things that you can do that are quick and easy. Number one, say yes more than you say no. All right. This one is pretty cliche at this point, but I'm a firm believer that, or I should say for me, I will get into a rut where I don't want to go out. I don't want to do anything. And it's easier for me just to be like, no, no, no, as opposed to saying yes or looking for something to go and do. All right. Look for something to do. If somebody invites you to go do something and you're like, I'm not sure what if it sucks, go see if it sucks. Don't just say no, just because you're not wanting to get out of your comfort zone, which brings me to the next thing. And that is get out of your comfort zone every single day, every single week. Look for opportunities to do something different. All right. Whether or not it's joining a sports league and in a mural league, a dart league, a billiards league, like whatever, look for a club, find your tribe, look for opportunities to meet people that are like you making new friends, something I want you to do in 2025. A lot of times we hang out with the people that we've known for a really long time, even if they're not bringing value to your life. And so what I'd recommend is look for higher value friends. They are going to help you on your high value journey, which brings me to the next thing you can do. Learn a high value skill. Invest in yourself. Do something or find something that you're passionate about or that you enjoy or that you think you'd be good at and then invest the time, the energy, the money in building higher value skills, which will in turn make you more money in the longterm. When it comes to money, a few other things I'd like to recommend. Stop living below your means. All right, this may mean you got to look for a different place to actually live or drive a less expensive car. Stop buying shit you don't need. How much crap did you buy in 2024 that you look back on? You're like, yo, I never wore that or I wore it once or God, that was a waste of money. Right? Stop doing it. And if you're buying it on credit, you can't afford it. Period. If you're not paying cash for it, don't buy it. Period. And if you could save a little bit of extra, that's what I'd recommend. 10% of your salary, save it. It's a great way to basically build a little bit of a nest egg. And then when you have a little extra money, you can invest it, which brings me to the next thing. Look for opportunities to invest. It doesn't mean you got to swing wildly for the fences or invest in cryptocurrency, but the fact is the fundamentals still work. Looking for mutual funds or investing in some type of Roth IRA, look for opportunities to put your money to work. Because if you are always working hourly wages for money, you will literally work until the day that you die. You've got to put that money to work, which brings me to something else. Educate yourself. Education is never too heavy to carry out of a ditch. That is something that my grandfather taught me and something that I've always kind of remembered. Educate yourself, increase those high value skills, and you will make more money, which brings me to something else that you should do. And that is update your resume. It's quick. It's easy, but it could be possibly worth millions if not thousands of dollars. Guys, I'm telling you, if you're not happy with your current job, time to look for something else, life is too short to hate what you do every single day and cut toxic people out of your life. As in like they don't deserve you, which brings me to something else. Learn to say no, learn to say no. I know I said quick and easy, right? That's actually not easy. If you're a people pleaser like me, but you got to cut the toxic people. You also need to take care of yourself and respect your time. You also need to respect your body, which is a temple, which is why you need to start exercising, join a gym. There was one thing that I would wish for you to do or to start developing if you're not already doing it in 2025. It is an exercise routine, working out, taking care of your body. Because from this one thing, this one simple action that's not actually that simple, but once you develop a habit, it's actually really easy to keep going. And when you don't do it, you feel bad because you don't feel good, you don't look good, and it's a mindset thing. This one thing, exercise, will have the biggest impact on your life. Not only for you looking good and feeling good, it's what it does to your mind. It is amazing. It is literally like instant confidence. You feel good, your mind, it gets sharper, it gets stronger, and then every single aspect of your life will get better. When you take care of yourself, when you are selfish with your time, when you are selfish with your exercise and you don't let anything stand in its way, it's amazing how everything else gets better. I'm telling you, if there was one thing I'd want you to do, it's work out. Period. But the other stuff I mentioned in this video, also super important. Guys, what did I miss? Down below, let me know. What is something you can do that is quick, almost stupidly simple that will help somebody improve their life? Down below, let me know."

        "transcript": " So just because you're young and you look good doesn't mean that your testosterone level is where it needs to be. Quite the opposite actually. A lot of research and data is coming out showing that our testosterone levels as men is starting to drop younger and younger and younger. Now, the reality is that at about the age of 30 most guys their testosterone starts to drop at about 1% per year. But at around 40 years old it starts to actually speed up. And by 45 you're basically losing 2-3% of your total testosterone level every single year. Today guys, I'm going to break this video up into three parts. We're going to talk about number one, why our testicles are not producing testosterone like they used to. Number two, we're going to go over some of the warning signs. Now some of these signs you're probably familiar with, right? But a lot of them are sneaky under-the-radar type signs that if you identify them you can go and you can fix them. And then the third part which you definitely do not want to miss is some quick and easy ways that you can naturally help your balls produce more of that mythical, amazing, magical, hormone testosterone. So why is our testosterone level dropping in the first place? Alright, other than the natural aging process which I've come to realize you can actually reverse which I'm going to actually share with you later in this video like I mentioned. Alright, so number one is we're fat. We're fat as fuck as a society. We're lazy. We're eating shit food which is the next reason. We're eating chemicals. We're eating all sorts of horrible things for us that's increasing our body fat. When our body fat is up it basically converts testosterone into estrogen. When our estrogen is high our testosterone level gets suppressed. Alright, number three is we're sedentary. We're not moving like we used to. In the old days we had to go out and fight and hunt for gazelles and cheetahs and lions to drag back to those spicy sinuretas and all our little kids. Now the only hunting we're doing is on like Uber Eats to see who can deliver us a pizza. Exactly. Not to mention we're sitting there. We're not going out. We're not getting active. We're not lifting weights as much as we should. Guys, you got to get active. You also need to get out into the sunshine. Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiencies are at an all time high for men. And when your vitamin D level is low all sorts of bad shit happens including testosterone. DDC chemicals are one of the biggest offenders in terms of things that are destroying our testosterone level as men. Everything from the hair product we're using to the body washes we're using and the deodorant. Deodorant is one of the worst things that you can rub on your body. They're starting to link all sorts of horrible things to a lot of the products we're using. And the aluminum found in any pursuant deodorants have been linked to like brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, not to mention like dementia, which is terrible. A lot of the talc and the products that we're using like honorable specifically like talc powder once again is also horrible for your body. There's asbestos that is found in talc that is linked to cancer. Just do a little Google search. It's not just my opinion. It's science. You've got to start looking for it on the products. Aluminum free, paraffin free, sulfite free. Guys, I'm going to link down below to these two products. I actually want to give you a deal. All right. The deodorant, it's a natural deodorant. This is the best natural deodorant on the market. The scent is eucalyptus spearmint. It is sexy. It literally lasts all day long. Go read the reviews. Everybody is loving this deodorant. The reason why I developed this deodorant guys was because I was tired of rubbing toxic chemicals underneath of my armpits. But I wanted something that actually worked, which was one of the problems with standard natural deodorants. They don't really work that well. It took like 57 different variations and formulas guys, but I nailed it. This is the best natural deodorant on the market. I'm also going to include the talc free ball powder guys. Bottom line is your testicles stink, but you should not rub talc powder on them. The talc free ball powder by Pete and Pedro also is a game changer. It is the best powder on the market. It's talc free. It is sulfite free. It is paraffin free. It keeps your ball smelling fresh and amazing. Guys, I've got a special link down below. I'm giving you a deal. All right. Normally these two products together would be $34, but right now if you go through my link, you're going to get them for $24. It's literally 30% off because I want you to be healthier. I also want you to smell amazing guys. Do not wait. This deal is for a limited time. Hit the link down below. Some other reasons why our testosterone level is dropping as men. We're drinking more alcohol than we ever have before. Specifically beer with hops. Hops is a phyto estrogen or a plant-based estrogen. When you drink a lot of beer, basically your estrogen level is going to increase. Your testosterone level is going to decrease. All right. Marijuana use also another thing that is impacting our fertility, but also our balls ability to produce that amazing mythical, magical male hormone, testosterone. So now let's go over some of the signs that your testosterone level is low. All right. Number one is sex drive. All right. Testosterone is the hormone that basically controls our urge to go out and just tear it up and do things, even if it's by ourselves. Right. The fact is if you're not feeling it, if you're not interested, this is something that you got to pay attention to. It's not normal. Now, of course, sometimes you might not be in the mood for it. Right. That's fine. Maybe you're stressed out. You had a long day, whatever, whatever you ate a burrito, when it's not agreeing with you, I get it. But if this is a common thing, you might want to go get your testosterone level checked. All right. Number two is your erections. We got to talk about that because big L is kind of like your check engine light. If something is going on with you and you can't get them to go up, that's a sign either something else is wrong, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or your testosterone level is dropping. But it's not just about not being able to get it up. It's also about the strength and the firmness of him, because testosterone is also correlated to nitric oxide. All right. Nitric oxide is the thing that basically dilates or relaxes the blood vessels. It goes in and it makes them super rock solid. And so if you're not having very firm or hard erections like you used to, another sign, something is going on. Chances are it's your testosterone level. Your testicles, something else we got to talk about. If they are shrinking or you feel like they're not as big or full as they used to be, another sign your testosterone level is low. If when you do have like an ejaculate or you like finish your business, if the semen volume is lower or less than it used to be, another sign of low testosterone. If you're going to the gym on a regular basis and you're having a difficult time putting on muscle mass, another sign testosterone level is on the decline. Or if your body fat is going up and you really haven't changed that many other things about your lifestyle or your diet, another sign that your testosterone level is dropping. The reason why a lot of men develop like man boobs and love handles as they start to age or they develop that dad bod, it's not because they're super like inactive, that's part of it. But the main reason is because their testosterone level has started to fall and they didn't do what they needed to do in order to boost it back up. The next thing we got to talk about is your brain. In terms of your ability to recall things quickly or remember things. If you're having a more difficult time remembering things or you're starting to misplace things on a regular basis, chances are your testosterone level is starting to drop. If you're having a difficult time sleeping, you're not sleeping as soundly as you used to, another warning sign of testosterone level that is low. Another one that's pretty crazy is mood swings. Maybe you're angry or you're depressed or you're sad or you're bummed out. This is not normal. All right. If you are not feeling good or you're not feeling energetic or excited, this is a sign that something is going on. Typically it's going to be with your testosterone. And that's one of the things you got to understand. Your testosterone level controls so many different aspects of your life as a man in terms of the way that you look, the way that you feel. The next thing is hair loss. Histosterone and hair loss pretty much go hand in hand. If you are experiencing any type of hair loss anywhere on your body, you got to go and get a check. Now, how are you going to know for fact if your testosterone level is where it needs to be or if it's dropping and that is go in and get a blood test. You got to go get a blood test in order to truly know what's happening with your testosterone level. But I'm a fan and a firm believer that at about the age of like 30, you should start every single year going to get blood work done because that's going to give you a baseline. It's going to give you a baseline of a lot of other functions in your body, not to mention liver function, kidney function, your cholesterol, things like that. Pistostrone, knowing what your testosterone level is every single year is critical for you to manage it naturally. Because one of the mistakes that guys make is that they're like, oh, my testosterone level is low and then boom, automatically they jump on TRT when. The truth is that there are lifestyle modifications or changes you can make or supplements that you can take naturally that will help you boost it. Now, what I'd like to do is go over some of the things that I have done in order to basically get my testosterone level on the upswing. It was as low as like 500 and like 20 a few years ago, but then I started to do and modify my lifestyle along with some of my supplements and it has drastically increased and now over 800 naturally. I look better, I feel better and I honestly am excited to go in and get it checked again in another three months because I feel like it's going up again. All right. So here's the deal. Few things that you can do to boost it back up. Exercise, you got to exercise in my opinion every single day. It is the one thing you can do to help keep your testosterone level in check. And when you lift heavy shit, the big three lifts, squats, deadlifts, bench press, your body basically is going to release more testosterone. It's like your body's giving you a little like testosterone knuckle bump for doing hard shit. Number two is supplementation. All right. Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc and L-carnitine. L-carnitine is a natural amino acid that has been shown to actually naturally boost your testosterone level. Do a little Google search of testosterone L-carnitine and you will see a bunch of articles, but it was something that quickly you can do to basically get it on the upswing. All right. Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, like we talked about, critical micronutrients for testosterone production. Diet. Your diet is so incredibly critical for your ball's ability to produce that amazing mythical magical juice, aka testosterone. All right. You got to do the basic things, right? Don't eat a bunch of shit food. All right. A lot of saturated nonsense. The cleaner you can eat, the better your body will look, but also the better your testicles will do in terms of producing testosterone. The less you drink, the less you do recreational stuff, the better off your testosterone level is going to be. And then do better in terms of your grooming products. All right. You got to start looking for the labels that say sulfite-free, parapan-free, aluminum-free. All right. Because if a product doesn't have it, it basically is bad for you. In conclusion, gentlemen, testosterone is on the decline. And as a man, you need it. If it's not good, if it's low, if your balls aren't producing it in the manner, in the fashion, in the quantity that you need it, you're not going to look good. You're not going to feel good. Life is not going to be as sweet. You're also not going to be getting that action that I know you want because dudes want action. If you don't want action, that's a sign that you probably have low testosterone and you definitely needed this video. But the bottom line is this. Do the things that we talked about in this video. If you identify that something is off, something's wrong, or there's something that I mentioned that's kind of like, uh-oh, light bulb, that's me, go to the doctor, get it checked. And then by doing the things that we talked about and outlined in this video, you are going to basically help your balls produce more amazing testosterone. I don't want you to get on TRT if you don't need it. Because once you go on TRT, you're not coming off. Like, it's it. Like, you're on it for the rest of your life because your body literally will shut down production. And I'm a firm believer that if you take care of your body, you can basically help it be healthy naturally longer."

        "transcript": " So dressing to look high value doesn't mean that you're wearing super premium expensive clothing. But it does mean you don't have cat hair on your jacket. It does mean that you're not wearing worn out underwear. And it does mean you're not wearing an Apple watch. Haha, I'm just kidding. Not, not, not kidding actually at all. The fact is guys, there are some things that you are wearing that unfortunately are making you look low value to other people. The sooner you excommunicate them from, your life and wardrobe, the sooner you will look and be perceived as a high value dude. Alright guys, so the first up is the three things I already mentioned. Alright, if you've got lint hair or anything like fuzzy in terms of like fuzzy balls on your body, you gotta shave them. If you've got fuzzy balls on your sweater, your jacket like a peat coat, or a sweater, you gotta shave them gentlemen. You gotta remove them because it looks terrible. If you've got cat hair, dog hair, dandery, you gotta get one of these bad boys, the lint roller, literally. You get them on Amazon for three bucks, you'll use it before you go out of the house and you'll look a lot higher value as opposed to a dude that looks crusty and nasty. Number two is nasty undies, alright? If you're wearing underwear that are worn out and some spicy scene you eat is like, oh Brian, I wanna get sexy. You get down to your boxers or if you're wearing boxers that actually also makes you look low value because no self-respecting dude wears big baggy boxers. You wear boxer briefs. If you're wearing underwear like this, worn out, tidy whiteies, you also look low value. Number three is a tech watch, alright? So the truth is, I'm not saying it makes you look low value, I'm saying though that it does make you look unstylist. Whenever I look down at a dude's wrist, cause I'm a watch guy, I notice dude's wrist and I see his rockin' a tech watch, I automatically know that he only likes to do it missionary. Ha ha ha ha, what am I even talking about exactly? Number four, we gotta talk about baseball hats boys because here's the deal, if it's dirty, low value, alright? Nothing makes you look scuzzier than like a dirty hat that's got like tears and rips. You see them, right? It makes you look literally like you don't care about life. Savage, I'm kidding. I actually really like the smell of Savage. I know I give it a hard time in these videos, but the truth is, it's a good fragrance, alright? But the thing that I don't like about it is that everybody wears it and so you're gonna smell like literally her ex-boyfriend. But what I wanted to get at is if you're wearing too much fragrance, this makes you look low value, alright? Even if the fragrance is high value, it's expensive and you smell good, wearing too much of anything, even if it's a good thing, makes you low value. A goatee, ha ha ha, like a redneck goatee. You know what I'm talking about? Like a big fuzzy like muff face makes you look low value. A band tattoo makes you look low value. Now you're like, yo, Alpha, all tattoos these days are pretty bad and you wouldn't be wrong. I did a video recently talking about why not having a tattoo in today's world makes you the badass and the reality is I'm not saying that tattoos look bad on everybody, but a lot of tattoos these days are bad that everybody is getting and everybody is getting tattoos. And even though right now you may think, yo, I love it. It's awesome. It's super sexy. Give it five years. It's not gonna be sexy. And the other reality is that when somebody sees you and you are covered with tattoos, they have the perception that you are uneducated and possibly lower value. I'm not saying you are, but this is the perception. Facial piercings, whether or not it's eyebrows or nose or lip or just piercings all over your taint, your nipples, like wherever. If you've got a lot of piercings, also people perceive this as low value. If you've got blue hair or pink hair or red hair, low value. And here, one more time for the kids in the back. I'm not saying you are. I'm just saying that other people have the perception of you being lower value. Now, once again, don't get it twisted. I am not saying you are. I'm just saying that this is the perception of other people. All right? It's a fact. All right? Something else that's a fact is if you have a fucked up beard. And what I mean by that is if your beard is super like big and nasty and unkempt, this makes you look low value and also makes you look stinky. You've got a neck beard growing down. Low value. If it's not edged up and it's growing up your face, low value. If you've got nose hair, low value. If you've got crazy eyebrows, low value. If you've got effed up skin, low value. A toupee, a bad toupee, low value. All right? And yes, people can tell. I'm just saying it looks bad. Also, here's the deal. If you are somebody that is losing your hair and you're all like, yo, I'm not even like losing it and you're trying to cover it and do all sorts of weird things. Also, a little bit low value. Gentlemen, embrace it. Grow a beard, shave your head, get some cool frames. Period. End of story. Next up, let's talk about some suits. All right? If you're wearing a big baggy suit, low value. If you're wearing a suit that a pants, that puddle down by your ankle, low value. You got a tailor and you got a taper. All right? If you're wearing a little boy polo, whoa mama. Now we're talking low value. Gentlemen, you got to upgrade that shit. This is the collars and co-polo. You need one. Actually, you probably need a few of them, but the bottom line is this. All right? There's a big difference between wearing a polo that is a dress shirt inspired polo with a proper collar as opposed to one that's all whack, beat up, that's curling, and all nasty. Gentlemen, here's the truth. If you want to upgrade your wardrobe instantly, I want you to hit that special link down below. Collars and co, they make more than just perfect polos. That is how they got started though, right? I first heard about them when I was watching Shark Tank. Mark Cuban invested literally a million dollars in this company because he knew it solved the problem that so many dudes are facing and that is how do you wear a polo and not look low value? 99% of the polos on the market are shit, gentlemen, because they look terrible and you also can't dress them up. That's one of the things that collars and co basically solves. You can wear their polo underneath of a sport coat or a suit or even a sweater and look amazing because the collar, look at that bitch. Rigid, sexy, perfect. Dress shirt collar, the placket a little bit deeper, the fabric, buttery, soft and sexy. Gentlemen, which works perfectly standing by itself like with a great pair of slacks like I'm rocking right here or dressed up as a base layer underneath of a sport coat or suit. Which brings me to the next thing that makes you look low value and that is clothing that doesn't fit your body. Alright, whether or not it's pants that are too big, too bulky, too baggy or they're hanging down, you got a big super long crotch, low value gentlemen or your shirt is big, it's baggy, you got a muffin top popping out of that bitch or the collars all effed up or the sleeves are too long or the jacket is too big, too bulky, not tailored to your body. Gentlemen, the fact is how your clothing fits matters greatly. It's going to make you look taller, it's going to make you look sexier, alright? This outfit, one of my favorite old money style outfits, right? I got the navy blazer, this bad boy is also from collars and co. I got another collars and co. polo underneath and I've got a great pair of slim fit pants that I had tailored because I know the importance of tailoring, especially if you're a short dude like I am, the pant, the brand is actually theory. The loafers are sexy, alright? Perfect. Now, the thing that I love about this jacket so much and if you missed the video, I did talking about blazer rules and how to actually wear a blazer properly. I've got a link to that video down below. If you haven't seen that video guys, I want you to hit that link and watch it, alright? Because most guys get styling a blazer or a sport coat wrong. And if you don't know the difference between a blazer and a sport coat, you definitely need to watch that video. Guys, hit the link down below if you're looking to upgrade your wardrobe, alright? And look, super high value without spending a ton of cash. And once you check out collars and co, they have a lot more than just perfect polos. They've got blazers, they've got sweaters, they've got pants, they've got button ups, they've got outerwear. Guys, collars and co is crushing the game and you are going to look sexy. Hit the link down below, don't wait because that link is special. It's going to save you some cash on some amazing high value sexy ass clothes. Next up is your belt, gentlemen. Alright, so here's the deal. Belts are one of the things that totally effs up your look and your value proposition, alright? If it's beat up, if it's worn out, no, no, no, no, no, low value, alright? You want to make sure that the belt, if it has holes, looks good and it's not worn out. If you're moving it because you're gaining weight, you're losing weight or it's just very old, you got to upgrade it, you got to get rid of it. If it is not matching your shoes and you're wearing leather shoes, you got to do better. Guys, belts, they're casual or they're dressy. Some are fabric, some are leather. You got to make sure that when you're matching leather that the leather matches both in finish as well as texture. And what I mean by that, if you're wearing shiny black shoes, your belt needs to be shiny and black. If you're wearing a matte leather shoe, your belt needs to be matte leather. If you're wearing casual shoes, your belt needs to be a casual belt which is going to be thicker. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, you probably look low value. Earrings on dudes, low value. Just saying, the bigger the earrings, the bigger the gauges, the lower the value. I'm just being honest and I am somebody that has earrings. Alright, I forgot to mention those earlier and I needed to throw myself under the bus because I'm short on the comments by now, so he's been like, you're a dude that has earrings and you're like almost 50, I get it. I get it, I get it. Alright, the next thing is denim. Jeans, my God, are you kidding me? If those jeans are skin tight, low value. If they're big, if they're baggy, if they're falling off your ass, low value gentlemen, you gotta make sure those jeans fit you properly. Fit of the clothing, it matters. Color of the clothing, it matters. If you're wearing clothing that has a lot of pattern, this is going to basically, in my opinion, make you look a little bit funny and possibly low value. High value dudes aren't wearing a bunch of fun zany patterns. They also don't wear like fun ties or fun socks because they don't. Nobody does that's stylish or high value. Which brings me to something else and that is graphic t-shirts. Anything with graphics. If you're wearing something that has anything offensive, low value. If you're wearing anything that has like fun like leaves of things that you smoke, I'm trying to stay monetized boys. Low value, like is in like low value. The next thing that makes you look low value is not dressing age appropriate. Now, this one is a little bit nuanced because what is age appropriate? Really, it boils down to you finding a style that resonates with you regardless of the age that you are. But there are things that some dudes wear that make them look like they're trying way too hard. I'm also going to throw in like super dark jet black like hair or super dark beard on a dude who's like 80 years old. It looks ridiculous. Nothing that makes a guy look more desperate and like awkward than when you can tell he's trying like super hard to look like super young and like hip and cool. Gentlemen, you got to stop. Because it honestly makes everybody else realize that you know what? You're probably a little bit desperate and insecure about the fact that you are getting older. There's nothing wrong with age, gentlemen. It's going to happen to the best of us. But the way you age, this is optional. Take care of yourself. Work out. Take care of your skin. Use T-Shandley. And dress well. You don't need to dress super trendy. You don't need to wear super like heavy branded things to let everybody know, yo, I spent a lot of money because in my opinion, that looks desperate. And desperate looks low value. Guys, bottom line is this. You don't need a ton of cash to look like your high value. It's about wearing clothing that fits your body, that's not all wrinkled, that's not worn out, that's not stained, that is consistent with the way that you want to be perceived by others. If you do this, you look high value."

        "transcript": " So before you get it all twisted and misunderstand what this video is about and what I'm saying, I need to make it abundantly clear. I am not saying that we as men are being oppressed or oh, well, it was us. I can't believe we are. No, I'm not saying that we're men and we can handle a lot of shit and just so happens that we've got to handle the fact that society is kind of leaving us behind. And in today's world and today's world craziness, men are treated as second class citizens. All right. We've done such a good job of lifting other people up to make sure that everybody has advantages and opportunities like never before. But unfortunately, this has come at a price and a detriment to men. And this isn't just my opinion. The data supports it. Men are fucked. Let me explain. Young men are now twice as likely as women to live at home with their parents. 60% of the homeless population in the U.S. men. 90% of the prison population men. For the first time in the past 50 years, the male life expectancy rate is actually dropping. Men are twice as likely to struggle with opioid or alcohol addiction. And the male suicide rate is 3.5 times higher than women. Guys, there is a problem and it's only getting worse. Now, the question is why and what can we do about it? So the first thing that I think is going on is cultural pressures for us guys to man up, right? To be men. Men are encouraged from a very young age to be resilient, to be tough, to be stoic. Don't let them see you cry. And I think about my YouTube videos, right? The ones that I like cry on camera, you know, I made a decision to show that. And the reason was because I felt like there was a need for just regular guys to show that it's okay to show and express emotion. When I look at the comments and I see how many people are telling me that I'm not alpha, that I'm beta, or that real men don't cry, or I must be gay, or whatever it is, it makes me realize that there is still a huge problem. And the problem stems from us men not being encouraged to express ourselves or to be in touch with our emotion. The second reason why I feel like men's issues are ignored, and this is going to probably piss some of you off, but whatever, fuck it, is the whole LGTQ plus racial equality, you know, women's rights movements. And I'm not saying, and don't get it twisted. I'm not saying that that's bad or that it shouldn't happen. But because we're doing such a good job and we're focusing on lifting these groups and bringing them forward, it's basically left a lot to be desired in terms of thinking about men, their mental issues, workplace issues, the feelings of isolationism. We just don't really care about them. Like they've been good, like they've had an advantage, so let's just help these people. Let's focus on them. Let's make sure they are feeling good and have all the opportunities. You know, the other thing you just have to understand is that, you know, life in society and opportunity is not a zero sum game, right? It's not either men win and everybody else loses or everybody else wins and men lose. It shouldn't be like that. You've got to think of it more holistically. You can help everybody, but everybody includes this other gender. And when you don't do that, it basically is leaving a whole segment of the population feeling isolated and really like nobody gives a shit about us anymore. And then you want to make it worse? Let's start this whole toxic masculinity thing. Oh, that's really great for our mental health. That's really great for us dudes feeling good about ourselves. No, it basically was so front facing because the media is so twisted and social media is also twisted that we see this and we're like, wait a second, wait a second, toxic. I'm not toxic. I'm just trying to get a piece of ass. I'm just trying to make a buck. I'm just trying to not feel bad about myself and I'm trying to not feel isolated. Toxic screw that. What's that? You need somebody to dig ditches? You need somebody to go to war? You need somebody to do the heavy lifting? Oh, now we're okay, which brings me to the other reason why our issues are ignored. Men are viewed as disposable to a large extent. Again, do not get it twisted. I'm not saying woe is us as dudes. I'm simply saying you got to open your eyes, right? When there is something going on. When there's a crisis, who's going to go? Men, right? It's women and children first. This is the mentality and I'm not saying that it's wrong. Once again, I am not saying that poor us dudes, but these types of ideas do permeate to the modern day, right? When something's going on, everybody else takes a precedent. We need to help everybody else. Men, they'll be all right because they're always all right. And if they're not, well, that's okay too. So like I mentioned before, I've used therapy many times in my life and really the reason is pretty simple. It's to help me deal with an issue at the time that I'm dealing with that I'm having a difficult time getting over or past because for me, when I focus or when I'm not like good, right? I'm really not good and it prevents me from moving forward and being happy and healthy. Guys, your mental health is your responsibility. You've got to take control and you don't need to have some type of clinical issue like depression in order to utilize a therapist. Not at all. Therapy is an amazing resource and tool and better help.

If you go through my special link, guys, you're going to get a special deal on your first month of therapy. Don't wait. Now's the time because you deserve it. But what you don't deserve is the perpetuation of the masculinity myth that we see so often basically played out in movies, on television, on social media. I'm not saying that you shouldn't be resilient or tough or a stud. That's all part of being a guy, maybe, but maybe it's not. The thing that I've come to realize after being on this earth for 48 years, yes, I've old, is that there is no one size solution. And unfortunately, even though the old men of yesterday, like our grandfathers, were awesome, they also were dealing with what they were dealt. And that is not being able to talk about or encourage to talk about or share. They just had to be tough. They had to go to work. They had to come home. They didn't talk about anything. They just made sure that their family was taken care of because that's what you were expected to do. Guys, things have changed. Our world is changed. It's crazy, unfortunately. And if we don't do a better job basically connecting with one another and being okay, sharing and expressing our experiences and the things that we're dealing with, we are going to literally self-destruct. It is not by accident that we have become so emotionally distraught, not to mention so addicted to so many things. You'd think it's a coincidence that we're addicted to porn or technology or substances that we shouldn't be using as much of. But it's a coping mechanism. It's something that we do because it feels good, right? Because a lot of things that we are taught, a lot of things that we're told doesn't feel good. You know, the fact that we look at social media and we see all these dudes that we think we should idolize or emulate that have all this money, have all these cars, have all these like spicy ass women, guys like Dan Bilzerian, that is not what a man looks like in my opinion. It's not saying that a lot of dudes don't look at that and be like, oh, that would be cool. Sure, that might be cool, but that's not reality. The other thing I can tell you is what's cool is feeling good about yourself. What's good is feeling like you can talk to people about what's going on. What's good is you having deep and lasting friendships and connections, which brings me to the last part of this video. I want to talk about a few ways for you to basically get connected and feel better about yourself. Now, number one is surround yourself with people that love you. If you have people in your life that are toxic, get them the fuck out of your life, period. They don't deserve you. If there's somebody that makes you feel worse about you, get rid of them, literally. It doesn't matter if it's your parent or your brother or your girlfriend or your boyfriend, get rid of them. They don't deserve you. They don't deserve to be around you and you never are going to feel good until you do. That's something that I learned from personal experience. Number two, surround yourself with people that love you and then uplift you. Find your tribe. When you surround yourself with people that love you, that encourage you, that nurture your passions, your drive, your dreams, these are the people that are going to help you realize your potential and make you feel good about yourself. When I hang out with Antonio Centeno, when I hang out with the guys from influential media, I feel good about myself because I'm surrounded by people that love me, that get me and I get them and love them. Finding a tribe, finding people that you bond and connect with is one of the most important things that you can do. Spending all of your time online is not reality. It's also not good for you mentally. The next thing you should try to do is limit your exposure to social media and media. It is something that will cause you more stress and anxiety and once again, I know this through personal experience. The less I consume, the better I feel about myself. The other caveat is that social media and the media is crazy. But believe the hype. What they're telling you is not true. You've got to look at things more analytically, but in my opinion, you should look at them more infrequently. The less time I spend on social media or listening to the news or any type of commentary on society, the better I feel about me. What I focus on is me. What I focus on is my business. What I focus on is my community and my family. Focus your energy and efforts there. And that you can't change the world, but you can change you and the people around you. All right? You can help them. You can uplift them. You can focus on you. You can focus on your goals. You can focus on your dreams. When you do that, a lot of things start to fall in place. You're not going to be able to change the fact that people are crazy out there and it's only getting worse. But what you can change is the way that you handle it and the way that you handle yourself and the way that you internalize it. Don't believe the hype. You are fucking awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

        "transcript": " The bomber jacket. A men's style essential that every, not some, not most, every guy needs in his wardrobe because they're smooth, they're clean, they're casual and they are, most importantly, super bad ass. Today, gentlemen, I'm going over some bomber do's and don'ts to make sure that you are always looking stylish and sexy, rocking that bad ass bomber. And real quick guys, before we get into this video, if you like this bomber or this bomber or this bomber or this bomber, you can hit that link down below and grab them. It is my bomber. I should say Thursday Boot Alpha M Collaboration Bomber. No, seriously. The Alpha M Bomber and Thursday Boot Collaboration, are you kidding me? I'm not kidding you. So here's the deal. Limited run, limited edition, but Thursday Boots came to me and they're like, hey, we know that you love bomber jackets. What would you think about designing your perfect bomber? Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times. Yes, I would love to create my own bomber. So that's what we did. It's taken a year. All right, this bomber has been a year in development, but it is absolutely perfect. We went through a bunch of different designs. I eliminated that standard front zipper because honestly, that front zipper makes it a bit more casual. I also did a few other things and modifications to make it flawless. Instead of a diagonal pocket up here in the chest, typically what happens is it gets super bulky on that one side. So I put two pockets inside down here and then on the pocket, can you see it? The M? Are you kidding me? Anyway, guys, this jacket is absolute perfection and I've got a special link down below. Look at the fit, right? Nice and slim. You got two pockets there. It is the perfect bomber. Seriously, these things are so sick. Guys, not only do they look amazing, the fabric and the quality is next level. It's 6.5 ounce organic cotton, which is the best you can find. If you guys know anything about cotton, you know that is premium stuff. We also have used ribbed elastic cotton cuffs, collars and waistbands and the fit is flawless. Guys, hit the link down below if you want to check out any of the Alpha M Thursday Boot collab bombers. These things are perfect. My personal pick for the best bomber in the universe. Guys, hit the link down below. We've got a limited number, limited run. Supplies are very limited. The colors are all personally selected by me. They are clean, they are crisp, they are sexy and they are super badass. Guys, do not wait. These bombers are going to fly and they are absolute perfection, but there are a lot of bombers that aren't. So now let's go over some bomber wear and do's and don'ts to make sure that you always look badass. So the first rule to rock a bomber properly is know that it's a casual jacket. It is impossible to dress up a bomber. Even if the bomber is like leather and super shiny, in my opinion the bomber always looks best dressed down. Paired with a perfect pair of denim, maybe some badass boots or sneakers, a t-shirt or henley or a hoodie underneath and you are crushing it. The other thing you got to understand is that all bombers were not created equal in terms of style. They come in a lot of different fabrics, everything from nylon to suede, to leather, to lycra, to cotton. Typically with the bomber you are going to have a few different styling options. You are going to have a plain front like the one that I designed, no zippers anywhere, no extra pockets or patches, but a lot of bombers you are going to find are going to have this. It's a single chest pocket zipper. I think this is a great look, I think that it's fine, but it is definitely more casual. The other option that you are going to see a lot is the sleeve detail. Check out this bomber. This bomber has the sleeve zipper, it's got another place and pocket for something, I believe, pens, but it's all military inspired. That is the reason why a lot of times you are going to see bombers with a little bit of extra shit or bling on the body or the sleeve of the jacket. Since we are talking about fabrics, the next rule we just got to talk about is fake leather. Don't ever wear fake leather, period. Whether or not it's shoes or boots or jackets or bombers, fake leather looks cheap, it also doesn't cost that much less and it looks terrible. The beautiful thing with real leather guys is that as you wear it, it patinas, it ages, it breaks in and it looks a lot better. Fake plastic just rips and it looks cheap. The other reality is that there are way too many other badass fabric options when it comes to bombers. Bombers, in my opinion, have the biggest versatility in terms of fabric options. Which brings us to color and pattern. Don't wear a bomber that has a big pattern, period. Any pattern, in my opinion. The classic solid color is the way to go. Now, in terms of colors, once again, I personally feel like the muted, softer earth tones are going to be a lot better. Something that's really loud and bright and obnoxious, in my opinion, really has a tendency to kill the overall aesthetic and look. Bearing a solid color in some type of muted, soft earth tone is the way to go to look and maximize your aesthetic. Whether or not it's a green, like a far screen, amazing. The gray, one of my personal favorites, black, incredible. Or a brown or a tan, also amazing. Don't wear a jacket that's too tight, alright? If you zip it up and it literally makes you look like a sausage, you gotta size up, alright? Or if you put that jacket on and it's big and it's baggy, you may need to actually size down. When you zip up that bomber, guys, you want to make sure that it's not skin tight, but it's not super big and baggy, alright? Check out the fit. It's nice and tailored without being ultra tight. Now, this brings me to the next don't. Don't pack your pockets with a bunch of crap. If you're packing your pockets with a lot of shit, gentlemen, it's going to make you look rounder and more bubbly and baggy. And that's one of the things you want to avoid when rocking a bomber. Next up, gentlemen, let's talk about how to wear it, alright now. One of the reasons why I love a bomber jacket so much is that it's comfortable to wear all day long, even inside. And so, for me, one of my go-to looks always is a simple t-shirt underneath of a bomber jacket, right? It works incredibly well in the fall, but also in the winter. If you're living in a place that isn't like super cold, just throw on your favorite t-shirt, boom, a bomber jacket over top and you're good to go. The other thing that I love about a bomber when it comes to the collar is that you can easily wear a scarf over top of it. One of the problems with wearing a jacket that has any type of collar is the scarf. I'm a big scarf wearer. I think that it's a stylish way to stay warm in the cooler months, alright? A bomber jacket, you can simply wear the scarf any way you want and it's not going to get hung up with the collar, right? Like a denim jacket I love, but the collar does make it a little bit awkward to wear a great scarf. Personally, I am not a huge fan of wearing a button-up underneath of a bomber jacket. I just don't think the aesthetic works as well as something with a non-button front. I also don't really love polos. Personally, I am not a fan of wearing a polo underneath of a bomber. There are a lot of other jackets that are amazing with polos like sport coats or suit jackets or underneath of a sweater, but a bomber jacket has just got that like rugged, je ne sais quoi that a polo kind of effs up. The three-button Henley is one of my favorite layering options in terms of underneath of a bomber jacket, alright? It's masculine and the thing that I love so much about it is the bomber jacket in and of itself has a more rounded shape, right? Up by the collar, it's more rounded. By doing something like a v-neck or some type of shirt that has a little bit of an opening, it's actually contrasting the roundness of the collar. The turtleneck, alright? So this one is definitely a little bit more like fashion forward and I know some of you are like, yo, Alfa, I'm not feeling the turtleneck, but I'm telling you, turtlenecks are incredible. It's a lightweight turtleneck, something with like a merino wool fabric. It's not going to be too big, too bulky. It's perfect for wearing or layering underneath of a sport coat or suit to elevate the aesthetic, but it also works incredibly well underneath of a badass bomber. Favorite. This is one of my favorite looks and ways to wear a bomber jacket. You got the hoodie underneath of a bomber. It just works. Simple pair of denim, simple pair of boots or sneakers, you're killing it. But you could also elevate the aesthetic a little bit. A pair of chinos or cotton pants, you could go corduroy or you could even do some type of sweat pant or jogger, and it would still look amazing. And the other thing is that it's age-appropriate. And that's the thing. A bomber jacket is age-appropriate, whether or not you're 18 or you're 85. As long as you're not going too over the top with the extra styling or bling, it works. It works incredibly well regardless of the age you are. Another thing that I love about the bomber is that it makes you look tall. Regardless of if you're short or you're tall, it basically is perfect because it sits on your natural waist with a little cinch there as opposed to a lot of jackets that come down a little bit too far covering the crotch. They are perfect in terms of proportion. Guys, bottom line is this. Bomber jackets are something that I feel every single guy needs in his wardrobe. They just add that little bit of flair and extra sexiness to your wardrobe because any guy can wear great jeans, great shirt, great shoes, great sneakers, but it's the outerwear. It's those little extra subtle details that really make a big difference. Guys, if you want to check out any of the Alpha Bombers or grab one for yourself before they sell out, I've got that special link down below. I am so incredibly honored that Thursday, a company that I love and respect more than any other company, honestly, because of the quality, the craftsmanship, and the fair pricing that they've been offering for years, I am so honored that they would let me design my perfect bomber.

        "transcript": " So if somebody ever says to you that you look tired, this is code for old and unattractive, which is definitely not good. Today guys, I'm gonna go over a few mistakes that we as men make that make us look tired even if we're not. So yellow or discolored teeth is something that makes you look tired. So it doesn't matter the quantity or the quality of the teeth. It doesn't matter if you're missing teeth or if they're all snagly, right? If they're white, they're gonna look better, they're gonna look more attractive. But yellow and discolored teeth are one of the things that automatically make you look tired. One of my favorite products right here, the Crest Strips. They're affordable and they're fast. You wear it for about an hour a day, you do it a few days in a row and boom, those teeth are dazzling white. The second mistake that's making you look tired, which is white skin, all right? Pale and pasty skin unfortunately is something that makes you look a little bit tired. In the summertime, you're outside a little bit more. The sun, boom, you're getting a golden glow. But in the wintertime, this is definitely something that makes us look older and tired. And so one of the things that I like to recommend is possibly use some type of tinted moisturizer or some type of self-tanner to give yourself a little golden glow. Now, if you're somebody that has darker skin, if you've got brown skin, you've got black skin, you don't have to worry about this. There are a lot of incredible sunless tanners on the market that can give you a little bit of a glow without looking like an orange dude. Speaking of orange, number three is color. You're wearing the wrong color. One of the things that washes us out and makes us look tired is wearing the wrong shade, all right? So if anybody's ever been like, yo, that color looks great on you, you need to remember what it is. And then you need to wear that because that is a sign that it's making you look bright and fresh. But unfortunately, when you have or you're wearing a color that washes you out and makes you look even paler than you are, this is something that's gonna make you look tired. All right, so if you're somebody that has blonde hair, very white skin, you definitely want to avoid the whites, the really super loud and bright colors. You want to do something a little bit more muted, a little softer. If you're somebody that has a little bit darker skin, a darker complexion, you can wear those bright, loud colors and it's gonna look a lot better. Old skin, which there are a few things we gotta talk about, all right? As you age, your skin loses elasticity because of the loss of collagen. Collagen is basically like nature's goodness for helping your skin look young and sexy and fresh. But as you age, the collagen reduces and your skin starts to sag. And so something that I take along with a lot of people that I know that don't want to look old and tired is this. It's a collagen supplement. Basically, just put it in your coffee, you can put it in water, you can put it in a protein drink. You take it once a day and this is gonna give your body and your skin a little boost of collagen. All right, definitely would recommend this. The next thing we gotta talk about is your eyes because eyes are the window to you looking tired and you looking sexy, all right? Few things. Number one is your eyebrows. If your eyebrows are big and bushy, this is gonna make your eyes look heavier. The heavier your eyes, the more tired you look. Simply coming in and giving your eyebrows a little shape, cleaning them up underneath. It's basically gonna brighten your eyes up and make them look more fresh and open. The next thing is upper eyelid skin. This is something that a lot of times you are going to develop as you age, which makes you look tired. It's all about the eyes looking open and bright. And so there are things that you can do in order to reduce that. Number one is use some type of caffeinated, like eye cream or roller, in order to tighten all the skin around your eye. The next option is what is called an upper bleph surgery. This basically is going to a plastic surgeon and they will actually remove some of the skin to make your eyes look more open and a little bit younger, fresher and lighter. This is definitely something I would not recommend unless your lids are like super heavy and it really is a problem for you. The next thing is under eyes, AKA dark circles and puffiness. Those two sons of bitches are notorious for making us look tired. And so how do you get rid of them? There are a few different ways, right? The dark circles are something that really, you need to figure out why they're happening. Is it because you're not getting enough sleep? Do you have allergies or is it something else? Sometimes it can actually be genetic. So one tip I'd like to give you is cold spoons. Take two teaspoons, run them under cold water, stick them in the freezer. Wait about 10 minutes, take them out, bang. Place them on your eyes for about five minutes in order to basically allow those blood vessels to contract. It also is going to push some of the subcutaneous water out of your eyes, making them look a lot better. You can also use something like this, which is a cold compress mask that you wear. You can get these on like Amazon, they sell them everywhere. Basically you keep it in the freezer when you're ready, you take it out, you put it on, you lay with it for about 10, 15 minutes and it's gonna help everything chill out. Or you can use this. This is an ice roller, all right? These things feel amazing, but what happens is when you roll across your face with the cold compress, basically it is encouraging the blood vessels to contract, but also it helps push out some of the subcutaneous water that you're actually retaining, which is one of the big reasons why you actually look puffy. It's water retention, which brings me to the next mistake that makes you look tired and that is not drinking enough water. Water is one of the things that you need to consume in order to flush all the toxins and keep your skin hydrated and healthy, which brings me to the next mistake and that is not having good skin, AKA dry, old, wrinkled or ashy. Truth is guys, out of all the mistakes that we make that make us look tired and old, this one is the easiest to correct and fix, all right? T. Shanley, it's my company. You guys have all heard of it a gazillion times and the reason why I wanna tell you about it real quick is that it is one of the quickest, easiest things that you can do to have a dramatic impact on your face, your complexion and your confidence.

It's a huge handsomeness and skincare, no brainer. Smoking, if you're smoking, like if you're smoking in 2024, like what are you doing? Like seriously, what are you doing? Everybody knows it's Banffry, everybody knows it makes you look tired and old because it prematurely ages your skin. It also jacks up your teeth, makes them yellow, unsexy and definitely not good. And did I mention your breath? Your breath stinks. And I'm not saying your breath is making you look tired, but it definitely is making other people go, oh my God, his breath stinks. I don't wanna make out with him, I don't wanna talk to him. I don't wanna get close to him because he's got horrible halitosis. Diet, what you eat, what you consume is impacting the way that you look. It just is, you should know that, but I'm gonna reiterate the fact that if you're eating a diet that's high in shit food, it's gonna do a lot of bad things to your body. A, you're gonna get man boobs, doesn't make you look tired, but it definitely makes you look sloppy. All right, the other thing it really does though is it makes you retain water. When you are retaining water in your face, subcutaneous water, subcutaneous water on your body, it makes you look puffy, it makes you look unrested, it makes you look unwell. When you actually increase the amount of good foods you're eating, more incredible carbohydrates, more incredible lean protein, more incredible fibrous carbs, your body is not gonna retain as much water. You combine this with the fact that you're drinking more water like we talked about a little bit earlier and all of a sudden things start to flush out. As they flush out, you start to lean out. Not only do you lean out, your skin is gonna look better. If you're eating a diet that's high in shit food, lots of processed nonsense, you're probably gonna have oily skin, you're probably gonna have blackheads, you're probably not gonna look good because the fact is crap food makes you look like crap. Bonus, I got two bonus tips that are probably why you don't feel good, you also don't look super great. All right, number one is you're not exercising. When you don't exercise, when you're not sweating, when you're not working out, when you're not lifting heavy crap, your body doesn't feel good, but you also don't look as good. When I work out, I feel fresh, I feel alive in my skin, it's just as healthier because when you sweat, this basically helps your body get rid of toxins. And so sitting in a sauna, another bonus for you guys that wanna look super sexy. And number two is posture. Posture has a dramatic impact on the way that you are perceived. And if you have bad posture, if you're all hunched over, you're not standing up, you're not walking with confidence, right? Your shoulders aren't back, your chest isn't up, your head isn't up, you don't look confident. You also don't look rested and like, honestly, you feel good. And so one quick thing that you can do in order to instantly improve how alert you look, how fresh you look, how confident is stand up and walk with purpose and presence. Guys, it's all about a powerful presence. If you have one, good news, you're not only gonna look well rested, you are gonna look sexy as hell."

        "transcript": " Alright, before we get started with this video, I've got a question for you. What is the difference between a blazer and a sport coat? You know? Probably not. Well, today, after this video, you will. You also will know how to properly wear both of them, because I'm going to go over some blazer and sport coat wearing rules that every guy needs to follow. But then the second part of this video, you need to stick around for, because I'm going to show you some of my favorite sport coat and blazer combinations to always look sexy. It's a rule number one is know the difference between a blazer and a sport coat. It's pretty simple. A blazer, like I'm wearing, is a jacket that is solid in color. The fabric is solid. Alright? It could be navy. It could be green. It could be red. It could be black. A sport coat, on the other hand, is a jacket that has a pattern or a supple, rich texture. So if a jacket has a pattern, whether or not it's subtle or a little bit more bold, or it has a very rich or heavy texture, that is a sport coat. Alright? Let me ask you a question. What about this? Alright? What about this? What about a jacket? What is it? Exactly. It's a blazer because it is solid in color. Now, a blazer can have, alright, standard buttons, whether or not they are horn or they're plastic, or sometimes you'll see them with metal, gold or silver. In my opinion, the gold and silver metal blazer is a little bit dated. It's a little bit old money, but in my opinion, a navy or black blazer is something that every guy should invest in. What about this? Is it a blazer or a sport coat? Another question. It's actually a suit jacket, which we'll talk about in a second. Alright? What about this one? Alright? Look at the pattern. Okay, exactly. It's also a suit jacket, but if it didn't have pants, these two would be considered sport coats because of the pattern and the texture. Now this brings me to the next question. Can you wear a suit jacket as a blazer or a sport coat? Maybe. It depends. Usually not, but sometimes. And I'm going to explain what I mean. Generally speaking, if you buy a suit, which this is a suit, look how shiny it is. The fabric is. When you wear a suit jacket that has a little bit more of a sheen or a shine, it looks like a suit jacket and doesn't work as well when you dress it down with a pair of slacks or jeans. The peak lapel that you're going to find on a lot of suits also doesn't look as good when it comes to pairing with denim jeans, which I'm going to show you how to do a little bit later, or some type of casual slack. Alright? In my opinion, your sport coat should have a notch lapel in order to maximize its sexiness. But this suit jacket, in my opinion, would look fine, broken up and worn with a pair of denim or some type of light cotton pant. Alright? A few reasons for that. Number one, you've got the notch lapel. Number two, the fabric. It's not super shiny. It's got a little bit of texture, which makes it a bit more casual. Now that being said, they are making a lot more sport coats that are a little bit more elevated and refined in terms of the styling. Right? You've got, or you're seeing a lot more double breasted sport coats with the peak lapel. A lot of fun, vibrant patterns. And I think these definitely work, but you've got to know what you're doing. Alright? The next thing we've got to talk about is this shirt. Alright? In my opinion, the clean, crisp, white polo or button down always looks amazing. The crisp, clean, white button down shirt or polo shirt, guys, in my opinion, is a must have for every dude, but it also works incredibly well underneath of a blazer or a sport coat. Now, something I want to talk about real quick is patterns. The reason why I think the blazer is a bit more superior in terms of versatility as opposed to a sport coat is the fact that it is a solid pattern, which means you can wear a pattern shirt underneath it or pattern pants and it's going to look a lot better. Now, in terms of what polos work underneath of a sport coat or blazer or even a suit, it's got to be an elevated polo. Alright? Not your daddy's like standard polo with some like whack ass collar. Alright? This is a cotton peak polo, but notice the collar, right? It's a little bit more like cut out. It's standing up nice and rigid and the fit is flawless. This is actually from Collars & Co. Collars & Co also has some premium polos that have a dress shirt collar, a deeper placket, which means it's going to look super sexy and refined. Let me show you. Check out the collar, right? Crisp, clean, upright. The placket, deeper, the fabric, a little bit shiny, a little stretchy, which means it's an elevated aesthetic and that's a thing that's so hard to find and that is a polo shirt that looks amazing underneath of a sport coat, a jacket or a suit. The first time I heard about this company, I was watching Shark Tank and it blew my mind. I was like, finally, somebody is solving the problem. And apparently Mark Cuban thought the same thing because he literally invested over a million dollars in this perfect polo company. But they have a lot more than polos, alright? This blazer that you've been seeing me wearing also from Collars & Co. And it is my favorite and there are a few reasons for that, alright? Number one, the fabric. It's super stretchy. It also doesn't get wrinkled. So you literally could be on a business trip or going on a date, have this thing wadded up like in your bag or in your car and your spicy sandwich is like, I got reservations to a nice restaurant and we're like, really? I'm gonna look good. So bang! You grab your Collars & Co. blazer, you throw that bad boy on and you are ready to rock and you're killing it. Alright, bang, exactly. Now the other cool thing is the fit. These blazers are perfect. Not too big, not too boxy, not too baggy. Nice and slim without being like skin tight. They work, they look amazing. Guys, if you have not grabbed yourself one of these blazers, whether or not it's in blue, it's in black or any of the other colors, I want you to hit that link down below. Collars & Co. is crushing it in terms of refining the male wardrobe. Whether or not it's polos or these great jackets, they also have sweaters that are incredible and the price is awesome. And with that discount code, if you go through my link, it gets even more affordable. Guys, do not wait. Collars & Co. is the greatest polo you will ever wear. They've got a bunch of different patterns, a bunch of different color options, a bunch of different looks. But what if you want to wear a different colored shirt other than like a white or a solid color underneath of a blazer sport coat? So once again, if you're wearing a blazer, you can wear a patterned shirt underneath it and it's going to look epically sexy. Now, if you're wearing a sport coat that does have some type of pattern, this is where the nuance comes in. You really got to make sure you understand how to combine patterns or else it can look a little bit weird. All right. If your jacket has a, say, a grid pattern on it or some type of Glen plaid and it's real tight and real small and real subtle, you don't want to wear like a super thin patterned shirt. You would wear something that's a little bit bigger, a little bit more bold, like a gingham or something of that effect. All right. Now, if you're like, wait, gingham, Glen plaid, what the hell is he talking about? Stick to solids. Next up, we got to talk about pants. We're going to start with jeans and denim because this is where a lot of guys screw things up, right? I've got three different colors of denim here. All right. If I was wearing this navy jacket, which color would I not wear? All right. For those of you who said this dark navy because it's too close to the jacket, you would be correct. If you said this jean would look the best, you would probably be right. It would also, though, make the outfit a bit more casual, right? The lighter the jean, all right, the more casual the outfit is going to be. If you're going to be wearing a navy jacket, do not wear navy pants with that jacket. And the reason is pretty simple. It's going to make you look like you're trying to make a suit of two items that is not a suit. Same thing goes for black. If you're wearing a black jacket, don't wear black pants. Go for a suit. If you're going to be wearing something that matches that much, go with the suit. Some other colors that would work are right here, right? You've got the green with this would look amazing. The tan also incredible. Or the light gray that I'm wearing also great. Next rule we got to talk about is the shoes that you're wearing, all right? So number one, if you're going to be wearing jeans, you want to make sure that you're wearing a little bit more of a casual shoe. And what I mean by that is not super high shine. Typically, what I notice is when I see a guy and he's trying to like dress up jeans with a sport coat and he's wearing like a super shiny black like Oxford or lace up, it looks a little bit funny. But when he's wearing a leather that has a more matte finish, in my opinion, this looks a lot better. Something else that always looks good is a pair of simple loafers, all right? Lofers are a great addition to every wardrobe. They work great with jeans. They work great with slacks or chinos. And they also pair perfectly with blazers or sport coats. Now let's talk about sneakers. If you are going to be rocking sneakers with a blazer or sport coat, it is acceptable if the overall aesthetic is a more casual vibe. The white minimal leather sneaker, black leather sneaker is acceptable, all right? In terms of like Jordans or something more fun and funky, I would probably avoid it. And that's it. Those are the basic rules you need to follow in order to always knock it out of the park when it comes to wearing a blazer or sport coat. Now, why don't I show you some of my favorite outfits, all right? So this one that I'm wearing is one of my go-tos, all right? It's these gray pants I absolutely love. I've got these brown loafers. I've got a white polo. And then I've got the navy blazer, all right? In my opinion, this is clean, more old-money aesthetic, and it looks sexy as hell. But throwing a gray pair of denim and boom, you're ready for action, gentlemen. This is a great date night outfit, right? You're going to a nice restaurant. You don't want to just wear like a polo and jeans or a button-up and jeans. Throw on a sport coat, all right? Some great shoes. It's a great way to elevate the aesthetic. This is how you properly rock jeans and a blazer. But check it out. The next outfit, I'm wearing the black blazer, black polo, green pants, black shoes. It's crisp. It's clean. It's so sexy. In my opinion, wearing a black sport coat or blazer with a black shirt underneath also is another great way to really elevate the aesthetic. You also kind of look like a badass. Next level, bad boy style. All right, you asked for it. Here we go, right? Chelsea boots, denim, turtleneck blazer. What do you think? It's clean. It's classy. It's elevated and refined. Now, a little pro tip. This holiday season or whenever you're like going to a party, if you rock a turtleneck underneath of a suit or a blazer, it's next level sexy. In my opinion, going monochromatic even better. But check it out. You want to change up the look, right? Go with a pair of gray chinos, black turtleneck, black blazer, black boots. You're killing it. And the last outfit is one of my favorite springtime, summertime looks, right? It's old money, like just sexiness. You've got the light colored pants, the white polo with the navy jacket, right? This is actually the outfit I wore when I recently went to the Cloyster on Sea Island. It's a super bougie, like old money hotel and resort. And everything there, you need to wear a jacket for in terms of restaurants. And so I brought this jacket. I had this outfit and I was literally the best dressed guy on the resort. I got tons of compliments. I felt amazing and I looked incredible. Guys, the blazer, the sport coat, a men's style essential that you need to rock. After this video, you know how to rock it properly."

        "transcript": " I wasted so much money on clothing that I just didn't wear or I thought at the time was a goodbye when the reality is it was terrible. Today guys, I want to go over a few items that in my opinion you should never waste money on. So number one is white t-shirts. I am a firm believer. Do not spend a lot of money on white t-shirts. It's a waste. Why? Well, a few reasons. Number one, they always get pit stains eventually. Number two, if you buy a high-end t-shirt, right? I have bought some expensive t-shirts, right? This is a brand All Saints and what happened is when I put it on I was like, oh, it's so soft, it's so supple, it feels amazing against my nipples, right? The problem is that the fabric wears out after literally like four washes. The other problem is that it gets typically like a little bit beat up and old looking fast, alright? This t-shirt that I'm rocking here, I got from the J Crew Outlet three years ago. It still fits great. It looks good and it only costs like 15 bucks. Number two is expensive designer sneakers. Alright, so here's the deal. Even though at the time they may be like cool or on trend, the fact is they are always really expensive, overpriced. The quality isn't the greatest, but typically they're going to be ugly. And the problem with this is that they may be on trend now, but in like six months you're never going to wear them and you literally wasted hundreds and hundreds of dollars. The next thing I want to talk about is non-leather shoes. Never buy fake leather. Whether not it's shoes or sneakers or boots or leather jackets. Never buy fake leather. Alright, why? Well, a few reasons for that. Number one, it wears out really fast. Number two, it looks cheap. Number three, it's literally a complete waste of money because you're not going to really love it. It's going to wear out. It's not going to look good. And the truth is that it's not that much less expensive than the real deal. Now I'm not saying to go like overboard or over the top in terms of your spending. You've got to make sure that you stretch to the highest level of quality you can afford when it comes to buying items. A suit. Not every suit is a waste of money. Quite the opposite. Cheap suits, these in my opinion are a waste of money. If you're going into a department store, you're buying something like off the rack or going into like a Joseph A. Banks, right? You put it on, right? It doesn't fit all that great. Typically it's going to be a little bit boxy. It's going to look cheap. Or if you go to a place like H&M or one of these like fast fashion stores, it's a complete waste of money. What I would do personally is spend a little bit of extra money to go to a place like Suit Supply or Indochino and get yourself a proper suit. Investing a little bit of extra money in buying a higher quality suit that was tailored for you is worth the investment in my opinion. If you're buying something that's cheap, that doesn't fit you, that's boxier baggy, it looks cheap, it looks like shit and it's a complete waste of money. Instead, I'd spend a few extra hundred dollars to buy a good suit, alright? It's going to have non-plastic buttons, it's going to have functioning buttonholes, it's going to be a higher quality garment that you are going to love. Watches. Number one, never buy a fake luxury watch. Never buy a counterfeit, period. Alright, I did. I made the mistake. I spent a few hundred dollars. I went to New York. I went to Canal Street. I saw a fake Rolex that I really liked. I was like, oh, it's awesome and I bought it. What I should have done is taken that like $300 and bought a quality timepiece. Alright? The fact is guys, watches are one of the greatest investments you can possibly make in terms of your style and the per wear cost is insane, right? If you spend a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars on a piece that you absolutely love, you're going to wear it every single day and so the per wear cost gets like super affordable. The reality is that there are way too many bad ass affordable watches out there on the market that are incredible timepieces that aren't counterfeit that you're going to love, right? A brand that I absolutely love guys is the company Aura. I've talked about them before. Look how sexy that is, right? Stainless steel, sapphire crystal, alright? It's an automatic inside, right? Japanese Seiko movement, super premium watches and the price is insane. By insane, I mean crazy insane, especially right now with a 50% off discount. Guys, it's for a very limited time. If you're somebody that is ready to treat yourself or the dude in your life, whether or not it's your brother, your weird uncle Barry, your dad, an amazing, beautiful timepiece that he's going to love right now for a limited time, if you use the code alpha M, you're going to get 50% off. This also includes the 41 millimeter Rs that are already discounted, which means you can grab an automatic watch for under $100. It is a huge watch, no brainer. Guys, this deal is not going to last. Neither is the supply. So if you're interested, do not wait. Check it out. Here's another one that I bought that I absolutely love, right? Stainless steel, the white face, clean minimal. Once again, you've got that open case back. You've got a butterfly clasp. It's another one that I love, right? All black. Are you kidding me? It is so sexy. Murdered out. Sapphire crystal. Like I said, guys, these watches are next level in terms of the quality for the price that they're charging. All right, they basically started back in 2023. I saw an article about them and I was like, yo, these watches look insane. Everybody in the watch world is freaking out over this company and this brand. Here's another one that I love. It's skeletonized, right? The rose gold, the rubber strap. You can mix, you can match the different straps with the different watches and have a few different looks, a few different watches, and you're absolutely going to love it. Bottom line is this. Watches are an amazing accessory, in my opinion, they're the best accessory. And if you're somebody that wants to grab and treat yourself to an incredible accessory that you're absolutely going to love that is not going to break the bank, I want you to hit that special link down below. Like I said, right now for a very limited time and while supplies last, they're doing a 50% off site-wide sale. Next thing we got to talk about is denim, gentlemen. All right, so I have bought super expensive premium jeans before. All right. And I would not recommend it. I feel that it is a waste of money. I have also bought super cheap jeans as well from American Eagle or the Gap or Medanri Public or Levi's, right? And they have been honestly better jeans. These are my favorite pair of jeans, all right? I bought two pairs, I love them so much. They're from American Eagle. All right, all those old expensive jeans that I had, I threw out. For one, they weren't in style anymore and that's one of the dangers of buying trendy items. Whether or not it's a trendy fit or a trendy color or overly distressed or super skinny, you know that the trend is going to change. Styles change. This is inevitable, right? And so if you're investing or buying a bunch of different items that are super expensive that are some extreme fit, like super skinny, super tight, super big, super boxy, super baggy, you know that in like six months it's going to be out of style, which is the next thing I'd say don't waste money on. And that is oversized trends. All right? Whether or not it's an oversized t-shirt, an oversized sweatshirt, oversized pants or sweatpants, you know, and literally five, actually wait a second, nope, sorry, three months from now it's going to be out of style. Sunglasses. Shades, all right, so here's the deal. I love me some good sunglasses. I also used to have a little bit of an addiction to super premium sunglasses, all right? A brand that I loved was this company called RetroSpecs. All right, I also love the brand Dita. And then I decided to start the brand Enemy. And when I did this, I basically started doing my research. And what I've come to realize is that when you go into a store like Solstice or Sun Class Hot or any like designer store that sells like designer glasses, you are absolutely getting better over, right, and given the business. And I'm not talking about the good kind. It is the biggest racket in the history of apparel. Sunglasses are insane in terms of the markup. All right? My quality pair of sunglasses, the cost to make them is probably going to be around $15. And what they charge you sometimes is $2, $3, $4, $500. In my opinion, you can never go wrong with a good pair of solid Ray-Bans. They always offer you a good value for the price and the quality, not to mention the styling. But there are a lot of other great brands as well. You don't need to spend a ton of cash on good shades in order to look cool, right? There are a lot of great sunglasses that are in the $50, $60, $70 price range so you don't get bent over and given the business. Expensive Cologne is also a huge waste of money in my opinion. All right? Once again, when I develop my own, I realize, oh shit, this stuff costs like $5 and they're charging $3, $4, $5, $600. Guys, the other reality is that there are so many incredible fragrances out there on the market that smell insanely sexy. They're literally like $50, $60, $70. America Voyage is like the cheapest cologne out there on the market but it really smells good. It's like $20 a bottle, right? Some other ones that I absolutely love is Mont Blanc. They make incredibly sexy smelling fragrances that are definitely not going to break the bank. But there are a lot of other amazing fragrances out there that are all like under that $100 price point. Find one that you love, rock it and smell sexy as hell. Expensive Bags. All right? This one was actually a gift from a friend of mine. He had alpha engraved on this like to me bag, right? This bag was like hundreds of dollars. And when I saw it, I was like, oh, that's awesome. But the deal is guys, all of these really expensive like duffel bags that you see in my opinion are kind of a waste of money because A, they're expensive. B, they're not very functional. Right? If you're going on a trip and you've got to like go and do like planes and all that stuff, you don't want to be lugging around a 50, 60, 70 pound duffel bag on your shoulder. Instead, get a solid suitcase, invest in luggage with like the little roller wheels, right? It's a lot more functional. It's also in my opinion, a better way to spend money. Shirts. We're clothing with big logos on them. Whether or not it's a sweatshirt, a t-shirt, pants, you name it, a jacket, like if it's got a brand name on it, it is definitely not something that I would waste my money on. Because in my opinion, it's not going to be as versatile. You also know every single time somebody wears that thing with that logo that they're wearing that like same item. The other reality is that a lot of times these branded shirts look a little bit tacky. And last but certainly not least, the last item you should never waste money on is any item that you won't wear. You got to start being more honest with yourself when you're shopping. Or at least I should say I need to be more honest with myself. I am notorious for going into a store, seeing something and being like, yeah, I love that. That's awesome. Oh, I love it. It's so awesome. I'm going to wear it. I'm going to love it. I'm going to rock it and guess what? I get it home and I don't. You've got to be honest with yourself in terms of, you know your tendencies and your habits. If you buy something and it's in your wardrobe and you're not wearing it, it is a huge waste of money. It's also a huge waste of space because as you can see from this disaster, I haven't gone through my stuff. I need to. Don't yell at me. Don't judge me. I feel you judging me. It's a waste of space. And if you're going to have a bunch of crap that you literally haven't worn in three years like why have it there? It's literally impossible to operate a wardrobe effectively and efficiently if you've got a bunch of chaos and clutter. All right. If you're like most guys, including myself, you have a tendency to collect and hold on to things. It feels amazing when you go through and you purge. What I'd recommend guys is once a season or once a year, go through your wardrobe and throw out or I should say donate the items that you haven't worn. You're not going to wear them in the next six months or next year if you haven't in the previous six or 12 months. Guys, it's about having a lean, mean wardrobe that you love to wear. This is how you're going to save money and also look amazing."

        "transcript": " So today's video is gonna make me sound probably pretty uncool, and like an old man, but it's come to my attention recently that I am, an old man. And with age comes a little bit of wisdom. I grew up in a very different time than you guys did, a lot of you guys. Things were different, things were simpler. We didn't have the internet when I was growing up. When I started to have sex, it was a different time. And that's really what I wanna talk about today, because the direction of this channel moving forward really is, it's all about helping you. And if there's something that I feel I just wanna get off my chest or I wanna talk about because I feel it's important and it could potentially change at least one person's life, I feel like it's important for me to talk about it. And so today I wanna talk about, I wanna talk about sex. Because it's one of those things that when I look around and I see how casual and nonchalant it's become, it scares the shit out of me for you. The goal with this video is pretty simple. To help open your eyes and also help you stop doing some of the potentially devastating and self-destructive things that you've been doing. So the first thing I would just like to mention is it is a big deal to have it. It's not just no big deal, even though it's been basically sensationalized and it's been made to be like no big thing to go and sleep with a bunch of people. It is a big deal. Number one, I just wanna say, if you are gonna be having it, you need to make sure you're protected. And the reason is pretty simple. You don't wanna have a kid if you don't wanna have a kid. Now, we're gonna talk about STDs in a second, but the whole thing about you having it with somebody, even if they're like, hey, I'm on the pill, don't believe the hype, you are responsible for protecting yourself. Protection also is what you need to do in order to reduce the risk. You can't eliminate it other than abstinence. That's the only way you're gonna eliminate the risk of contracting something. But if you wanna not get an STD, you gotta protect yourself. Wear a condom. That is what protecting yourself actually means. Even though a lot of dudes are like, yo, but it doesn't feel as good, whatever, it feels good enough. What doesn't feel good is when you go to take a pee and it burns like razor blades coming out of your pee hole. What doesn't feel good is chlamydia or gynaurea. What doesn't feel good is itching because you got crabs. What doesn't feel good is getting a diagnosis of something like syphilis or some other disease like herpes that basically you've got for the rest of your life. Guys, the reality is this, STDs are on the rise. And the reason is because everybody is a slut these days, which brings me to the next thing I just want you to know. Don't be a slut, don't date a slut, period. And I'm not even given the double standard and oh, it's, no, no, I'm talking about you, I'm talking about her. Why would you wanna be with somebody that's been with 50, 60, 100 people? Why? Like why? Because that's not gonna be an issue for you later in the future when you're like, how many people you've been with? She's like a hundred, right? Or she says to you, how many people have you been with? And you're like, a hundred. You think that makes somebody feel good? You think that makes somebody feel like, oh, they're super desirable or they were able to get this much and so they must be a good catch. No, it makes you a horrible catch in my opinion. It makes you void of a moral compass. And I'm not saying that sleeping with a bunch of people makes you a bad person, I'm just saying it makes you a slut. Now, some of you are like, yo, good news, I just watched porn. Buckle up, cause we're gonna talk about that next. The first thing I just need you to know is that it's not reality. What you see on the movies, what you see on the different sites, not reality. It's not the way that you should act towards somebody, it's not the way that somebody's gonna respond to you, it's not the way that you are probably built. And what I mean by that is like you're big Al, right? And I know because when I was like 12 years old, I stumbled in, I didn't stumble. I snooped through my stepdad's drawer, I found a tape. 12 year old me go snooping, I'm like, woo, a tape, what's this? I knew what it was, I put it in. And sure enough, that one action of me snooping and finding and watching at 12 years old totally f-up my brain and my perception of myself in terms of my body image for the rest of my life. Because I saw what was on that movie and I saw this dude and I was like, yo, I'm not built like that. I felt like I was deformed because I wasn't that dude. And that started my lifetime of insecurity about my body, which is another downside to watching the movies. All men were not created equal when it comes to the size of big Al. This is something that you're probably ultra aware of. Now, the one thing I can tell you, if you are somebody that is struggling or you want your big Al to be bigger, I just wanna real quick mention something that I've talked about a bunch of times that has been a game changer for me. And that is the bathmate, all right? The bathmate, this pump. This is the bathmate hydro extreme. It's got this little pump. This is the top of the line model. I'm gonna have a special link down below. That link is going to take you to my landing page. They are today's video sponsor. They're also something that has changed my life and the way that I view myself. Not to mention, I last longer and I'm much bigger and thicker as a result of using this for over a year. I, like I said, have always been insecure about my size. And so I've done a bunch of videos talking about natural ways to enhance your X, Y, and Z. Take L-Arginine, which works to make it harder and thicker and all that good stuff. But I started to really go down the rabbit hole of what are the real options to actually make you physically large or not just like harder. So I did a bunch of research and, you know, there are a lot of different surgical options that I was definitely not interested in, like the sleeve, the Pneuma, you know, extenders. Like there are a lot of dangerous methods out there that a lot of people weren't happy with. The thing that I kept coming back with or two were these pumps. I saw a video by Derek from More Plates More Dates talking about this pump specifically and I decided to reach out and give it a try. So long story short, I placed my order. I get three different models. I get all three, right? I get the Hydro, the HydroMax, and the Hydro Extreme. I tested all three and this is the one you want, all right? The amount of suction and pressure you get when you actually use this little ball as opposed to just like pumping it against your body is next level, all right? This is the one you want if you're serious about making a change. Now I'm not saying you need it, but if you do or you want it, I've got that link down below. It's gonna give you right now an insane deal, all right? These things are not a toy. They're also not like super cheap. They are a device that will literally help you be bigger and the way that they work real quick, little lesson is what happens is when you get like him hard, right? You've got these two like spongy, like cavernous chambers inside. They fill with blood, all right? The more blood that comes in, these chambers, the bigger you're gonna get. Well, the whole idea in premise is that this is kind of like working out like in the gym, right? The more you do bicep curls, the more you force blood into the muscle, the bigger it gets, it micro tears, the little fibers in your muscles and then it rebuilds bigger, stronger and sexier, right? Same sort of principle with this. You fill it up with water in the shower, you put it on your body and you pump it, right? You fill it up and what's happening is it is drawing extra, or I should say more blood into those two spongy chambers. Pools, more blood into those chambers stretching them out, all right? And over time of using this, it literally like permanently makes things bigger. The more blood that's able to flow into your big out, the bigger he's gonna be. Now for me, I gained a bit of length, but the biggest difference was thickness or conference. I got a lot thicker by using this. I've used it now for over a year, now I use it basically twice a week. It's more of like a maintenance dose or a maintenance workout. Think of it just like working out in the gym. You do sets, you do reps, I've done a bunch of videos talking about it. I'm gonna link to my 30 day, 60 day and 90 day videos down below if you guys are interested in going to find out more about this or having a more sort of detailed deep dive into the whole penis pump realm. Guys, this bad boy, it works 100% and it's not just my opinion. If you are somebody that wants a bigger wiener, it will do it, but it takes time. It's also not a quick fix. And you also need to understand that this is not a toy, all right? You can hurt yourself by using this improperly. You can also hurt yourself by overdoing it, which is something I did the first time I used it. I'm like, let me just see if I can get like a little bigger and I ended up getting some swelling and a little bit of bruising. It went away, of course, but you gotta be careful. Start slow, gradually you build up. And I'm telling you, this thing has changed. I feel like this thing has changed my life. I feel more confident about myself. My sex life has gotten better with my wife. She enjoys the bigger me a lot more. And even though before she was like, oh no, you're good, you're fine, you're totally amazing and totally, yeah, right. She's probably not gonna tell you like, oh, I wish it was bigger, I wish it was thicker, you're not as big as my ex-boyfriend. She's not gonna tell you that because she knows that his men or egos are pretty fragile, especially when it comes to our wieners. And so guys, if you're interested, I've got that special link right now. Like I said, huge deal, huge savings. If you're interested in grabbing it, do not wait, but don't mess around with those other two models. Get this one. This is the top of the line, but with that discount, it's super affordable and it works. A few other reasons why watching the movies is bad for your confidence is it lowers your self-esteem. And the reason is because you know it's not good for you. You know you shouldn't be doing it. You know that there are better uses of your time, but you go back and you do it. And afterwards, you feel guilty about doing it until the next time. The other problem is the dopamine. You know, we talk a lot about dopamine and the fact that we are getting so much of it now and it affects more than ever, it affects every aspect of your life. Whether or not you realize it or not, when you don't have the proper dopamine response of the proper things, it f's you up. When I quit, a lot of things kind of fell into place for me. I was more attentive and had a better relationship with my wife because we were more engaged because I wasn't basically taking care of myself, watching. It made me be a better husband, a better partner. I think that's why I'm doing it. I'm doing it because I want to be more attentive and I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive and more attentive to what I'm doing. I want to be more attentive and more attentive to use it as in like it as a weapon or as a reward. That is not a healthy relationship. You've got to understand that if you are with somebody and they don't want it as much as you or it's just not like the same, like in terms of your freak is different than their freak, it's probably not going to work. You need to be on the same page with somebody that is going to be your partner long-term. Now, it doesn't mean that it's not going to slow down because news flash as you're with somebody, or I should say the longer you're with somebody, the frequency will slow down. You also are going to lose that initial like butterflies and oh my God, it's so exciting. Like that intensity, it goes away or it greatly reduces. Do not think that there's anything wrong with you or there's anything wrong with them. It's just the natural evolution of relations. All right, what you thought when you were younger was like the most important thing in terms of, you know, getting this and doing that. A lot of times your perception and your needs will change as you get older. It's not saying that you don't want to have it when you're older, but you value other things. The next thing I just want to mention is don't be fooled by beauty. All right, beauty is one of those things that is an appreciating asset. She is and he is and you are going to get less attractive typically as you age. All right, and if you are just focused on somebody because they're beautiful or they're attractive physically, you're gonna be sorely disappointed and be searching for something in the future. You've got to find somebody that you think and find beautiful on the outside and inside. And when you connect with somebody and have a relation and have intimacy with somebody that you're truly connected to, I can tell you from experience, it gets so much better. It also gets a lot easier in terms of, you don't need to feel like you've got to put on an actor, a show, or you don't need to live up to some arbitrary set of standards. Now, it doesn't mean that you need to get lazy, which is the next thing we got to talk about. One of the big complaints and reasons why relationships end that are typically like pretty good is that one or two or both people get lazy in the relationship. In the early days, you're telling her she's beautiful. In the early days, you're doing all the things that you need to do in order to basically make her feel beautiful about herself and make her want to be intimate with you. But if you stop, if you just basically stop engaging, if you stop making her feel special or beautiful or doing the little things, your relationship will fail. If you stop doing the little things you need to do in order to basically facilitate the action, make her feel beautiful doing the things, the foreplay, the dirty talk, all the little nasty naughty things you did when you were first dating, you got to keep doing it. Yes, the frequency will slow down. This is normal. Don't think that there's something wrong with her or you, but communication is a beautiful thing. And the last thing I'd just like to mention, when it comes to the act of physical intimacy, it's nobody's fucking business who you choose to love or where you choose to stick your wiener, as long as it's legal. Like seriously, it's nobody's business. There's nothing wrong with you for being a little freaky. There's nothing wrong with you for being a little bit weird. There's nothing wrong with you for being gay, for being straight, for loving who you love. And if you are somebody that gets off on having multiple people in a relationship, like that's your business. Do not let anybody tell you differently or that it's not okay. It doesn't matter. It's not up to them. It's up to you. And I want you to have a happy, healthy action life, but it starts with you not taking it for granted and acting like it's no big deal, because I can tell you it is a very big deal. I know I sound like the fun police. I know I sound like probably your parents. Actually, I hope you're lucky enough to have a parent that would tell you things like this and have an open, honest conversation about something so incredibly deadly important as this. But the fact is you need to hear it. You also need to change your perception. Just because you see that other people are doing something or you see that it's normal, it doesn't mean it's okay. Protect yourself. Do better, gentlemen. Do better."

        "transcript": " Now I know what you're thinking, you're like, yo, nice guy, I thought it wasn't good to be a nice guy. Well, the truth is there are two different types of nice guys, knowing the difference is critical, all right, because there is a type of nice guy that we're gonna actually outline in this video that possesses some traits that women absolutely desire and crave. The first type is the toxic nice guy. You guys all know what the nice guy syndrome is, right? It's basically a dude that's overly accommodating, he's overly nice, he's overly kind. The toxic nice guy is always putting somebody else's needs in front of his own and the reason is because he thinks by doing this, people are gonna like him more, people are going to basically do things for him eventually. When the reality is nobody treats him well and the reason is because nobody respects him. It literally is impossible to respect somebody who is a doormat. Women can pick up on this, they got like an 18th sense when it comes to dudes that are just simping or being nice because they think they're gonna get something from it, this is absolutely a total turn off. The alternative is what I call the masculine nice guy. This is a guy that shows kindness, but he also shows strength, he shows assertiveness, he takes control of situations, but he's able to give of himself. Now, the truth is there are some characteristics that this dude possesses that are absolutely irresistible to women and today I'm gonna go over those five traits that you need to have. The first trait is genuine kindness without an agenda. This one is one of the most attractive traits that a man can possess. Instead of you going around doing things for people because you think you're gonna get something, a genuine kind person is doing things just because it's the right thing to do. Some examples of this is holding the door for somebody, giving up your seat, saying please, saying thank you, helping out a stranger or a friend just because they need it. Authenticity, a genuinely masculine nice guy is authentic in his kindness. Number two is self-assuredness, confidence with humility. Did you hear that? That's a big thing. A lot of men put on an act of confidence. They're trying to show the world or prove to somebody else that they are good, they're worthy. A self-assured man knows his value. He's not trying to act like his shit doesn't stink because he knows everybody's shit stinks, but he's confident. He also exercise humility. It's about knowing your strengths and owning your flaws. This is one of the sexiest things a human can possess. Everybody likes to be around somebody that can basically make fun of themselves or doesn't take themselves too seriously, but it doesn't mean that you're putting yourself down all the time just to basically get people to laugh at you. There's a big difference. It's about being competent in who you are, not showcasing it, not bragging, but also owning the imperfections that are so incredible. Number three is assertiveness. Setting boundaries. This is something that nice guys, the toxic nice guys never do. They don't have boundaries. They say yes to everything, say yes to everybody because they want everybody to like him and they think in return he's gonna get something. And then secretly deep down, he's miserable and angry because they don't respect him. A true masculine nice guy, he has the ability to say no when he needs to. Setting boundaries also helps protect you from getting taken advantage of, which is something that the toxic nice guy is notorious for. The fourth trait I call masculine charisma. This is all about presentation, how you look, how you smell, how you stand, your body language, your confidence. Nice guys have a difficult time making eye contact. They also notoriously aren't super great when it comes to their looks, their style, or their scent. A woman loves a man who takes pride in ownership in his presentation. Think of it as your personal packaging, your brand. If you dress like shit, if you dress average like everybody else, nobody's gonna respect you, you're not gonna stand out. If you don't smell incredible, guys, this is something else that's going to set you apart from everybody else. Most nice guys are wearing savage. Most nice guys are wearing the cologne they think the women want, as opposed to something that they know smells amazing and coincidentally is super affordable. Like, Giussata titanium. Guys, if you are looking for the sexiest fragrance, literally under 100 bucks, and with that discount code down below, it's even more insane in terms of the price. You have gotta check out Giussata.

Hit the link, do not wait because this deal is not gonna last. Guys, the truth is you have to pay attention to your masculine charisma, all right? The personal packaging, the presentation, it's critical. Even if you are super assertive, even if you do, you know, exemplify some of these other traits, if you don't look good, if you don't take care of your personal packaging and brand, nobody is gonna respect you truthfully. You know, and the great news with it is that it's one of the easiest things that you can do. Sometimes walking into a room and being confident takes a little work, engaging with people. It's hard, saying no to people. I know from experience, this is also difficult, but dressing well, it's easy. Just gotta pay attention, all right? Being well groomed, it's easy. Smelling amazing is easy, right? Having good body language takes a little work, but you can master it. The other beautiful thing of masculine charisma is that it's not just something that's gonna get you more dates, it's something that's gonna make you a more powerful individual. You're gonna have more opportunities, both professionally and personally. You're gonna make more friends. People wanna be around people that they view as attractive. And when you've got that masculine, je ne sais quoi, that's something special that people can't necessarily put their finger on, like, oh, it's because of that, or it's because of that. Total package, right? It's that something special that sets you apart from other people, other guys, other nice guys, nice guys, the toxicine, they don't have it. They don't do it. They're so worried about fitting in and making sure that they wear what they presume to be the appropriate attire or the right fragrance that all the other dudes are wearing, right? A guy that is confident, a guy that is masculine, a guy that is putting forth masculine charisma owns his style, owns his grooming, owns his scent. The next masculine trait that's wildly desirable and women crave is motivation, right? Here's a little secret about nice guys. Typically, when you see a nice guy, you're gonna see somebody that is underperformed in his job and his career and his life. And the reason is pretty simple, because he's so worried about fitting in, he's so worried about not rocking the boat, he does what is expected as opposed to what is in his heart. But a true masculine, nice guy, somebody that doesn't apologize for wanting more, he also doesn't apologize for going after his dreams, but the other reality is this, he's assertive. It is impossible for you to realize your potential or your dreams or get what you want out of life if you are not assertive. If you aren't, if you're gonna let life bend you over and give you the business and I'm not talking about the good, sweet kind, I'm talking about the rough, dirty, nasty kind, if you're gonna allow life to bend you over and not take what you want, you're never gonna achieve anything. Nice guys, the toxic kind, they're the ones that are basically bending over, taking it and wondering why they never get what they want. Because you've been over, you took it, you weren't assertive, you didn't go after your dreams. If you truly wanna achieve greatness, you've gotta be kind. You can't be a dickhead and think that, oh, I'm just gonna be an asshole and I'm just gonna be really tough and then I'm gonna achieve things and then when I do and then everybody's gonna know, here's the deal, I can tell you from experience, you are gonna get further, you are gonna get more out of life, people more out of opportunities. If you are a nice person, if you're kind, if you are, people are gonna wanna do you favors, people are gonna wanna be around you, they're gonna wanna be in your orbit because they believe in you. It's amazingly powerful when you are kind to somebody, when you show them kindness, when you show them gratitude, when you show them respect without an agenda, it's powerful. It also is gonna lead to incredible things for you. Not only are you gonna achieve more in your life, you're gonna find that person of your dreams. Guys, it's possible to be nice as long as you're masculine. You've gotta be kind, you've gotta be respectful, you've gotta help people where you can, but do not get it twisted. There's nothing wrong with being nice, but there is something wrong with being a toxic nice guy or nice guy syndrome. Don't do things because you think you're gonna get something. Do things because it's the right thing to do."

        "transcript": " What's up, gentlemen? Today, a little hairstyle selection tutorial. I'm going to help you pick the best haircut for your face shape. I'm going to show you how to find and identify which face shape you have, but then I'm going to go over some dos and don'ts in terms of face shape selection tips, but I'm also going to show you the five best hairstyles, in my opinion, for each of the various shapes. System number one is identifying which face shape you have, and there are really only four options you need to worry about. There's round, there's square, there's upside down triangle, and there's oval. And to determine which one you have, you could get technical and actually measure the various points on your face, but I think that's actually not needed. What I would recommend is take out your phone, put it in selfie mode, take a picture. Open it up, zoom in a little bit, and then you're going to open up some type of drawing program, alright? And then all you're going to do is trace on top of your face the various shapes. Circle, probably not. Square, probably not. Oval, maybe, but in my opinion, I am more of the upside down triangle. What about you? Alright, so now you have a good idea of what your face shape is. Before we actually get into the various hairstyles, I want to actually go over a few tips in order to always have amazing hair, because it really doesn't matter what hairstyle you select or your face shape, if your hair is f'd up, it's not going to matter. Number one is upgrade the quality of the products you're using. This includes the styling aids, but also your shampoos and conditioners. Bottom line is there is a huge difference in the products that you're going to find in a drugstore that are like $5 and some of the higher end products that are going to be a lot healthier for your hair. Your hair is going to look better, it's going to feel better, and like I said, it's going to be healthier. Number two is condition. You need to condition your hair every single time you use a shampoo. A shampoo is going to strip a lot of the oils and the goodness out of your hair. A conditioner is going to help smooth the hair cuticle, smooth the hair shaft, and make your hair silky, strong, and sexy. Number three is choose the right hair product for the style that you're going for and your hair texture. The reason why they make a bunch of different products like clays, pomades, pates, putties is because they do different things. If you're not sure, go to your barber, go to your stylist, and ask them what product you should actually be using. And the last tip is ditch your crappy hair dryer that you've been using since you've been like 5 years old. The bottom line is the hair dryer you're using is very important in terms of your hair looking good, being healthy, and basically drying quickly. If you guys are looking for the hair dryer that I use, it is this, it is the Lefin Swift. It is the best hair dryer on the market, period. I've been talking about it now for a while because I have always been a fan of high-end hair dryers, because I know the difference. I own a hair salon. And one of the things you're going to notice is that when you start to use a higher quality dryer, your hair is going to be softer, it's going to be healthier. It's also going to dry like super quick. There is a ton of technology built in to the Lefin Swift. About eight years ago, I bought this hair dryer. It was called the Dyson, right? A lot of you guys have heard about it. This was like the first premium hair dryer I ever tried. The problem with this, and the reason why I never really talked about it, is that this hair dryer was literally like $500. And in my opinion, that's just out of reach for a lot of people. But then, I saw my buddy Travis White do a video talking about and featuring the Lefin Swift. Travis did like a head-to-head comparison of the Lefin to the Dyson, and it was like not even close. This is a better hair dryer, and the price is a fraction. And when I mean fraction, I mean crazy fraction of the Dyson. If you want to check out the best hair dryer on the market, I've got a special deal and a link down below. It comes with a few different attachments in terms of nozzles, but the other thing it comes with right now in Wild Supplies Last is a free Lefin Wave. Guys, Lefin is crushing it in terms of technology and these products that they're coming out with. They're offering you superior quality for a fraction of the price. And they're toothbrush guys, the Lefin Wave is the best toothbrush I've ever used. Do my teeth look lighter to you? It's causing this toothbrush, gentlemen. Not only does it vibrate, it oscillates, alright? The wave comes with like an app that you can basically adjust the speed, the vibration, the oscillation. It is next level in terms of technology, not to mention cleanliness. Guys, when you use a high quality toothbrush, your teeth feel like you just literally left the dentist. And right now, this is free for those of you who go through my special link. Guys, this deal won't last, so if you're interested in upgrading the quality of the hair dryer you have, but also your toothbrush game, guys, now is the time. The price is insane. You're not literally going to believe it. These two products are the ones that I use and they are the best. And right now, guys, they're giving you this for free, which is crazy, guys. Hit the link down below. Do not wait because these two products are going to change your life. So first up, we're going to talk about the round face shape. Basically, when it comes to choosing the right hairstyle, it's all about increasing the angularity. One of the downsides of having a round face is you don't have real structure, right? It's a little bit softer and so you need to choose a hairstyle that's basically going to enhance the angularity Choosing a hairstyle that has a little bit more height or volume on top is a great way to elongate the face. Going with shorter tapered sides also is going to help create the visual illusion of more structure to your head. The next thing is angularity. If you have a hairstyle that has some sharp angles or a lot of texture, this also is going to help offset and balance a round face. Contrast. It all boils down to contrast and balance. If you've got a round face, your hairstyle needs more angles, more structure. And so a great option would be the classic pompadour. The pompadour is a great option. Take it a little bit shorter on the sides, adding structure, a little bit higher on top. It's going to visually elongate your face, making it look more narrow and thinner. The classic side part with the tapered side also is another incredible option. And the reason is pretty simple. The offset side part is going to add asymmetry to your face. It's going to draw the eye up and over. Taper the side is going to add balance. And then whether or not you take it up or you do a little bit of fringe down on the side or a little bit of bang action, this is also another great way to help camouflage the roundness of your face. The textured crop with the high fade also, perfect for somebody that has a round face. Because once again, tapered sides, faded, nice and high, with the texture up top. The texture is going to add interest. It's going to add balance. And it's also going to help elongate visually that face. Now, something else that you can add is a little bit of facial hair. But the secret to this is making sure that it's tapered. All right, if you've got facial hair and you've got a round face and it's just big and bushy, it's going to accentuate the roundness of your face. Instead, take it short, nice and tight. What I'd recommend is blend it to your side so you don't have like a hard line. And then gradually taper it or fade it down to the chin. The hair on your chin should be slightly longer than the hair on your cheek. Next up, let's talk about the square face. You have crazy angles, right? Very strong, very structured. What you need in order to offset this is a little bit of softness for your hair. And so some of the longer styles are going to be better. Something a little bit more flowy is going to help elongate your face and soften some of the hard angles. Instead of looking for something that's super rigid or structured or tall, like somebody with a round face, you need something that's a little bit softer, like we've mentioned. And so texture, layers, letting your hair grow a little bit longer. This is going to accentuate everything and make you look a lot more attractive because of the contrast and balance to your face shape. Now, in terms of styles, the old money side part is going to be epic on you, all right? It's going to be a little bit longer, not so tight or faded on the sides. It's going to have a little bit more flow. It's going to be a little bit longer. You're still going to have that nice side part that you can push back if you want to be a bit more professional or you can pull that fringe and those bangs forward a little bit to add more softness. Something else is the bro flow, right? The bro flow is amazing for somebody that has a very structured face, all right? You're going to have more waves. You're going to have more natural volume and texture. It's going to be a little bit softer of a hairstyle. This softness is going to complement and contrast the structure and squareness of your face. Center part curtains also another great option for you. Once again, the old money aesthetic hairstyles are going to look incredible on you because of the structure and the squareness and the softness of those styles. But the center part curtain also another great option. Those curtains are going to help soften everything up, but I got to warn you, it shouldn't be too pencil straight. You need more separation. You need more definition, which means you need more layers and also possibly some razoring. Now, if you want to go with something a bit shorter, the French crop is also going to work as long as there's a lot of texture up top and you've got some bangs pulled down onto your forehead. This is going to help soften everything up as long as you don't go super tight or super high with that fade. I would recommend leaving the hair a little bit longer on your sides just to make it a bit rounder and soft. In terms of shaving your head, this doesn't necessarily look great because it's going to accentuate the structure and the squareness of your face. But if you want to go with a crew cut, leave in a little hair up top, tapering the sides. This is going to help round everything out visually and then if you add facial hair, even better. The facial hair is going to help balance the face. It's going to draw the eye down and it's going to help add some softness and structure to your jaw. If you grow your chin hair a little bit longer than the cheeks, this also is going to draw the eye down and eliminate the illusion of the square face. Next up, let's talk about the upside down triangle. You're going to be wider up here, dropping it down to a pointy chin. For you, it's all about softness. Curtains also will make your forehead be a little bit less noticeable and will help balance everything out. The brow flow, also another great option. The classic side part, incredible. I would add a little bit of fringe to help camouflage the size of your forehead or I should say the width, but this is going to help balance everything out. Doing some type of textured fringe, also another amazing option. In terms of the sides, whether or not you want to go super tight or a high fade, it's really personal preference. Messy fringe on you if you have an upside down triangle is going to look incredible. You're going to help camouflage the forehead a little bit and you're going to add a lot of texture and softness up towards the top of your head. Now if you want to look even better, add a little bit of facial hair, but as opposed to the other two facial hair styles we talked about in terms of a beard trimming it down and tapering it, what I'd recommend for you is allow it to be kind of like one length or a little bit puffier in the cheeks and the sides. The reason is because it's going to help round out your jaw a little bit more as opposed to making it even more defined and even longer. Because if you have a pointy chin and you grow a beard that is very tapered or pointy, it's going to actually accentuate the shape of your face. Instead, take it a little bit more natural, a little bit rounder. The last face shape is actually the luckiest and that is the oval face shape. The reason why it's lucky is you can rock like any style and it looks amazing as long as your hair texture and the style that you're going for works. The reason is because you've got amazing symmetry built into the structure of your face. If you want to do a hairstyle that has more angles, looks great. If you want to do something with a little more softness, it looks great. Literally like any hairstyle looks good with your face shape because of the symmetry that your face already has. The last tip I'd like to give you is use AI to try different hairstyles on you. This is something that you can do. There are a lot of different programs and platforms out there. If you do a little Google search for AI, hairstyle, selection tips or whatever, you're going to find different tools that you can upload a picture of yourself and then try a lot of different hairstyles. Then once you find a style that you want to rock, take that picture to your barber or stylist and be like, yo, I'm going to rock this. Can you help me? They're going to be like, yeah, let's do it or no, you're probably shouldn't and this is why. Let them help you have amazing hair."

        "transcript": " So if you're a six foot white dude, chances are you're gonna make more money than like everybody else, because that's what the data shows. If you're six feet and white, you're gonna make more money. If you're attractive, you're gonna make more money than somebody who is unattractive. But, good news gentlemen, there are things that you can wear that are going to have a dramatic impact on your earning potential backed by science. Today guys, I'm gonna go over my list of items that will boost your earning potential, starting with number one, which is a beard. Now you're like, whoa, alpha, come on. Yeah, beard's gonna make me attractive. Yeah, beard's gonna make me sexy. Yeah, beard's gonna make me feel more confident. But, the data shows trust. When it comes to making money, getting a sale, making friends, getting a promotion, it comes down to do people trust you. And what the data actually is showing is that men that have beards are viewed as more trustworthy. Now, there's a caveat to this, because if it's too long, if it's too big, if it's too bushy, if it's unkempt, it actually does the opposite. It makes people trust you less. A short to medium length beard that is well groomed, edged up, nice and tight, is going to elicit the feeling of trust and make you more money. Number two is a Rolex watch. All right, now you're like, wait a second, seriously? Yes, seriously. So, here's the deal, something that I noticed when I bought my first luxury watch. And not just any luxury watch, I'm talking specifically about a Rolex, because it's about what other people recognize. And what I came to realize is that when I put a Rolex on my wrist, I could walk into literally like any room and I automatically had the respect of other people around me, even if they had higher status than me. But the other thing that was amazing about wearing a luxury timepiece is that it also boosted my self-esteem. I felt more confident. And when it comes to making money, when it comes to sales or getting a promotion, there's something that you can wear or put on that automatically boosts your self-esteem or your feelings about yourself, it's gonna translate into your confidence. And when you walk into a room and you feel confident about yourself, this is automatically going to make you look people in the eye, your body language is gonna improve, and you're gonna have more opportunities and make more money. Number three is the navy suit. That has been tailored to perfection. All right, not a pinstripe suit, not a pattern suit, navy suit, solid navy suit. Peak lapel? No, not lapel. A standard basic navy suit is the suit that you're gonna rock that's gonna help you ascend that corporate ladder and make more denaro. Why? Well, a few reasons. Navy is the best color when it comes to suits for being trusted. You think it's a coincidence that all these politicians are rocking navy suits? No, of course, even though they're huge scumbags, they're like, yo, if I wear navy, this is subconsciously and psychologically gonna make other people trust me more, which it does. Now, this brings me to something else I just wanna talk about, and that is being too fashionable. Now, I am a fan of taking fashion risks and being a little bit more outside of the box, but when it comes to you earning the most amount of money that you possibly can, you gotta tone it down, you gotta push it down. Cause once again, it's about conforming to the norm, but taking it to that next level. If you are somebody that's super fashion forward, people are gonna get a little bit weird about that because it's a little bit different, right? People don't know how to necessarily interpret it. And so what I can tell you is this, if you are looking to maximize your potential in terms of career movement or sales or opportunities, you've gotta tone it down, be stylish without going too far. Brings me to number four, and that is high quality leather shoes. All right, now here's the deal, people notice shoes. Even if you don't think that they do, they do. And when somebody walks into a room and they've got good shoes on, it automatically sends a subliminal message that they respect themselves, and they're somebody that somebody can trust and is going to get the job done and is worthy of giving them their business or helping them in terms of career movement. Shoes are one of those things that can instantly like ruin your chances of making a sale, getting a date or getting a promotion because people notice shoes even if you don't. They need to be stylish, they need to be clean, they need to be presentable. And then the other thing is your belt, all right? We're gonna talk a little bit more about accessories in a second, but a belt is one of those things that honestly is killing a lot of guys. And the reason is because a belt says a lot about you and your ability to stick to a diet because if you've got a bunch of holes on that belt and it's on like the last pole, everybody knows, oh, that belt used to fit him, it's gotten too small. Or if the belt is all beat up, it means that you're lazy. All right, it means that you're like unkempt. It means that you are not going to be responsible. All right, one of the things I can tell you is that belts matter. If it doesn't match your shoes, another sign to somebody else, that you're out of touch. Your belt needs to coordinate with your outfit. It needs to be polished, it needs to be clean. It needs to be sexy. This, in my opinion, is the sexiest belt out there on the market. It is an Anson belt. So I've talked about Anson belts like thousands of times. These belts are the best on the market. And the beautiful thing is that they're super affordable. And right now, guys, they've got a special link down below that's gonna help you build a box set for under $100, which means you get to pick two buckles and three straps. You can mix and match. And that's the thing about Anson that's so amazing. They're all interchangeable. All right, so check this out. As you can see, there are no holes. No holes to show other people that you're lazy. No holes to show that it's the wrong size. All right, the way that it does it is right here. See that? It's the track system. That is the magic and the voodoo behind these belts being perfect. And then check it out, right? Right there. All the buckles, all the straps are interchangeable. And so if you're like, yo, I wanna match my watch, I'm feeling like silver boom right there, right? And then all you do is slide it in right there, lock it into place, and you are good to go. Check it out. So clean, so perfect, so amazing. Another one of my favorite buckles is actually this. It's black, all right? I love this combination. I'm about to show you so much, all right? Check it out. The murdered out Anson, are you kidding me?

If you have a pair of shoes, you can find a leather belt that's gonna match it. And that's one of the things that's kind of difficult, right? You'll have, you know, a pair of shoes. You're like, yo, I got some like funky, like blue pair of shoes. And I can't find a belt. Well, with Anson, you can. You ready? You ready? Ready? Check it out. Look at that.

You can mix and match. It's a total of six belt combinations for under $100. It is a huge belt, no-brainer. You're also, in turn, gonna A, win the holidays because everybody's gonna love them, and B, make more money because you're gonna look better. Some other things that have an incredible potential ROI is a sport coat. All right, a nice tailored sport coat, whether or not it's Navy or something a little bit more daring, like a houndstooth, is also another incredible thing to invest in because if you walk into a room, even if you're wearing like khakis or jeans, a button-up shirt or even a polo, if you throw on a jacket over top of it, it automatically elevates your aesthetic but also your perception in terms of class and money. Leather bags and briefcases. When you carry your crap in a duffel bag or some like cheap backpack, people automatically lose respect for you and you don't have the same street credor credibility as somebody that's carrying something that's higher quality, like a leather bag or a leather briefcase. If you're carrying a high-quality leather bag or briefcase into the office or into a meeting, it sends the message that you are professional and it also sends the message that you appreciate finer things. And once again, it's about trust. If the same person walks in with a duffel bag or a backpack over his shoulder that he got for $35, it doesn't send the same message and in turn is gonna make you less money. The classic white tailored dress shirt. Now, some of you are like, but I look better in blue. What about some funky pattern? No, white dress shirts are the thing that are gonna make you more money. It's gotta be clean, it's gotta be crisp, it's gotta be tailored to your body. Once again, I need to pull back and bring you back to the fact that how your clothing fits you is more important than what you're actually wearing. Anybody can wear an expensive suit, but if it's not tailored, it doesn't matter. If you are wearing a shirt and it's big, it's baggy, you've got a big muffin' top, it doesn't matter that it's white, it doesn't matter, like if it had dollar bills stapled to it, you are not sending the right message. You've gotta wear clothing that fits, invest the money in tailoring. But white sends the message of trustworthiness, cleanliness, professionalism, not to mention just sexiness. Speaking of sexy, next up is stylish eyewear. These aren't exactly what I'm talking about, but the deal is if you need glasses, one of the things that you can invest in to basically make a statement, but also be viewed as more intelligent, not to mention just more in style and on trend, is get a cool pair of rings, all right? Something that has structure to it is gonna make you look more interesting. It also is an accessory that you get to rock on your face. Speaking of accessories, in terms of rings, I would avoid these in a professional environment, other than like a wedding band, all right? If you're somebody that's rocking like a bunch of rings, it looks a little bit low class. Also bracelets, I would avoid. Earrings, definitely out. In terms of chains, you shouldn't be able to see them. In terms of cufflinks and tie bars, these are something I would possibly invest in. Cufflinks are a great addition to any guy's wardrobe. They also send the message that you are more polished, you're more put together, and more professional. A tie bar also just lets people know that you are attention to detail oriented, which is in turn gonna make people trust you and hire you more. The next thing we gotta talk about is your hairstyle, all right? Hairstyles matters when it comes to people trusting you or hiring you. If you are rocking something that is outdated, like a mullet or a flat top or something that has a lot of hair product in it, or your hair looks crispy, oily, or greasy, once again, people are not gonna trust you because it's gonna be viewed as outdated or a little bit gross, or you're not gonna be viewed as hygienic. And so, look for a style that's a little bit more on the conservative side. Even the old money hairstyle is a great option. The next thing we gotta talk about is the way that you smell. In the workplace, fragrance is one of those things that you gotta be careful about, right? Because you're around a lot of people and you never know when somebody's gonna be very sensitive to the way that you smell. And so, if you're using a lot of fragrance, this is definitely going to impact you in a negative way. If you are gonna be wearing a fragrance, I would recommend one or two squirts. That's it. Not three or four, one or two. You wanna make sure that it's more subtle, more subdued, as opposed to pungent in your face. Fact, if you're six foot two, white dude, good body, congratulations. You suck and everybody hates you, but you are gonna make more money. If you're attractive, you are gonna make more money than somebody who's not attractive. But the good news is that even if you're not tall or good looking, you can wear the items that we talked about in today's video and you will make more money."

        "transcript": " I love your cross body bag. It's so manly and rugged said no spicy senorita ever Like as in like ever gentlemen today. We're gonna talk about not only the cross body bag. We're talking about bags We're talking about backpack. We're even talking about wallets So one of the things that separates boys from men is how you carry your crap. We talk a lot about style We talk a lot about personal presentation But one of the factors that oftentimes gets overlooked is the items that we use in order to carry the stuff that we take with us On a daily basis and so today I want to go over my list of items that you should basically pay attention to What you should invest in and what you basically should throw out right number one is your wallet All right, if you are rocking a big fat wallet, it's out of style. It looks ridiculous It also jacks up your clean sexy lines of your clothing All right, if your wallet looks like you're a little boy You got Belcro and maybe like a Superman sign also in mature instead What you should be looking for is something like this. All right the simple clean minimal Leather wallet alright these two came from Thursday boots I'll link to these down below if you guys want to check them out But the deal is this all right what you're looking for something slim and minimal and the reason why this is so perfect is that it's Gonna fit nicely in the front pocket of your pants It's a front pocket wallet all right as opposed to sitting on some big thing that's gonna jack up your posture All right, the other thing that's perfect with this is the amount that it actually carries You've got two slots on either side for cards and then in the center a little slot for cash or any type of paper Here's another one that I recently ordered from Thursday's. It's that brown kind of distressed antique leather Once again that slot in the center simply perfect number two is Your suitcase all right one of the things that matters in my opinion all right nice luggage is a game changer All right, I would expect that you're gonna want to travel right you're gonna want to go places Whether or not it's on a plane or just a weekend getaway and how you pack your crap when you're going in my opinion It says a lot about you investing in a luggage set meaning a roller carry on and a suitcase that you can actually check in My opinion is a must for every adult dude something else though is your top kit Investing in a high quality top kit guys is in my opinion worth the money You're gonna spend you're also gonna have it for years literally you buy this like once all right this one is from Thursday boots I'm gonna link to it down below. They've got other colors right. I absolutely love it. It's got everything you need right It's got a big huge center pocket that's perfect for all your grooming goodness You've got a zipper pocket inside and then on the outside you have two additional pockets one with the zipper And then you've also got the strap guys I'm telling you if you don't have a top kit you need one next up We're gonna talk about those big sexy oversized leather duffels alright, so I'm gonna be 100% honest with you I fell for these meaning like I saw them and I'm like yo, they're so cool if I'm going on like a quick weekend getaway I can toss it in my car. I can pack it It looks awesome and rugged and all that good stuff and it does but I never ever ever ever Use them and the reason is pretty simple once you pack these two things or something like this with clothing and your top Kid and shoes and everything they're heavy as hell and the other thing is it doesn't have wheels And so there you are lugging this big-ass thing like through the hotel or wherever It's super impractical and even though you think in your head you're like yo that Louis Vuitton bag It's so sick and I'm gonna look awesome rocking it You're gonna look awesome, but you're never gonna rock it in my opinion This should be like a yo I got tons of extra money and I just want to waste some because literally I would invest the money in higher quality Luggage because you're gonna use it. I would not invest in a big huge bag Now this doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a duffel bag for the gym though, right? Which brings me to the next thing I kind of want to talk about and that is gym bags This little string bag that used to be so popular They suck and if you're an adult dude and you're rocking this you don't look like an adult dude All right, gym bags shouldn't be gigantic You shouldn't be toting all your protein your pre-workout 27 bottles of supplements your wraps your belt six changes of clothes Different shoot like seriously seriously seriously do you need it? The answer is probably not and so what I'd recommend is something that's a little bit smaller more manageable I would definitely go with a darker color because that thing is gonna be like on the ground You also in my opinion shouldn't spend a lot of money on a gym bag or a gym duffel bag because it's gonna get beat up It's gonna get nasty and it's gonna smell like your ass Backpack time. All right, so as you guys know I have a love-hate relationship with backpacks All right, if you're wearing a backpack and it looks like this or it looks like this, right? It is not stylish. It is not sexy at all But it is functional if you're going on like a hike somewhere and you want to pack that bitch full like of apples and water and Bikes to have like a picnic with your spicy senderita then absolutely you got to wear it, right? But if you are just a younger dude or a professional man that wants to carry his stuff not in like a messenger bag You do have better options like this. All right, this is an example of a mature sexy Rugged backpack it is leather it is matte black it is from Thursday boots Which I will link to down below along with the other stuff I showed and it is absolutely perfect in terms of a Grown-up backpack right now this one's got all the bells and whistles It even has a little flap back there for like putting on your suitcase or your handle your suitcase when you're traveling The straps have a little bit of cushion. You've got different pockets You've got different pouches But the thing that I love so much about it is the fact that it's a backpack But it still has a very rugged masculine aesthetic so check it out, right? How much better and sexier? Does this look right exactly and it just so happens it matches my boots guys if you have not checked out Thursday boots in a while they have more than just amazing badass boots They also have a lot of incredible essential leather goods that you as a modern stylish rugged man are gonna absolutely love like the wallets like the Doppkits and like the bags all right this backpack is Incredible guys if you are somebody who wants to upgrade your style You can do it very simply and easily with a bag like this and the price the price is Insane a link down below go check out what Thursday has and if you haven't bought boots yet for the season now would be the time The next thing we got to talk about is the computer bag All right, because this is another thing that a lot of guys carry but a lot of guys carry the wrong one All right, so this is the right one once again. It's leather. This is also from Thursday boots Of course look how rugged look how stylish right as opposed to what I used to carry Which was this right? It's kind of that Swiss army like nylon Beat up this looks pedestrian honestly It looks like every other boring dude, but this looks stylish It looks rugged and so when you enter a coffee shop or a business meeting and you're carrying something like this It automatically sends the message that you are reliable You're responsible and you also appreciate quality because that's the thing that wearing and carrying Nice clothing and bags actually says to the outside world It says I respect myself and in turn you're gonna get more opportunities You're gonna get more jobs people are gonna want to be friends with you people are gonna want to date you because people Notice how you carry your shit manbags a.k.a. The Merc is what we're talking about next. So here's the deal What do you do? You got a few things that you want to carry around right? You're gonna be out for the afternoon Maybe going and grabbing a burrito with a spicy sitting reader or whoever right you got a few things You got a bottle of water you got your phone or maybe you're going to a nice outing or a festival right and you're like You know, I don't want to carry all my stuff in my pockets my wallet my phone my keys bottle of water Maybe some cologne to smell good later. I don't know. I'm not I'm not judging. I'm just saying what do you do? You carry a big backpack. No, that's overkill manbag. Of course. That's what you're looking for What is a man bag? Basically it is a small bag that basically you can fit some crap It not a lot but just a little now what you should look for something minimal something sexy a lot of great brands out There one of my favorite is to me to me unfortunately is very expensive this one is nutsack Unfortunately, it's a little bit more rugged and so if you're wearing something a little bit nicer probably not gonna work This bag right here is from the brand diesel I got this at like a discount store like a Nordstrom rack or something years and years ago, but it was kind of like the perfect Size right it's perfect I can throw like a camera a little tripod in there, but it's a great little bag to basically have to carry around now The last thing we got to talk about is the cross-body bag Aka the fanny pack that people are now wearing across their body as opposed to where they're supposed to be worn Which is on your butt so fanny packs honestly like on a dude nowadays Doesn't look all that great unless you're like Joe Rogan, but he gets it he rocks it and he owns it He's not stylish, but he looks great most guys that I see today wearing a cross-body bag Not like on their butt but like on their body are typically gonna be a little bit younger if you are a more mature man This is probably not the look or the style I would go for I do think it does lean a little bit young and youthful But you know it is a style I personally would opt for something else like a man purse something with a longer strap That's more bag inspired even if the bag is a little bit smaller There are a lot of brands out there that are making Smaller bags that a guy can carry that look incredibly cool that are also super rugged guys bottom line is this how you carry your shit It matters it matters greatly because people notice one of the quickest things you can do to elevate your aesthetic is Elevate the way you carry your crap"

        "transcript": " I was hooked. Like I was obsessed. Were you obsessed with me? Yeah. No you weren't. Ha ha ha. Were you obsessed? I was obsessed. Our role has changed. You're blessed. I'm blessed. You're in pain. You're fortunate. I hate that word. You're fortunate. Whatever we are super fortunate. Whatever we are blessed, fortunate, whatever. Yes. I feel like it may be old fashioned. Now that being said, something else that you need to do as a man, even if you are working, even if you are having a busy day is, that's all right, looking better with age. You're like a fine wine, my mama. You're still my spicy senorita. Hey honey. Hi honey. I need you to act like you like me today. Yeah, exactly. I need you. I need an interview. Let's find a place to sit. What's up everybody? Today I wanted to do kind of a special video. I wanted to invite my wife on and talk a little bit about kind of relationships because we've been together now for 21 years. 21 long years. Long. Bliss. Obelisk. It hasn't been obelisk, but we're gonna get into it today. I wanna talk a little bit about kind of our relationship and some of the things that I feel have allowed us to basically stay together in a world of everybody kind of like calling it quits, like super quick. And I look around at a lot of my friends, a lot of people that I know and, you know, staying together for a long time doesn't seem as, it doesn't seem as prevalent as it used to be. Would you agree? Yeah, I would agree. How come? Any idea? It's hard. Marriage is hard. And, you know, life happens and things happen. And, you know. I think social media also makes it harder. Yes, yeah, I would agree. And I think it's so, you know, sometimes people just are like, you know what, I can't do this anymore. It's hard, you know, or I think I'd be better on my own or I think I'd be better with someone else. It's easy to bail. It takes work. It takes hard work and it takes you both being committed to the process and the relationship. But if you're delusional and think, oh, it's just gonna be roses, sunshine, and BJs all the time, it's not. You're gonna have challenges. You're gonna have issues that are gonna come up. But let's basically back it up from the beginning. All right, how did we meet? Well, first spoke, we were in a Mexican restaurant. That's right. It was a Saturday night karaoke. Yeah, baby. I was singing and I shouldn't be singing, but I had a few cocktails. And I saw you from the gym and I noticed you and I recognized you. I came up to you and basically that was the beginning. I was hooked. Like I was obsessed. Were you obsessed with me? Yeah. No, you weren't. What are you obsessed? I was obsessed. I liked you. No, it was, I did know. You were, it was easy. Yeah. Like everything with you, it was easy. We were friends, like all of the boxes were kind of checked when I met you. Was it a problem that I wasn't super tall? No, no. You didn't care. I never, ever, ever, ever crossed my mind. Oh well, God, I wish he was tall. Never. Yeah. Well, I'm only five one. Yeah. So granted you're only five six, but I'm, don't cheat me. I'm sorry, five six and a half. But like I'm five one. Yeah. So you're still inches taller than me. It's not like I'm five eight and you're five six and a half. Yeah. You know, but no, like, mm-mm. So we met, we started dating and almost like immediately we kind of like were inseparable. I moved into her house. She had a house, I had a house. And that was one of the things that I think really kind of just struck me about you right from the beginning was how independent you were and how successful you were. Because at the time I was a struggling fitness owner and you were in a career and making like six figures and doing really, really well. You also were a 27 year old woman living by yourself, had your own home, drive in Alexis. Like it was super impressive to see how well you'd done on your own. Our path was a little different. I did not spend four years in college like you did. So that just allowed me, I lucked out with a career that didn't necessarily require a pedigree. I worked my butt off. So I feel like the only reason why I was a little more successful than you was because I had four years of career. And I was trying to start a business and that usually doesn't work. So that's the other thing. We dated for four years, I proposed, I didn't have JamesAllen.com and so I had to go to a jewelry store and it was a horrible process. But the end result was she said yes. Now for you guys that are thinking about buying an engagement ring or popping the question, I do want to real quick mention today's video sponsor JamesAllen.

Guys, JamesAllen.com, I got that special link down below. Go through my link because right now they've got an incredible deal that you do not wanna miss. So we tied the knot and we have had some ups and downs since then. It hasn't been all great. We've had some challenges. Like every relationship is gonna have challenges but you get through them, you work through them because you decide and you commit to being with the person. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So a few other things I just wanted to write down. What is a reason that you think that we've been able to stay together over the course of 21 years? We've definitely had our ups and downs like you said but neither of us have kind of done the unforgivables. Like we make mistakes all the time but you don't do the unforgivables, right? Yeah. Whatever that's defined in your relationship. So the other thing with us is we don't have children, right? And so I think that that's probably, I think that could go either way in terms of stay together or break up because of how stressful we hear kids are. Yeah, parenting differences, financial struggles that may come with raising kids. Raising kids is very expensive. But. And I think, I see it go both ways. I see people who are like, oh my God, our children really complete us and complete our marriage. Or I've seen it where it's like, well, I'm stuck here because I have kids. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing you mentioned was finances. Yeah. And so something that Tracy and I have always done, I don't know that it's good or bad but we have separate finances. Like my bank account is my bank account, her bank account is her bank account. It's not that we don't like. Our money is ours. Our money is our money, but we have always from day one had separate accounts, which I think has actually been beneficial. Now, in the early days, it was me being embarrassed because I didn't make much money and I didn't wanna basically put that, or impose that on you for having more. But to this day, and it's honestly, it's one of those things where I don't worry about what she's spending. She doesn't worry what I'm spending, but that brings me to another point. We are aligned financially and fiscally. Yeah, we are like-minded financially. Neither of us, we are big spenders. Neither of us wanna live beyond our means. We're both very, we're financially like-minded. Which is important. If you are not financially on the same page with somebody, it's- A struggle. It is a struggle because you're always gonna be butting heads and money and children. Those are the two things that most couples argue with the most. And so for us, not having kids, not having that issue, we've got cats, but they are pretty easy to manage. Except when they're bad, and then I am a little bit more lenient than my wife, yeah? You're the disciplinarian. This is true. But finances also, making sure that you're on the same page. You also need to make sure that you're on the same page philosophically as well. Like if you are Jewish and somebody else is agnostic, but you have super strong faith or beliefs, the other person doesn't and you think, oh, someday I'm gonna change them. This is also something that can be really hard to overcome. There's no changing anybody. Yeah. No. Which brings me to another thing. And that is, you're not gonna change somebody, but you can change yourself when you need to. And what I mean by that is, I am a different person today than I was when we got married and vice versa. Would you agree? No, absolutely. Like both of us. The evolution as we grow and mature and that being aligned with the marriage evolution. Yeah. Like everybody grows, everybody changes in so many ways. Sometimes people grow in directions that your partner may not be aligned with and it can be a deal breaker. Yeah, absolutely. Like you see it happen. Or you grow and it's like, okay, well, I'm okay with you wanting to be X, Y, Z now versus PDQ before. You align and you evolve essentially with them. Yep. Are your, I guess, the acceptance of the evolution? Yeah. The other thing is, sometimes as you grow and the longer you're with somebody, some of the things that were a bigger deal or an issue before become less of a deal or less of an issue. You get more used to things, but you also come to accept certain personality quirks or issues that a person may have that might have driven you crazy or they drive you crazy even more because you've been with somebody like super long. You change. You change. You change. And what's the thing about me that drives you the craziest? Your intent has helped. Yeah. And like you're a lot. I'm a lot. Oh my God. I'm a lot. I'm a lot. And you're a lot about a lot of things. I'm a lot about a lot of things. I'm in it. I'm in a lot about pretty much everything. I'm an entrepreneur and I'm also an only child. And I get super into things and I have, sometimes I micromanage a little bit, but I'm, what, you're saying I don't? Guys, listen to me for a second. Pay attention. If you never listen to anything else I ever say, don't ever leave a trail of sticky notes for your wife through the house giving her instructions. Okay, here we are. All right, so that might have happened once or twice, but whatever. So what I'm trying to say is, okay, so I am an entrepreneur, I am intense. It comes with its positives because you've dated lazy people that have sucked, but then there's the polar opposite of the highly motivated person that wants to basically keep achieving and doing and never like chilling out. And that's me, but I'm trying to get better. I feel like the overachieving in the drive is a total different characteristic than the quote a lot. Yeah. Because your drive is amazing. Yeah. And you're- It's the micromanaging and the, yeah. Yeah, it's hard to really describe it. It's hard to, you'd have to hang it. I'll be sure to video that. No, no, no, no. No, there are no more sticky notes ever since we've moved. But it's one of those things where it's just, it's a process. I am constantly trying to be better though. And it's be better for you. Even though I know that we've been married for 21 years, you can't just phone it in and be like, oh, fuck it, everything's cool. And you just, it will wither and die. You've got to keep putting in the effort every single day. Like I feel like I am, you know, A, I'm more and more proud and in love with you every day. Just so you know, if I haven't told you that in a while. And the other thing is I'm trying to be better for you so that we are a better couple every single day. Yeah, you have to communicate. And there have been many times during our relationship, challenging times where we've had to kind of get, okay, okay, okay, stop, stop. Both of us just stop. What is most important to you right now? Like give me your top three things that you need me to work on. And what are your top three things in reverse? And then you have to listen. And you have to like, okay, you need me to do this, this and that, got it. I'm really gonna work on that. You're gonna work on my three things. And it sounds very trivial and easy, but sometimes it's really hard in the heat of, frustration and resentment and arguing to get to that point. And that's like communicating and listening. One of the hardest things that I've had to learn is just to kind of walk away. People communicate differently. People argue differently. People need different things. I am an over communicator. And when there's a problem, like I wanna just keep like, I wanna hammer it, hammer it, hammer it, hammer it. Let's talk about it, talk about it, talk about it. And a lot of people are not like that. You are not like that. You need me to basically just like walk away and she'll say, stop talking. I need to calm down. I need a minute. And it's hard. It's something that I've had to work really hard. I'm not a hundred percent perfect at it, but I understand better now that it's better for us to be able to talk a little bit later and just to leave, go do something and let the situation kind of simmer down and settle down. And I think that comes too from understanding each other. Like why are you that way? Yeah. And then why am I the one that needs a minute? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like there's that too. It's like, okay, I know this person. We've been in this exact, I know why, I know what he needs and I know why and I'm gonna give him what he needs. But I know where it's coming from, if that makes sense. Yep. I'm just looking at my notes real quick. Good to know, it's better. You're motivated and that's something that I respect and admire and you're not lazy. No, I'm not lazy. She keeps the house like super tight. She cooks dinner. It sounds old fashioned. It sounds old fashioned. But it's, in my opinion, it's kind of not. It works. Like at this point, there have been points in our marriage where we were both working like long hours and I feel like when we were both working long hours, we chipped in equally on the house, right? Because we were both working. Well, no, I'm not working. I'm blessed enough that I've been able to quit work. So my role has changed. You're blessed. I'm blessed. You're fortunate. I hate that word. You're fortunate. Whatever we are super fortunate, whatever we are less fortunate, whatever. Yes. I feel like it may be old fashioned, but now that I'm not working, I try to handle 100% at the house stuff because you are working. Yeah, they're roles. And that's the thing. Now, that being said, something else that you need to do as a man, even if you are working, even if you are having a busy day, is help around the house where you can. Don't be a filthy animal in a slob. Put your dishes away. It's a little thing, but it just shows, when you don't do that, it shows a lack of respect for the person that you're with. And so I guess that's kind of the place I'd like to wrap things up, is respect. And the other thing is respect is more than just, hey, I respect you. It's not going out with your buddies, doing stupid shit, going out drinking, doing things that a lot of guys do that end up basically causing a lot of issues or problems in a relationship. I also am not worried about me having some midlife crisis because I get to live my dream. And you have allowed me to do that. And I couldn't have done any of this without you because you were my support system. And I've also been said, there's no way I would have been successful if I wasn't married. And the reason is because when you're worried about dating or chasing or going after spicy ass all the time, it takes a big part of your focus and your brain power. But because that was all taken away, I had my wife and my girl situated at home. Everything was cool. I could go and pursue what I need to pursue and not worry about this other thing that a lot of guys really worry about. And so even though you weren't there doing the videos or you weren't there helping me with certain things, it was still just the fact that you were my rock and that I could know that you were taking care of things that has allowed me. And I brought success to the table as well. And I think another good thing was my earlier success than yours, Drunk gave you more drive. Yeah. Yeah, you were like, okay, I gotta catch up. Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

        "transcript": " Beards! Beards! What about? Beards! Beards what? Beards! Beards what? Beards are hot. Beards make you look sexy gentlemen, we talked about it before, but they also make you look older in a recent study, done. They showed a bunch of spices in your Rita. A bunch of pictures of dudes from clean shaven to fully bearded. And what they concluded is that a big, bold beard actually makes you look 8 to 10 years older. Okay, it's all about beards, bitches. I'm talking about a few mistakes that you may be making that are actually making you look older than you should, even though beards in and of themselves do make you look older. One of those things that we're going to talk about is actually a gray beard. Does a gray beard make you look older? Yes. Does dying it make you look younger? Possibly. And today I'm actually going to show you how to properly dye your beard to look like natural as opposed to like super black and obvious. Which is actually one of the other mistakes that we're going to talk about in today's video. And that is dyeing your beard in unnatural shade of like jet blackness, alright? But the deal is today I want to actually help you look as young as you possibly can rock in a beard, because a beard in and of itself does make a man look older. There was a study that we've talked about before that showed women different stages of hair growth on dudes, right? A bunch of pictures of a bunch of dudes from clean shaven to 10 days double to full big beard and everything in between. And as you know, the research shows that 10 days double is the length facial hair that women find the most attractive on men. But they also concluded that guys that had like big beards actually looked 8 to 10 years older than they actually are. Which is a problem in my opinion. Number one is not edging it up, right? Now, why is this so important? Alright, old dudes basically are notorious for just letting their facial hair like rock. In terms of like just grow any way it wants to grow, which typically means it's going to grow high on the cheeks and it's going to grow down low on the beard. Gentlemen, the first thing you need to do in order to not look like an old man with a beard is edge it up, right? On the cheeks, you got to make sure it's not climbing up your face. In terms of the neck, this one we talk about often because this is one of the big mistakes that guys make. They let the beard grow down their neck or they carve it too high. Head straight, take your finger, boom. Shave below, leave above. That's it. Only option, don't ask again. Whether you edge and trim your beard, it's critical for you looking your best and not like an old geezer. Alright, if your face is just like wild with hair, it makes it look like you don't care. When you're trimmed up, when you're edged up, it makes you look like you're respectable, you're responsible, and you're young, cool, and relevant. The second big mistake that's making you look older with a beard is a huge beard, a big beard, a wide beard, a wild beard. Research has shown that the bigger the beard, the older you look. What I'd recommend is keep it trimmed, keep it edged, keep it maintained. I've talked about this a bunch in terms of the most attractive facial hairstyle, which is basically like 10-day stubble. In terms of the length, what is 10-day stubble? It's basically 5mm. The way that you're going to do that if you want 10-day stubble is get your brio beard scape, which I'll link to down below because this tool is the best. You're going to pop on your 3mm attachment and then you're going to drop the micro adjustments all the way down. When you drop it all the way down, that basically is 4.9 in terms of the length. What that looks like is this. I'm just going to do it here. Guys, if you don't have a brio beard scape, you are totally missing out. Once you upgrade the quality of the tool that you're using, you're going to have a better-looking beard. With the brio beard scape, it is the best tool on the market. I've got that link down below. It comes with a bunch of different attachments. It's got a cool charging port. It also has a titanium rake and a ceramic blade. It also comes with micro adjustments, which means you've got the ultimate in control and making sure that your beard always looks amazing. Guys, I'm going to link down below to the brio beard scape 2.0. Like I said, right now, they've got an incredible deal for you.

Then what I'm going to do is actually come in and edge up my face. The thing about the zero blade, it takes it literally skin bald. Look at that. It literally takes it skin bald. So if you're somebody that suffers from like ingrown hairs, razor burning bumps, the zero blade, you pop that on. It looks like it's down to the skin, but it's not going to take it below the skin, which is going to prevent the irritation, the bumps and the ingrown hairs from actually happening. It's also the perfect body grooming tool. I use this on every part of my body. My brio beard scape knows my body better than my wife because literally it's been in every nook and cranny and it never disappoints. Guys, if you want the best grooming experience that you've ever had, you got to hit that link down below. Check out the brio beard scape. It is the best tool on the market. And like I said, right now, for a limited time, for those of you who go through my special link, this is the only place you can get this deal. You're going to get the zero blade for free while supplies last because unfortunately they do sell out. So if you wait, don't be mad and don't be emailing me if I missed as you have. Don't wait. I'm telling you, now is the time. This is 10 days stubble. Now one of the problems with having a really short beard is if you're patchy, it's going to exacerbate it. You're going to see the patchiness a little bit more. And so if you are somebody that does have a lot of patchy areas, maybe you just let that beard grow a little bit longer and maybe train that beard to lay and cover some of the patchy areas. But one of the other issues is gray hair, right? As you can see, I am getting significantly gray. Now, one of the other problems with gray is that, yeah, it makes you look older, but it also looks patchier, right? My beard doesn't look as thick as it used to because of the gray in the beard. Now, why does your hair gray on your face typically faster than the hair on your head? And really it's genetic. One of the other things that happens is your facial hair grows at twice the speed of the hair on your head, which means the life cycle of that hair is a lot shorter. And so what happens is your body is basically programmed to send signals to the hair to produce melanin. Melanin is the substance that actually gives hair and your skin its color. And at a certain point, your body sends a message to the hair like, yo, stop it, I'm good, no more melanin for you. And the more gray you have in your beard, the older you're looking, right? The longer that beard, right? The more gray it's going to look. Typically what's going to happen is if you take that beard that's gray shorter, it's going to look still a little bit better and more youthful. But if you want to take it to that next level and actually cover some of the gray, I want to show you how I do it. Because one of the things that makes you look old and bad is dyeing that hair like super jet black. Everybody's seen the dude, right? Or the celebrity that goes like jet black with his like hair and his facial hair and it looks super unnatural and just not good. And actually makes you look older and like you're trying to hang on to your youth. Alright, so the first thing you should do when it comes to dyeing your beard is look for something or a color that's very similar to your shade. So what I would recommend is look for a hair color that's actually very, very similar to your color. Alright, in terms of facial hair. Now, the other reality is that facial hair is kind of weird, right? It's got a lot of different colors typically. It might have red, it might have blonde, it might have some gray or it definitely is gray if you're getting a little bit older. But facial hair is not like a universal color as much as they are on your head. So having a little variation is fine. And so what I recommend for guys is go with a lighter shade as opposed to a darker shade when it comes to your beard color. Alright, when you go super dark, that's when it looks pretty weird. Mix it up and get your applicator tool. Now, here's where the magic kind of happens, alright? So instead of going like completely like crazy and covering everything, what I do is focus on the areas that are gray, alright? Instead of doing like everything, I want to leave it a little bit more natural, alright? So I'm going to come up there. I like to try to make it look a little bit more natural so I don't go and try and cover like every single gray hair. Alright. Right about there. Remember, you can always come back and add more a little bit later if it doesn't cover enough or you want to add more color to your beard. But for me, it's about less as more and covering some of the gray, not all the gray, alright? So once I apply it, then check it out, right? It says to leave it on for about seven minutes. Now, another tip that I'd like to give you is instead of leaving it on like the full time, what I do is basically take like two to three minutes. So instead of seven, I'm only going to leave mine on for about four. Now, as you can see, the beard dye is starting to work, right? The one thing you got to know is don't freak out. When you start to dye your beard, it's not going to be this dark when it's done. Alright, because I'm only going to leave it on for about four minutes, it's going to look a lot more natural. It's going to tone down the gray without making it like super jet black. And so I'm going to chill for four minutes. I'm going to rinse and we'll be back. And check it out. What do you think? Not bad, right? A lot less gray without being too dark, too black. Look, if you get close, you can still see I've got gray in there. It's not all covered, which makes it look a lot less obvious that I colored my beard also a lot more natural, which is something that you should do if you're looking to look young and not old or old. Or obvious about covering the gray. And then after you color, after you groom, you also got to moisturize. Now for me, I use the same moisturizer for my face as I do on my beard and the skin underneath of my beard. Guys, you've got to get into the habit of moisturizing the skin underneath for a few reasons. Number one, if you ever want to shave your beard to look like 10 years younger, you want the skin to be soft, sexy and healthy. The other thing is the skin underneath your beard tends to get a little bit dry and when it gets dry, it gets flaky. And if you're somebody that likes to wear dark colors or black, there's nothing less sexy than seeing a bunch of like chin flakes or dandruff on your shirt. And so you got to get into the habit of conditioning not only your beard, but the skin underneath it. Another thing that I'd recommend is in the shower, shampoo your beard, but also condition it. Right? Just like you do with the hair on your head, shampooing and conditioning your hair on your face is also another pro tip. Your skin is going to feel better, your hair is going to look better and your beard is going to look sexy. Gentlemen, remember, beards are sexy, but they also make you look older. And if you make any of these mistakes, they make you look extra, extra, extra old."

        "transcript": " This is a picture of me back in 2002. I was 26 years old, wildly insecure, and I based all of my identity on the way that my body looked, how muscular I was and how lean I was. This is me today. I'm 48 years old, and the damage that was done back then is something that I wanna talk about today, because putting this picture up here, like this, even today, even though I know better, even though I understand that at 48 years old, I physically am in better shape than 99% of other dudes my age, I'm still, to some small degree, ashamed that I don't look better. Here's another one. I'm a lifetime natural drug-free bodybuilder. I loved bodybuilding. I loved the whole process. I loved lifting weights. I loved dieting. I loved it all. And I love the way I looked on this day, right? That day, the day that I would step on stage is the best I'd look and the worst I'd fail ever, like in my life. And today I wanna talk a little bit about the downside to trying to make your body do something that it's not supposed to do. I just wanna talk about this because I feel like it's important and it goes under-reported. So many people are so worried about looking a certain way and oh my god, I wanna look like the guy I see on Instagram or social media on YouTube, and so you die it. You eat like nothing. You work out like crazy. You might even take steroids and do things that are super detrimental to your body. But I wanna tell you the reality. Today I wanna go over some of the downsides to being incredibly lean and having a shredded six pack, but I also wanna tell you kind of like my new perspective and the way that I basically approach fitness and diet and my body as I've gotten older because as you get older, spoiler alert, it gets harder. Everything gets harder when you get older. Putting on muscle gets harder. Staying lean gets harder. Looking good with your shirt off gets harder. It doesn't get easier. But the one thing I can say is that hopefully you don't beat yourself up and do all the self-destructive things that I did in order to basically be and have a body that was not realistic. And what I mean by that is typically we have a genetic predisposition to look a certain way. Your consistency, exercise, working out, dieting, eating right, you can have an amazing body. But going beyond your extreme or your genetic potential, this is where a lot of the issues arise. So for me, when I was bodybuilding, back in that day, right, right there, my body fat was around like 5%. I was dehydrated, I felt like shit. I had low energy because I wasn't eating carbohydrates and I was basically abusing my body. Something else that nobody tells you when it comes to low body fat percentage is that your hormones get all fucked up. Your body needs enough fat and carbohydrates in order to basically regulate all of your hormonal functions. But when you go super low, you're not gonna feel good because your energy is gonna be in the toilet. Your body fat is gonna start to drop, right? And when it drops too low, your hormones get all out of whack. Your testosterone will drop. Something else that dropped for me was my sex drive. I literally had zero sex drive back in the day. And my girlfriend at the time was super upset. She's like, oh, what's the matter with me? Don't you find me attractive? I'm like, yeah, I do. I just don't have the interest. I didn't have any friends because nobody wanted to hang out with a dude that was obsessing about his body. But the thing that really got fucked up back then was my mind because when you get down to being that lean and you see all the definition, it's intoxicating. And you feel so good about the way that you look, that specific moment, but it's not reality. It's not sustainable. And that's the thing that I came to realize is that, everybody that diets down, they think, oh, I'm gonna just get down and then I'm gonna try to maintain. It doesn't work that way. Your body doesn't work that way. It is impossible to maintain that level of leanness or that super low body fat percentage or else you literally are gonna do permanent, long-term damage. And then you start to cheat a little bit. You start to eat a little bit more and your body starts to change. And the other thing I can tell you from experience is that when your body starts to change and you've been that low, that lean, that looking good, it's depressing. And you feel like you look like shit, even though you look better than most people. Because my identity was tied to the way that I looked and my abs and being lean and being muscular, when that went away or when that started to be harder and I didn't pay attention to it, it basically, I got depressed, honestly. And that's something else you just need to understand. When you try to push yourself to a limit that your body doesn't wanna go, you may get there momentarily, but it is not gonna last. And when it doesn't last, you're gonna beat yourself up and you're going to be upset because you feel like you failed, you feel like you're fat, you feel like you're out of shape. When the reality is something wildly different than that. And so as I've gotten older, I've got a better handle on kind of like my mind, but also what is possible. And don't misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm not saying you should let yourself go and get sloppy fat, not at all. You've gotta take care of your body. And it is absolutely possible to have a great body, one that is better than like 95% of other people, but not having to kill yourself in the process and fuck up your brain, all right? Your hormones, your sex drive, not to mention a lot of other things, right? What I do now, I just wanna run through it because I feel like it's important, my diet. I wanna start there because the way that you look like out of your clothes, I can tell you what you do with your diet consistently, right? It is about consistency. In the old days, back then I was eating boiled chicken, I was meal prepping everything, I was eating sweet potatoes and chicken, like broccoli and that's it. I was literally missing out on everything, like including pizza, which life is too short to not eat pizza, right? And so over the years I've learned, it's not necessarily about eating the five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small meals a day. It's about for me, restricting my calories. Calories in, burst calories out, like that's it. That's like the magic formula of not getting fat. And so for me, I still enjoy meal prepping, all right? Because if I don't pay attention to my diet, I'm gonna get fat. I come from a long line of short fat Italians, right? Everybody in my family is short in fat, all right? When I dated my wife, when I first met her, I started to eat the food that she was cooking, because she's an amazing cook. I got up to like 185 pounds, all right? Right now I'm like 157. It's a big like fat alpha M back then. Something else that I do in terms of my diet is factor, all right? I've talked about factor a gazillion times. Not only are they today's video sponsor, it is something that has basically helped me open my eyes, that I can still eat delicious, tasty food, and I don't have to eat boiled basic boring ass chicken in order to stay on my macronutrient game. I'm explaining. I've talked about factor before, all right? Look at their slogan, fitness starts with food. There's a reason why this is America's number one pre-made meal service, right? Because they're not only delicious, they're affordable, they're convenient, and the other thing that I love is that they're crazy healthy. Not to mention crazy delicious, all right? So the way that it works, pretty simple. There's a link down below this video. You go and you choose what type of meals you want, right? For me, I go calorie smart. All the meals that I'm gonna be eating are gonna be under 550 calories. Seriously, all my meals that I get are 550 calories or less, but they've got other ones for you to choose from. Whether or not it's vegan and veggie, protein plus, keto or chef's choice, and then you pick how many meals you want per week. Personally, I go six because factors what I like to do for lunch, but you can go eight, you can go 10, you can go 12, 14 or 18, all right? So you place your order and then every week, factor's gonna get delivered right to your door. It comes in a box with ice packs. When you get it, you unpack it, stick it into the fridge, and then when you're ready, all you do is take it out, pop it in the microwave, two minutes. So this week, my meals, I got broccoli, cheddar ground beef with chili, garlic, zucchini, and red bell pepper. Sounds delicious. I also got shredded chicken taco bowl. I've had that before. It is insane. I got stuffed pepper casserole with roasted green beans. I love it. Chipotle, queso chicken, which is delicious. I've got spicy poblano beef bowl. Ooh, do you wanna, do you wanna have this for lunch? Come on. Come on. Do you want the reasons I look back there? It saves me time. I don't have to go to the grocery store and shop for all the ingredients to make healthy, delicious meal. Also, and what I love, it saves me money. Instead of ordering out, ordering Uber Eats, going out to lunch, or you go shopping, you buy something, put it in the fridge, thinking you're gonna eat it, and then you don't, it goes bad, right? Don't waste money that way. Guys, actually, let's see. Just got to pour on my scallion sour cream that it came with. Oh my God, guys, this, it smells so incredible. Jalapenos, little bit of cheddar cheese. I've also got cauliflower rice. Ready, ready, ready, ready? Oh my God. Dude! This, like, mm. Guys, you gotta try Factor.

I'm just trying to look good for my age. And I really feel like that should be the goal is look good for the body you have. I wanna not be embarrassed when I take my shirt off at the beach. Now, when I do, do I see a guy that's like young and jacked and ripped and I get a little bit weird and self-conscious? Yes, I do. But he's 27 and I'm 48, I'm almost 50. And so it helps me to be and to have a better perspective now. Back in the day, I would see somebody and I would compare myself, right? I would compare myself to them. I'd be like, oh, I need to get bigger or oh, I need to get leaner. I was never satisfied with my physique. Now, I'm not saying that you should not try to get better or if you're in the process of making your body better, then that's a bad thing. Absolutely not. It's an amazing thing. But when you're never satisfied and you're constantly chasing this idea of perfection that literally is never going to be obtained, I feel like it's an exercise in self-destructive futility. And for me, I know that it was definitely bad for me. Even though I knew that I had a good body, it was never as good as a lot of other people. And when you compare yourself and your physique to other people, this is when a lot of bad things happen. At least it did me. For me, I compare myself to who I was yesterday and who I want to be tomorrow. I try not to look at other people with envy or with an unrealistic perspective. I know that, oh, he's 27 years old. It's easier for him or, oh, he's on TRT. I'm not. I have done the things that I need to do at 48 years old to maintain a testosterone level that is in a healthy range. I have a high sex drive. My testosterone level is solid. It's in the 800s naturally. I don't take anything for that. Other than eating healthy, exercising, and doing the things I need to do, like getting enough sleep, taking the micronutrients I need, like magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc, along with some other trace minerals. In order to really give my body the tools that it needs in order to be healthy. At this age, I value health a lot more than physical looks. And unfortunately, when you are doing something that's this extreme, it impacts you not only mentally but physically. You are not healthy when your body fat drops too low and you can have chiseled six pack abs. Now, in terms of my workouts, I basically work out to failure. All right, I'm working each body part once a week. I'll work out about four times a week. In terms of my splits, I still like doing the bro split. It's something that I've done for years and it feels good for me. I love doing chest shoulders tricep one day and then back in biceps and then legs and then I'll do it again or skip a day. As I've gotten older, I put a bigger value and emphasis on health and not just physical appearance. And this is something that I didn't give a shit about when I was younger. Now I did to the point of, I knew that I didn't want to do steroids. I want to do it naturally because I'd always worked out and I always had like a good body for who I was, my age and compared to other people. But it wasn't as good as a lot of the other people that were taking gear. In today's world, oh my God, like teenagers, guys in their 20s, 30s, 40s, like everybody, it seems like is taking some type of performance and enhancing drug and it is destroying your body. I value my testicles ability to produce testosterone. I value my body's ability to basically operate optimally and efficiently. And if you're taking something that your body doesn't need, it is going to do and wreak havoc long term. You know, in terms of my workouts, it's nothing special. I go to the gym, basically I work out with weights four days a week. I do cardio every single day. Now the cardio is something that I just enjoy doing. Yes, it's good for you. Yes, it helps keep my body fat low because I'm burning calories. And if I stopped doing cardio, I would have to reduce my calories because I would gain weight. I basically am at a plateau right now. I'm at like a hundred and like 55 pounds. I feel good. Could I be a little bit leaner? Yes. Could I be a little bit bigger? Sure. But I feel good and it works with my lifestyle. I've got a much better and healthier mindset now than I did before. But part of that has come just from wisdom getting older but also seeing some of these guys that were really in great shape not be here anymore. A lot of my friends back in the day, they're not with us anymore. Bodybuilding is a very unhealthy sport when it's taken to the extreme. Whether or not it's super lean or super big, it's not good for your body. Like I said, we all have a genetic potential. Maximizing yours is fine. Taking it to the next level is not fine. And it's bad for you. Not only is it bad for you and hard on your body and your organs, it's hard on you mentally. I truly believe that me trying to get in amazing shape, getting a great six pack and being super lean, it's messed me up. It messed me up at the time, but it's messed me up even to this day because when you look at yourself through the eyes of some extreme, whether or not you are once really big or once really lean, it effs you up. It messes you up because you always are comparing yourself to that person. It's not healthy, but it's the reality. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the downside to being lean and having six pack abs today. Because in our world, all you see are the guys on Instagram, social media that have all the followers that are making all the money, but you don't see what's going on underneath the surface. When you base your identity on simply looking good, it is a recipe for disaster. Guys, the thing I wish for you is to be in great shape for your body, for your lifestyle, and to live a long, healthy, happy life."

        "transcript": " It's never been more important to make an incredible first impression. If you do, you're going to have more jobs, make more spicy sanoritas, go, oh my god, I want to date you, you're going to make more money, you're going to have more friends, the list goes on and on and on. Today guys, I'm going to go over a few strategies and tricks in order to boost your first impression prowess even if you're shy. So here's the other secret, is that if you learn to make an incredible first impression, you're going to have an advantage over 99% of other men out there. When it comes to jobs, when it comes to money, when it comes to spicy sanorita action, and the reason is because men are getting worse as opposed to better with making great first impressions, there are a few reasons for that. Before I dive into the tips on how to get better, we got to back up and figure out why we've gotten so bad. So the first reason is technology. We're over consuming technology and social media. We're interacting online, which means we're not doing as much in person interacting. We're not meeting face to face, which means we're out of practice. Number two is the casualization of style and grooming. Our style has gotten a lot more casual. And when you don't dress up for those important meetings or when you're meeting somebody, this automatically lowers somebody's impression of you if you're not paying attention. And the same thing goes for our grooming. Our grooming has gotten a lot more relaxed. Now that's good because it doesn't require you to shave every day, but the downside is that it also makes you look a little bit lazy. The next reason is we're not as good at reading cues, physical cues. You have to be in front of somebody. You have to practice and actively engage with people in order to understand body language and all of the nuances that goes into interpersonal interactions and communication. The next thing is the rise of influence or culture, which has led to unrealistic expectations. It also has led a lot of people to put on an air or an act of confidence as opposed to just really connecting with somebody on a deeper, more intimate level. When you're so worried about the way that you are perceived by others, this a lot of times will interfere with your ability to connect. And the last reason is lower self-confidence. Because of the loneliness that a lot of men feel, because of the pressures we feel, and because we see a lot of people that we feel are superior to us on social media, whether or not it's the money they have, the girl they have, the guy they have, like whatever, it makes us less secure in who we are. And in order for you to truly make an incredible first impression, you've got to be confident. But the beautiful thing is that even if you're not, you can fake it. So number one is your style. We got to start there because it starts there. We are very visual creatures. And when we see somebody, that is the first thing, the first line of defense of that great first impression. If you are dressed well, you basically have won like half the battle. One of the quickest, easiest things you can do in order to boost your first impression prowess is to dress with style, with intention, with purpose. When you look good, people automatically respect you. They view you as more attractive, and they want to connect with you. They want to be around you as long as you smell good, which right now you will come here, come here, little, little bit of that. Damn! Now, not only you look good, you smell sexiest hell. Gentlemen, here's the deal. If you want to smell sexiest hell real quick, I'm going to link down below to the newest fragrance from the house of Pete and Pedro. All right? It is Icon. This bad boy is inspired by one of my old time, expensive, fresh compliment killers, which is Creed's Milicine Imperial, but instead of $500 a bottle, gentlemen, it's under 50. But there's also a discount code down below, guys. It's going to give it to you at an even more amazing price. We also sell the deluxe sample sizes in all the fragrances, guys. So if you're not sure, you could buy a pack of these or them individually. Guys, hit the link down below. Bottom line is this. If you look good, you got to smell good, because if you don't smell good, it kind of defeats the purpose of looking good. So step number one is dress well. Step number two is make sure that you are well groomed. That includes the way that you smell. Your fragrance, don't be too overpowering. Wear deodorant. Don't have stinky ass breath, because that's disgusting. Make sure that your grooming game is strong. Your skin isn't too oily. Your hair is styled, and it looks good. All right? Now we can get on to the other stuff that's going to make you stand out from everybody else. All right? Number two is smile. Yes, I said it. There. Here it is. Gentlemen, your smile is the most powerful nonverbal communicating tool that you have. It shows people you're engaging, you're friendly, you're inviting. Now if you're shy, a lot of times you'll be in the corner, you won't want to engage, because you feel a little bit awkward. And then when somebody meets you, you'll smile nervously. Stop it, stop it, stop it. You don't need to, because here's the deal. I want you to focus on smiling authentically. We can tell when somebody's faking shit. And if you are somebody that walks into a room or you're meeting somebody, I want you to smile like you have known them forever, which means you're going to not only smile with your mouth, it's smiling with your eyes. You got to practice. Go to the mirror, literally. Go to the mirror and act like you're walking into a room. Put your hand out to shake it and smile. I want you to smile, and I want you to look friendly. When you do this, guys, it automatically connects people to you, and it makes you look better than the other dudes that are standing there all awkward. Awkward. We've gotten more awkward as men, because we've lost the ability and we're out of practice of communicating effectively and making that great first impression when we meet somebody, right? You've also lost the ability to really engage with somebody and actively listen, which is another trick to make an incredible first impression. All right? Unfortunately, when you're shy or when you're somebody that is trying to compensate for something, a lot of times we just talk. We think that if we're not talking, this makes us not confident or not interesting, which couldn't be further from the truth. People do like to talk about themselves. If you're a shy individual, if you're not comfortable being the center of attention or really engaging in terms of asking a bunch of open-ended questions, what you can do better than most people is actively listen. Unfortunately, a lot of us have lost the active listening muscle, right? It is a muscle. You've got to work it, which means you've got to practice it because we are passively consuming content online. All right? Active listening is the art of looking intently at the person, making eye contact with just something else and engaging, right? Shaking, nodding, having verbal cues like, oh, really? You don't say. That's interesting. Wow. Like saying, making the person understand that you are not only listening, you are comprehending what they're saying. Eye contact. The next thing we got to talk about real quick. I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this, but it's important that you learn to make eye contact when you're meeting somebody. Even if it feels a little bit awkward, you got to learn to do it, right? Even if you're just holding eye contact for a few seconds and then breaking gaze, coming back when you're talking or when you're listening, this is something that you need to do. If you're not making eye contact or avoiding it altogether, it makes you look shifty and shady. If you're looking down, it makes you look submissive. And so what I'd recommend when you're talking, right? Eye contact, right there. If you need to look at their eyebrows, that's fine too. Break to the left, break to the right, come back. Not down, not up, right, left, back. And the last trick for you to make a better first impression than most people, even if you're shy, is be yourself. Don't try to act like you're something that you're not. Be authentically you, but better. Or I should say, be the best version of yourself when you're meeting somebody, right? Which means you're going to speak intently. Yet it doesn't mean you got to speak all the time, but choose your words carefully. Smile, make eye contact, actively listen, engage, look amazing, smell, sexy as hell. To do those things, you are so much further ahead than most men, because most men have lost the ability to make an incredible first impression. In today's world, the people that have the ability to walk into a room and make an incredible first impression, they're going to have more job opportunities, more career growth. They're also going to be more liked. They're going to have more friends. They're going to have more opportunities. They're going to meet more spicy senoritas, because if you are perceived well in the first three seconds upon somebody meeting, and I would say it's actually faster than that, a second. You got a second to make somebody fall in love with you, or at least respect you. And unfortunately, a lot of you guys have let it slide. You've also fallen down on the job, right? Because you're not dressing with style or intention. You've gotten too casual. You're grooming. You've let it go. And I know that on social media, it's become like, okay, but in the real world, it's not. If you want to have every opportunity at your fingertips that you deserve, you've got to pay attention to the small subtle things that will make you stand out from everybody else."

        "transcript": " We as men are facing a loneliness epidemic. In a recent study, 20% of guys said they didn't have any close friends, which means despite being connected like never before across the world, we as men are feeling more isolated than ever. What's up guys? My name is Aaron Marino and I'm on a mission to help guys look and feel amazing. And part of that feeling, incredible, is developing strong personal relationships. So today guys, I'm going to talk about the loneliness epidemic that we are facing as a society, but more specifically, men. I'm going to talk about why we got to where we are, but I'm also going to talk about how to get out of this rut and how you can develop longer, lasting, better relationships. So the first thing we really got to unpack is how did we get here? Why are we becoming lonelier? Because the truth is that I feel like it's going to get worse as opposed to better unless you fix a few things and change the way that you approach relationships and friendships, which we'll talk about a little bit later in this video. But the bottom line is this. The internet has effed us in terms of friendships and feeling connected and close. We've gotten into this bad habit of just consuming content or interactions as opposed to actually interacting and having it be both ways, right? It's a give and take. Any friendship that's a good friendship, it has to be equal in terms of you give, I give, we give together and we communicate as men, right? This is how you build a friendship. You share things about yourself. They share things with you and then you have a common ground or you build a relationship on past experiences. But unfortunately because of social media, all we're doing is consuming other people's things or stuff. The other problem with this is that we get this little hit of dopamine, right? Dopamine has become a big issue. All right? We're spending so much time on the internet. We're getting little artificial hits of dopamine when we look at porn or when we surf Facebook or Instagram. And unfortunately this dopamine constantly being flushed and pumped into our brains has caused us to basically lose motivation to go out and earn the dopamine like we were intended. Culturally, things have changed in terms of what men do for fun. Now a lot of men are going to video games, which I'm not saying that there's not a time or place, but in my opinion, this is no substitute for interactions that you get when you actually meet or talk to somebody in person. Unfortunately, a lot of people when they're playing video games, they think, oh, I'm interacting with somebody. That is not the same thing as building a friendship or a relationship. You're not having shared experiences. Another reason is organized sports. People aren't going out for organized sports like they used to when I was a kid, right? That was a breeding ground. When you played sports and you were in a team environment, this was one of the foundational reasons why you became friends with certain people. When you're on a team, you not only have shared experiences, you're going through hardship and learning things together. And it's this experience that builds camaraderie and it builds a connection to one another. Something else is church. A lot of people aren't going to organize churches or religions as much as they used to. Back in the day, like when our grandfathers were kids, everybody went to church. Church was another place where you met people, you interacted with them on a weekly basis and saw them consistently. Less guys are getting married. There are more single men out there now than ever before. This is another thing that is preventing us from feeling fulfilled or feeling like we've got connections or that we're lonely. When you've got a girlfriend, okay, fine. There's somebody, but then oftentimes you're going to have other couples or relationships with other people and go and do things. And so you're going to build friendships that way as well. And then if you get married, you're going to have children oftentimes. And then when you've got children, then you're going to be seeing and hanging out with other people that have children. Then if your buddy gets married and you didn't, you know the story. He's going to go do his thing and you're going to see him less and less and less. And this also is going to leave you feeling like you've lost a friend, but also a little bit lonelier, right? Because your buddy left you to go do what guys do typically as they age and grow up, which is start a family. And you are still single. Another thing that has caused us to really, I feel, be more lonely is the fact that we're not working in the office as much as we used to pre-pandemic. Now a lot of people are working remotely. Offices or work is where a lot of times you build those friendships or that camaraderie and bond with people. We need emotional outlets as men. You need male friendships, not like just like casual like, yo, what's up, right? I'm talking like somebody that you can call that has your back that you can talk to about the things and the issues that you're facing. Did you know that 80% of suicides are men, right? This is up like big time. It is a problem because if you don't have that connection, if you don't have those relationships, your mental state will erode. You're going to feel lonelier than ever before. You're not going to have the tools that you need and the people you need around you to solve problems or basically just that outlet to deal with stress, anxiety, or the shit that we deal with is men. Guys, the other thing I just like to mention, if you are somebody that is lonely or even if you're not lonely, but you just feel like you need to talk to somebody because you've got some issues you need to deal with, I'm going to link down below to today's video sponsor, BetterHelp. BetterHelp is on a mission to make starting therapy easy, which is something that I love. Guys, there's a link down below this video. If you go through that link, you're going to fill out a questionnaire. They're going to ask you a few questions about you so that they can best match you with a therapist that's going to be best suited to help you with your needs. And the great thing is that you're going to be able to start communicating with your therapist usually within a few days. But something that I love about BetterHelp because I've had therapy, I've had therapists that weren't perfect for me and I've had some that were amazing, they allow you to change therapists at no additional charge. Therapy is a lot like dating. You may find somebody that instantly you connect with that you are like, yo, this dude or girl or whatever has my back and I really like them. But sometimes it takes you trying a few different ones to really connect and find that person. One of the reasons why I love therapy so much is that it's a safe space. And what I mean by that is I don't want to go to my mom to talk about my wife or I don't want to talk about my friend to my other friend. It's someone that I can go to that is trained to listen and then give me actionable helpful advice and it also gives me a third party perspective. Sometimes it's hard to kind of look at things from a fresh unbiased perspective, but your therapist doesn't have to sit next to you at Christmas dinner, right? Their only job is to help you deal with your issues and feel better. Guys, bottom line is this. If you are ready to talk to somebody and feel therapy could be something that you would be interested in, I want you to hit our special link down below. That's betterhelp.com slash alpha M. That's B E T T E R H E L P dot com slash alpha M to get a discount off your first month of therapy. All right, guys. So we know obviously it's a problem. How do we fix it? How do we have and find friends and make deeper connections? The few things I want to talk about now are kind of like strategies or best practices in order for you to basically connect with people a little bit deeper, a little bit more and how to handle things. All right, number one is take off your headphones. One of the other reasons why we are not connecting with people as much as we used to is that we are wearing headphones a lot, whether or not it's at the gym or at the coffee shop or just walking around. When you have headphones on, it automatically shuts other people down from talking to you because they feel like they're bothering you if they actually would want to come up and talk to you. But the other reality is they don't come up to you because you got headphones on. Number two is spend less time on your devices or on the internet. All right, here's the reason. All right, we've already talked about dopamine and the negative effects technology has on our dopamine. Well, the less time you spend at your dopamine level is going to get in check and you're going to need to get it through healthy sources, which we're going to talk about in a second. The other reason is that there was this massive study that showed the more time we spend on our devices or social media, the less connected and lonelier we feel. Third tip is get active. Find a sports team. Go to a meetup. There's so many different ways for you to connect with real people in your area, but we don't. Why don't we? Because we're scared. We're scared to go alone or we're scared to go because what if we don't enjoy ourselves? Guys, if you are serious about being less lonely, you've got to say yes and stop saying no. Let me ask you another question. What if your best friend is at that bird watching convention or at DragonCon or at that weird thing that you think that you're the only person into it? You're not. They are too. Go out, explore. Can you find people in your area that have similar interests or groups that you enjoy going to? It automatically takes one of the things away from meeting a stranger, which is not knowing if you've got anything in common. It makes the process of building friendships and relationships a lot easier. The other beautiful thing is that oftentimes they are reoccurring, whether or not it's weekly or monthly, these people are going to get together again and again and again. And oftentimes these people will do meetups or have auxiliary things, even if it's not the scheduled time that this group is meeting. Another one is intramural sports. Intramural sports is one of the greatest things you can do if you are a 20-something, 30-something, 40-something single person that is wanting to get active, out there, and engaged. The tip is don't put off reaching out. One of the mistakes guys make is they wait for the right invitation. If you are serious about getting less lonely, you need to start reaching out to old friends, the people that you know casually, but you think, hey, maybe it's worth actually reaching out and seeing if they want to get together to go do something, go for a hike, go for a run, or go get coffee, or colleagues, people that you've worked with that you think you might have something in common with. Look for people and opportunities to go and do things, and then you reach out. You be the person, you be the conduit that's putting everything together. If there's something that you always wish somebody would invite you to do, well now's your opportunity. Invite somebody to go do the thing. That way, you're going to go, you're going to have fun. You also then, if you're asking people, even if they say no, they know that you're open to doing things because people are always looking and seeking people to go do shit with, but they don't know who to ask or they're like, oh, he wouldn't be interested. If you're the person putting it out there into the world, and you put it out there in the world, typically what's going to happen from my experience is that all of a sudden you're like, oh damn, right? It just is attracted to you. You become a magnet for it. The other thing I'd just like to mention is you've got to start being more open with your emotions and being willing to communicate. If you're somebody that basically has a wall up or a guard up because you don't want to let people get close to you, this is in and of itself going to prevent you from feeling connected or being less lonely. You've got to be more open with your emotions. Don't worry. People aren't going to run from you if you expose them or express them. You've got to be willing to be vulnerable because when you're vulnerable in a communication or a relationship, it's going to connect you deeper and quickly to that person, which in turn is going to lead to a deeper friendship and connection. Anyway, guys, I wanted to do this video and talk a little bit about what I see as a loneliness epidemic. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to get better unless you take action and be the change that you're looking for. It's not going to just solve itself because we are going to continue to get more teched out and we're going to become less connected in terms of interpersonal relationships. I feel like loneliness is going to actually keep rising if you don't take control. Guys, the one thing I'd like to know down below, do you feel lonely? Do you feel like you've got a best friend? Is there somebody that you can go to to talk to if you've got some issues or you've got people around you that you feel are your tribe? Because if you do, congratulations. You need to hold on to them, but you also need to nurture those relationships. Because if not, a lot of times they will start to dwindle and you won't continue to feel that connection that you once had. Every relationship, whether or not it's a marriage or girlfriend or a friendship with a bro, takes time. It also takes caring for. It's like a flower. If you water it, it'll grow. But if you don't, it'll die."

We're going to start at 20 and we're going to go 30, 40, 50 and beyond. I am almost 50 years old and I can tell you from experience that my body and my needs have changed drastically from the time I was 20, even 30. When I hit 40, I was like, okay, it's done. Now I'm almost 50 and my God, here's the deal. Today, I'm going to go over what you need to do at the various ages, physically in terms of your workouts, dietary wise, in terms of what you're consuming, micronutrient needs, not to mention some things for you to pay attention to because as we age, certain things in terms of our health become bigger issues that you really need to pay attention to. We're going to start in your 20s. All right. For you guys that are young, congratulations. This is the easiest it's going to be. Literally, when you're in your 20s, you're in your peak physical condition most of the time. Your testosterone is rocking. Your body is looking good and you don't need to kill yourself in terms of diet, not to get man boobs and love handles. But you also are experiencing more freedom than ever before, which is why it's critical for you to develop the habits now. It's a lot easier to start good habits in your 20s as opposed to trying to play catch up in your 30s, 40s, or 50s because the older you get, the more difficult it is and the harder it is for your body to actually respond to some of the lifestyle modifications you're making. The other reality is that as you age, a lot of the things that you didn't do catch up with you. You've got to have a baseline. I talk about this often, but until you know what's going on with your body in terms of blood work, you're not going to know where it's getting weird or if it changes. It's important in your 20s to develop a relationship with a physician, have blood work done, know your numbers so that over the years you're going to have a better idea of what's changing. If you see something changing, it's a lot easier to jump on it then. In your 20s, this is the time when you really need to pay attention to a few things. Number one is your mental health. Typically what's going to happen is in your 20s, this is when men are most prone to experience some type of psychological issues. And so if you're feeling bummed out or extra depressed, you definitely need to pay attention to it. Men in their 20s and early 30s are most prone or likely to develop testicular cancer. And so it's a great idea to get into the habit of on a weekly basis feeling those bad boys in the shower, roll around, right? Feel them, squeeze them a little bit, all right? And yes, one should be or typically is a little bit larger than the other. Don't freak out. That is normal. But the deal is you've got to know if there's anything changing. If something is changing, you're going to develop any type of knot or lump, go to the doctor, get it checked out because if you catch something early, typically you can fix it. Next up, let's talk about fitness in your 20s. Congratulations. The new gains are still coming and they are strong and you're probably strong as hell too because you're young and when you're young, you're strong. The testosterone is rocking and rolling. But once again, it starts with developing fundamental habits of going to the gym on a regular basis. You need to focus on strength training to build that muscle to release that testosterone, but also flexibility. Very important. It's going to be more important as you age, which we'll talk about a little bit later, but also cardiovascular. Don't do TRT or anything stupid like that. You don't need it. If you don't need it, you don't need it. You hear me? If you don't need it, you don't need it. Later on in life, maybe you will, but right now in your 20s, you are in peak physical condition. Now, let's talk about your diet. You got to start once again, developing good habits now. If you start the bad habit of eating terrible and you start to allow your body fat to get up in terms of your body fat percentage, it's a lot more challenging to adjust or change these bad habits as you age. Stay in lean, stay muscular. Working on your body is critical. Eating healthy, making smart choices. Eating healthy is a habit. It doesn't taste bad to eat healthy. If you think that you're not eating the right thing or you're not learning to prepare your meals properly. Sticking to lean proteins, more organic food is ideal now. When you're in your 20s, you're also not making a ton of money. So it's probably not like in the cards to spend tons of cash on like grass-fed beef, but the more healthy you can do now in terms of your diet, the better off you're going to be long-term. In terms of nutrients to pay attention to in your 20s, protein. Protein is critical for building lean muscle, calcium. Right now in your 20s, your bones are still like forming and developing and calcium is a critical aspect of making bones strong so that when you're older, you don't develop osteoporosis. Vitamin D, omega-3, fatty acid, also amazing and very, very important when you're younger, right? Brain health. All right now, a lot of you are like, dude, I eat salmon once a month. That's not enough. Guys, in my opinion, you should all start supplementing supplements now. In your 20s, you should absolutely start taking a high-quality multivitamin. The one that I'd like to recommend is the Ritual Essential for Men. Ritual is today's video sponsor, but this bad boy is packed with 10. Hard to get micronutrients from diet alone. In each two capsules, you get omega-3, vitamin A, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, vitamin K2, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin E and boron. All the micronutrients in these are traceable, which is something I love. I know where the micronutrients are actually coming from. This multivitamin is amazing. I'm going to have a link down below. The link is special. There's also a badass discount if you guys go through my link. Something else I'd like to talk about right here. All right, probiotics. The amount of badass benefits that you're getting from taking a probiotic on a regular basis is insane. Do a little Google search for benefits of probiotic, but this isn't just a probiotic. This is a prebiotic, a probiotic and a postbiotic. It's got all three. It's all about supporting your microbiome. All right, gut health. You've heard gut health. Well, gut health has a lot to do with all sorts of different things in terms of you feeling amazing, looking great and just kicking ass throughout your life. A simple thing you can do is take a probiotic at any age. If you're not taking one, you need this. If you're not taking one of these, you need this. Guys, I'm going to have a link down below in the description. If you're interested in checking out either one of these products or in my opinion, you should grab both of them together because they sell a bundle and you're going to save some cash. If you go through my special link, you're going to get an incredible deal off your first month of ritual. Guys, do not wait because the sooner you start giving your body the nutrients it needs, the better off it's going to be for the long term. 30s. So when I hit 30, it was like my metabolism went f-u because seriously, all of a sudden, all the things I could eat, I couldn't eat them anymore. I gained a bunch of weight in my 30s and I got kind of fat. Now, the truth is that I moved in with my girlfriend, now wife, and she loved to cook. I loved to eat. So that was part of the problem. But 30s, I saw a dramatic decrease in my metabolism and my ability to eat crap and not gain weight. And so it's very important for you to modify your diet. If in your 20s you were eating shit, it's time to clean it up. The other thing that you're going to notice in your 30s is that responsibilities start to increase. You get a little bit more stressed out. You got a better job. Maybe you got a family. Maybe you got a little kid. 30s is a very tough time for a lot of men. A lot of your buddies are getting married. You're getting married. You're not seeing and hanging as much as you did. You don't have as much time to go to the gym and pump iron, which is why finding and developing a schedule is even more important when you're 30 and not deviating from it. When I was in my 30s, my body started to fail me. I ruptured my Achilles tendon. I had a bleeding ulcer. All sorts of weird things started to happen. And when I went to get my Achilles tendon fixed, I'm like, Doc, why did this happen? He goes, we call this the weekend warrior injury. I go, what are you talking about? I'm a stud. He goes, you were a stud. Now you're about to be old. Old. I'll kick your ass. Exactly. I got all bent out of shape, but then it made me realize, oh my God, my body is not what it used to be because your body is not what it used to be. A lot of the injuries you had when you were younger are going to start to creep up on you. If you injured your knee, if you had a bad foot, if you had an issue with your shoulder in your 30s, this is typically when you're going to start to notice. Things are getting a little bit weird, which is why it's equally, or I should say vitally important for you to make sure you stay active. You've got to stay active. Do not let your body go to shit. Just because life has got a little bit crazy. Sleep. Sleep is another thing in your 30s that you really need to prioritize. All right. In your teens, you're sleeping all the time, not an issue. You also did them a job yet or a career. So you're not super stressed out in your 20s, you know, as long as you're not staying up too late, sleep isn't that big of a deal. But in your 30s, life starts to build up in your brain. And a lot of times it's difficult to shut it off at night. And if you are not sleeping, all sorts of bad shit happens to your body. Most of the time insomnia comes from stress related issues. You know, whether or not you can't shut it off, you're thinking about money, you're worried about your job, your weird Barry, uncle Barry. Oh my God, Barry. Exactly. Right. That's all the things that goes through your head when the lights go off. And so it's very important for you to manage stress in a healthy way. All right. All the binge drinking you did in your 20s, it's got to stop. Doctors, checkups, you got to keep doing it. Once again, it's about an annual physical going and letting them basically do blood work to see where your numbers are. Once again, if you don't know where you're starting from, you're not going to know when something gets out of whack. And typically if something starts to change within that year, it's in the early stages. It's when something started to change 10 years ago that all of a sudden when you notice there's a problem, there's a big problem. Fucking 40s. Oh my God. It gets hard. It gets really hard in your 40s. Your body starts to change drastically. And even if you're eating healthy, even if you're working out like normal, things start to not look the same as they used to because your metabolism continues to slow. But something else that changes is your muscle mass. You need to prioritize strength training, cardiovascular exercise and flexibility. These three things are going to be the foundation for you feeling physically incredible and being able to do incredible things after you retire and being an old man. You don't want to be that crippled dude or that dude. They can't get off the couch because he's too weak. It starts when you're 20, but you got to keep it going. Like I said, it's about building habits for the long term. It's not just the thing you do once a week, once a month. It's a lifestyle. And if you adopt this as a lifestyle in terms of strength training, cardiovascular flexibility, you are going to basically benefit yourself. You're also not going to age as fast physically as you age. If that makes sense. All right. Now, something else that didn't make sense to me is why did I have five precancerous polyps on my colon? All right, colorectal cancer. This is when it starts to really rear its ugly head. Also, heart disease starts to be an issue because a lot of people, a lot of men didn't realize that they had any type of cholesterol or heart issue when they were younger. So when they're in their 40s, right, they finally go to the doctor and they're like, oh, you've got congestive heart failure. You've got a blockage. You've got something going on. All right. A few tests that I personally would recommend is get a colonoscopy, see what's going on. If they can jam a camera up your butt to see what's happening, right? Typically, if they find something, they can remove it like they did me. I had five precancerous polyps the first time and then you're cool. You go back in a few years up. Guess what? You got a few more. They remove those. I'm cool. I'm going to go back in another few years. You manage it. You stay on top of it. You can fix it. You don't have to go down the rabbit hole of basically colon cancer, right? Heart. I went and had a calcium score done a few years ago. Calcium score. You lay down MRI of your heart. It literally takes five minutes. It wasn't that expensive and you get a score. The higher the score, the more at risk for a cardiac event you're going to have. All right. And so for me, I was a two. The scale goes from zero as in zero detectable calcium to like a thousand or 2,000. If it's over like 150, your chances of having some type of cardiac event, AKA a heart attack in the next 12 months is like 70%. Chilling out with the alcohol is a good thing. All right. Just so you know, the recommended daily use or allowance of alcohol is zero. Like that's what's recommended to be as healthy as possible. Don't drink, but if you are going to consume alcohol, you got to do it responsibly. Once again, it's about managing your stress and not doing some of the bad habits you did when you were younger, right? I was a binge drinker when I was younger in my 20s and even some of my 30s. I also use tobacco, which is something else I just like to recommend. If you are somebody in your 40s that is using tobacco, it is bad. It is bad at any age, but as you get older, it becomes a bigger issue because if you've been using it for a while, a lot of bad stuff can happen. All right. For me, I was a smokeless tobacco user. I used to dip. I did two cans a day from the age of 18 to about 35, two cans a day, but I didn't want to be the dumbass that knew better and got cancer of the mouth and had to have my jaw removed. And so I finally did what I needed to do in order to quit. Was it easy? No. Is it possible? Absolutely. Hydration. In your 40s, your skin starts to get a little more old. And so you got to make sure you are doing the things you need to do in order to preserve that youthful look. All right. Skincare. I say that it's like fitness for your face. You take care of your body. You got to make sure in your 30s, actually, you should start with skincare. But in your 40s, you're going to start to notice a little stuff happening. Wrinkles here, wrinkles there, and you're going to be like, damn, what's happening? You're getting older. That's what's happening. But if you start a skincare routine early and you do what you need to do in terms of your diet, eating out the end, drinking enough water, one gallon of water a day, it is amazing how much younger you can look and feel, not to mention slow down the aging process. 50s. I'm almost there. And I'm actually, I'm okay with it. You know, aging and getting older hasn't bothered me as much as it did when I was younger. When I was younger, like when I turned 30, it was hard for me. But after that, it really became a lot easier. And I really feel like it's because I've become more comfortable with who I am and where I am in life. But in 50, or I should say in your 50s, it really becomes about managing issues that you've had. It's about monitoring to see where those changes are, which means you got to keep going to the doctor every single year. You got to be screened. Prostate cancer in your 50, boom, it's skyrocket. It's above 50, boom, it gets even higher. And prostate cancer, once again, very similar to like colorectal cancer. If you can just see that, oh, my PSA level is rising, right? You can treat it. You can do something about it before it becomes a bigger thing. Cardiovascular health also becomes a bigger issue in your 50s and beyond. All right. So like I mentioned earlier in my 40s, I got a calcium score. I want to know what was going on with my heart. And so they can look in there. And so if they can look, let's see, right? But even more important for you to pay attention to your body. What's going on? All right. If you can't get big out and do what big out needs to do, it's basically like your body's check engine light. Whether or not it's something cholesterol or heart related or it's between the ears. A lot of the things or sexual issues that you have are because there's something going on upstairs in terms of anxiety or stress or depression. Or whatever it may be. You got to listen to your body. You also need to make sure you are strong. All right. You got to work out. Like I said, we lose muscle mass as we age. We also lose testosterone. Like I said, it goes down. It's not going up. But there are things that you can do in terms of your lifestyle in order to boost it up and keep it as high as possible. All the things I've talked about in this video will help you maximize your testosterone and not actually need testosterone replacement therapy. All right. You got to know where it is though. Once again, it's about getting a baseline. And so you can go to your doctor when you're getting a blood test and say, hey, will you check my testosterone level so that you see where you are? And then before you actually just hop on testosterone, try to make some lifestyle modifications to naturally boost it up. One of the best things you can do is work out and lift weights. It basically is going to keep your muscles strong, keep your body strong, but also help your body release free testosterone. In terms of nutrients, vitamin D and calcium. Two big ones. Right. As we age, our bones lose density and you don't want to get osteoporosis and you want those bones to be strong. So if you fall, right, chasing a spicy seniorita, you don't break your hip. Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, multivitamin and probably co-Q10, which is great for your heart. Guys, here's the deal. Aging, it's inevitable. But how you age, this is optional. This is, in my opinion, the plan that you should focus on. If you're not doing the things that you need to do now and you're at whatever age, you can change it. But it's a lot easier to change it at an earlier age so that when you get older, into your 30s, 40s, 50s, you feel and look amazing."

        "transcript": " It takes the average person 11 weeks to fully get over a breakup, which means you've got three months to make her crawl back. And let me be clear, before you're all like it's too childish and she should just go, well, I get it. I get it. I get it. And I'm not saying that she is the one for you or the one that you should be with. If you guys broke up or she dumped you, chances are there is a fundamental problem with your relationship, but in terms of your ego and basically feeling better, it doesn't hurt when she wants you back. And so today guys, I'm going over my six step plan to make her come crawling back to you. Step number one is zero contact. I'm talking about none. No text messages, no running into her, no bumping into her, no by accident like butt dialing her or calling her when you're drunk. Zero contact for 30 days. All right. Bottom line is this. Absence does make the heart grow fonder. But if you are somebody that's burning up her phone or always like being around, she doesn't have time to miss you. It takes her 11 weeks or three months to get over you, which means even after 30 days, she is not over you. The first step is the most challenging for every guy because when you break up, you want to reach out. If you're heartbroken, you want to connect, you want to just explain yourself, have one more conversation, stop it. If you're serious about her crawling back to you and begging to get back with you, you need to do this. The other reason why the zero contact is so incredibly emotionally effective is that it gives her time to think about you. She doesn't think about the bad times with you or the times that you were controlling. She thinks about the good times. That's what she misses. She is going to focus on that. While she's doing that, I need you to focus on you. Step number two is be better. Self-improvement demonstrates growth. If you start taking better care of yourself and it starts with going to the gym, if you're already not going to the gym, go to the gym, workout, start eating better. Get your body fat down 5 to 10 pounds. 10 pounds of fat in 30 days. That's what the goal should be. I want you to do what you need to do, whether or not it's exercise, diet, a combination of both. To get your body fat down 10 pounds, not only is your body and physique going to look better, your confidence is going to skyrocket, which is sexy, but your face is also going to become more angular and defined. If you're already going to the gym and working out and eating healthy, go harder. I want you to literally get in the best shape of your life in the next 30 days. The second thing I want you to do is work on your style, because everybody is more attracted to a dude that dresses well. Style is one of those things that instantly make somebody look more attractive and feel better about themselves. When she sees you after 30 days and you are dressed well, your body obviously looks good and your clothing fits your body, this automatically is going to make her want you like crazy. She doesn't want somebody else to get you now that you're a better person. By taking better care of yourself, it signals that you're thriving. It signals that you're not fixated on her or the fact that you guys just broke up. It once again makes her curious. It's like, why? Is there somebody else? Why wasn't he doing this when we were together? 30 days. If you start using T-Shandley for 30 days, your face is going to look clean, it's going to look clear, your skin is going to pop, it's going to radiate, and you are going to be more handsome. After 30 days of using T-Shandley, guys, when she sees you, your face is going to look different, it's going to look better, it's going to glow, your skin is going to be clear, it's going to literally like pop with handsomeness. And right now, I've got a deal for you that is popping. If you hit that special link down below, guys, I'm taking all of the guesswork out of it. $9, meaning like it's a no-brainer. $9, you're going to get the starter set that comes with the face wash and also comes with your AM moisturizer that has an SPF of 20. Use the wash every morning, every night, and then use the AM moisturizer before you leave the house in the day. Those two basic things will have a dramatic impact on the way that your skin looks and feels. Now, if you want to go next level, I've also got a special deal for you on a level one system. $15, make her hava because you're going to look to damn good. That's what I personally would recommend. If you go through my special link, guys, you can either grab the $9 set or the $15 level one, which comes with your wash, your AM moisturizer, your PM moisturizer, but you also get an exfoliating scrub. Guys, the level one system, in my opinion, for $15 is what you should grab, period, because it's super affordable and literally after 30 days of using this system and doing what we recommend because in every system, you're going to get this. It's a card that shows you what time of day, do what product, in what order, even how much. Guys, we've taken all of the guesswork out of it. For 30 days, you give me and T-Janly 30 days and I will give you her crawling back because your face is going to look to damn sexy. Guys, hit the link down below. Do not wait. That link is special. You've got to go through my link in order to grab this deal. $9 starter set or the $15 level one. It's an incredible deal, $15 for four amazing products and one handsome face. That is yours. So for 30 days, you are working on you. You're also not contacting her and you're not posting on social media. I want you to basically go dark. The whole reason is because I want her guessing. I want her thinking. I want her wearing that you're out there doing things that are more fun or you're with somebody better. Now, after 30 days, I want you to send her a text message, something casual, something friendly, something noncommittal. It's literally like you've come back from the dead. She and her head thinks that you have totally moved on. Have you? No. You've been playing the game and you've been doing what you need to do to make her basically come crawling back. But when you reach back out, keeping it very casual. You're not talking about relationships. You're not talking about anything or anything significant. Something casual like, hey, I saw something that made me think of you today. She's going to be like, what? Hey, great to hear from you. What was it? And then you're going to respond with something that she likes, whether or not it was a restaurant, a place that you guys went together that she loved or you guys had a good time at. It's about triggering fond memories, which is actually the fourth step. It's about triggering positive emotions. Why is this so powerful? Because she is going to now start to think about the things that were good about you, your relationship and the times that you had. And it's going to make her miss you like crazy. Remember, she hasn't talked to you in 30 days. She has no idea. If you're dating somebody, she has no idea that you're awesome like she doesn't know. And so by being very confident and not kissing her ass and begging for her to come back or whatever, it's going to make her want you like crazy. So for about a week to two weeks, it's casual. Nothing sexual yet. That's going to be step number five, which we'll talk about in a second. But you're going to keep it very light, very playful, very fun. It's the best part of you that she misses. And then after about two weeks of casual text, what I want you to do is start to flirt a little bit. Not too heavy, not too hey. Why don't we get together and have sex? Nothing like that. Not yet. That's going to happen when she comes crawling back. Just start flirting a little bit. So I'm not going to tell you how to flirt, but little subtle things. And then I want you to take it after about a week of that, a little bit sexual. Not too over the top, but something like simple like, oh man, I really missed the way you did X or you were the best at whatever. By saying this, it's basically giving her a reaffirmation of how good she was, how much you desired her, and that you want her again. It's going to get all the juices flowing in the right ways and get her super freaking excited. You got to start slow and build and gauge her interest, gauge how she's basically responding to you. If she's responding in a positive manner, start to build it a little bit more. It's about gauging her interest. And then the sixth and final step is to wait for her to basically drunk dial you in the middle of the night. And when she does, don't take the bait. Say no. This is the final piece of the puzzle. When you reject her after she makes it a dance because you build it up, you've gotten her excited and you say no, she is literally going to be at your door the next morning or burning your phone up. She is not going to be able to get enough of you. She literally is going to be crawling back to you because you didn't let her come over. Now what would happen if you actually said, sure, come over after she like, you know, drunk dialed you and was like, yo, I'm coming over. She ran into like the reason is because she's going to be like remorseful the next day if she hooks up with you when she's drunk. All right. You shouldn't do that. You can't do that. Even though you want to, you should not do that if you truly want to basically make her desire you in a non-drunk way. Now, if you just want to hit it and quit it and you're like, yo, whatever, and then kick her to the curb like you do that, I don't care. But if you're serious about wanting to get back with her, you cannot fall for the bait. She's going to test you. She's going to throw it out there. But if you're strong and you're able to say no, that puts you in the position of power. And this is an amazing place to be. She will be crawling back on your terms."

It's a very, very tight schedule a lot of times. And they allocate a specific amount of time for you and your cut. If you're late, you could throw off the entire rest of the day. You could also rush them, which means you're going to get a jacked up haircut. I mean, hopefully you don't get a jacked up haircut, but honestly, we want to provide the best service possible. So if you're on time, we have the time to do a full service and get you looking fresh. All right, so what are we doing with your hair today? I don't really know. Really? Like, whatever you think is good. Okay. Is that, is that a bad answer? Yes, you have to know what you want before you come in. That's great. Why? Because I can't read your mind. I don't know what you want. Here's the deal, guys. One of the mistakes that a lot of men make is they'll go in, they'll be like, yeah, whatever you want to do, you can help them help you have amazing hair by doing a little research ahead of time. What I'd like to recommend is if you're not sure what style is going to be best for you or your hair, do a little Google search. If there's a celebrity that has a hairstyle or hair texture that's like yours and you want to bring some pictures, even better. Another tip I like to give people is when you get a great haircut, take some pictures. Have the stylist take the pictures of the front of your hair, the side of your hair, the back of your hair. This way, you've got a reference haircut that you can show if you have to go to somebody new. I was thinking about something like this. Can we do it? Yeah. Sure. I'm not going to get out of that cape. Which brings me to another etiquette. Got my damn hair. Don't be inappropriate with your stylist. All right. Here's the deal. They're amazing stylists, both men and women, and a lot of times are very attractive. All right. Well, here's the deal. One of the mistakes that guys make is they'll be inappropriate, which is something you should never do. You want to make sure you maintain a professional relationship. Now, the reality is that a lot of times if you start going to somebody on a routine or on a regular basis, you're going to develop a relationship. You're sitting there in over 30, 45 minutes, sometimes an hour. It's only natural that you're going to make conversation and talk. A lot of times, the conversation will get personal, but the reality is this. You never want to be inappropriate with the person at the salon or any of the staff members. That's just a good rule of thumb. Be professional and act like you've been there before. Yeah. You definitely don't want to be inappropriate with the stylist because it just makes everyone uncomfortable. They're more likely not going to want to keep doing your hair if you're going to be inappropriate with them. They're going to talk about you after you leave. Absolutely. Sorry, I got to get right over here. Wait. Do you mind if I'm on a call? Dude. Okay. Here's the deal. Phone etiquette. Put your phone away when you're getting your haircut. Don't take a call. It's not appropriate. It shows a complete lack of respect. It's also impossible for your stylist to actually give you a proper haircut if you're trying to talk and move and all that because when you're talking a lot of times your head will jostle and it will move. Yeah, especially if we're doing the trimmer and stuff. We don't want to jack up your haircut. So just stay still and stay off the phone. Is my haircut going to be all jacked up because I'm doing this? She did one. Don't vlog while you're getting a haircut. Do I smell? I do. Yeah, a little bit. Do you just go to the gym? Well, kind of. Is that bad? No, but at least take a shower. Then next rule, be clean. But I'm also going to throw in wearing too much fragrance. Nobody likes somebody that wears way too much fragrance, including your stylist. Absolutely. We don't need headaches. Also, make sure you go to the bathroom before your appointment. So that way midway through you don't have to leave because you have an oopsie. Gentlemen, pee prior. You know what? Could we go just like a little bit shorter? You couldn't have told me earlier? Well, I could have, but I didn't know. Don't wait to the very end to tell me you want it a little bit shorter. If you can see how much I'm cutting off, say, you know what? Can you take a little bit more off? I'd be more than happy to do it. But waiting until the haircut is complete is the wrong time because literally they've got to go back and re-blend like everything. It's almost like cutting your hair over again, which is going to double the time it takes to have sexy hair. If you've got to sneeze, please let me know. Also please don't come in when you're dying of sickness. I don't want to get sick. Please just stay at home. That's a good one. I never thought of that. Yeah. Gentlemen, if you're under the weather, let them know. Call in advance or when you get up, they would rather you call and say, hey, I'm sick as opposed to coming in and just sitting down and getting them sick. Yeah. I can't work sick. So I don't want to take all that time off just because you decided to come in sick. Please don't have your mother or girlfriend hovering over me while I'm cutting your boyfriend or husband's hair. Gentlemen, what is that code for? Leave her ass at home. If you're bald, don't ask me what I can do with your hair. It's like a joke of bald guys. What can you do with this? It's not funny for anybody. Definitely not. I like it. Sounds good. So I'll see you in what, two weeks? Two weeks? Can I just wait? I don't exactly know. No, my schedule is busy, man. You got to pre-book that, please. Here's the deal, guys. Before you leave, after getting your haircut, whether or not it's with a barber or stylist, book your next appointment. You know how long it takes for your hair to grow out. But one of the mistakes that a lot of guys make is they wait until it's too long. And at that point, it's really looking bad. But it's also difficult a lot of times to get in or to have that stylist fit you into the schedule. And the last and quite possibly most important etiquette rule for getting your haircut is the tip. Thank you so much, man. Appreciate it. I don't ever want to not tip your stylist. Now in terms of an appropriate amount, it really depends. What would you say, David? I mean, I will accept any tip, but I would say if you go too low, it might become a cross as offensive. So, I don't know. I would say most people tip between five to $20, just depending on your financial circumstances. And how much the hair costs. The hair cuts like $20. It doesn't make sense to tip like $20, right? If it's 50, all right, now we're talking a little bit higher end haircut. And so, you're probably going to a higher end salon or a higher end barber shop. So maybe $20 is acceptable. The other truth about being a good tipper is that when you are, you're going to get more exceptions in terms of if there is something like you're running out of town and you forgot to book an appointment and you call them up or the salon up and they know you're a good customer and a good tipper. Because if you get squeezed in a little bit easier, it's definitely better. Yes. We like good tippers. Yes. We like everybody likes good tippers, gentlemen. Be a good tipper. I hope you dug this video. Drop us one of these. This is David, Salon Posta. If you're ever in the area, hit them up. He's going to be linked and listed down below. Thanks."

        "transcript": " So when you're a young dude it's pretty easy to have incredible hair. You gotta pick a great hairstyle, you gotta use right products, but you've got hair. It's the most hair you're ever gonna have in your life. And embracing it and rocking it is important because as you age, things start to change. Your hairline will change, the density will change. You're gonna start to go gray. And unfortunately, if you are not in control of the situation, some of the mistakes that you're making are actually gonna make you look older when it comes to your hair and your hairstyle. Today guys, I'm gonna go over some unfortunate mistakes that are making you look older. So number one thing we gotta talk about is going gray and not managing that properly. Now the first thing I just wanna get out of the way, I think gray hair is sexy. Women find a man with gray hair as more mature and incredibly attractive. So you don't need to run from the fact that you are going gray. One of the mistakes and the first mistake I would like to talk about is dyeing your hair in a natural shade of dark and having like zero gray. Nothing makes a dude look more awkward in my opinion than when he's obviously a little more mature, but he dyes his hair like fucking jet black. It looks stupid. It looks unnatural. If you are somebody that is gonna be gray and you wanna actually reduce it, no problem because gray hair does make you look older. Make sure you leave a little bit. There are products out there on the market that will just reduce the amount of gray. And depending on how long you leave it in your hair or how long you actually use the product, this is going to dictate how much gray is actually covered. But in my opinion, leaving a little salt and pepper is ideal. But something else that you're gonna notice like I noticed, I've got some gray hairs coming in different areas, is that gray hair is different in terms of texture than your natural color. The hair is typically gonna be a little bit more stiff, a little bit more wiry, which means you're gonna need to learn to manage it and tame it a little bit better, which brings me to the next mistake, having wild, dry hair. Unfortunately, one of the big mistakes that guys make is as they age, they don't adjust their hair care routine. You may have been shampooing, but a lot of guys are not using a conditioner every time they shampoo. You have to understand, a conditioner is actually gonna smooth and replace a lot of the nourishment, not to mention hydration in that hair. It's gonna allow it to lay more natural and not be quite so frizzy. As you age, your hair will change and you gotta make sure that you are adjusting your hair care routine accordingly to basically make sure that your hair looks as good as possible. All right, real quick, if you have not checked out Beaton Pager, I'm gonna have a link down below. We have a quiz that will help you build a grooming routine. It's gonna walk you step by step and ask you different questions about you, basically your hair, your hair care routine, and help walk you through building a custom routine that's gonna be best suited for you. Once again, as you age, your density will reduce. And one of the things that makes you look old is having flat lifeless hair. And so, one of the things that you need to do when it comes to aging and having an incredible hairstyle is make sure you maintain the volume. A few ways you're gonna do that. Number one, get a better haircut. If you are going to a barber that's just combing it over, cutting it, and is not adding layers or texture to really boost up the volume, then you're definitely missing out and your hair's probably looking bad. All right? If you are not using something like a volumizing shampoo or conditioner, also another mistake. The conditioners and shampoos that have Byatton, not to mention Rice Protein, will go in and actually add thickness to the hair that you actually have, making it look fuller and more amazing. If you're over the age of 20, you need to be using a pre-styler like a sea salt spray. All right? The sea salt, basically you use a few squirts in your hair before you actually apply your product and style. It's gonna add weightless volume and really just boost up your hair in terms of looking thicker and fuller. And then the other product I'd like to just recommend is a texturizing powder. One of the other mistakes that make guys look older is using too much product. In thin or fine hair, if you're using too much, it's gonna weight it down and it's gonna look flat, lifeless, and you're also gonna probably see more of your scalp. When your hair is dry, simply sprinkle a little bit in your hair. That's it. You don't need much. And then you simply work it into your hair and you get the craziest amount of texture. You get volume. It's perfect for guys with short hair, a little bit longer hair, medium style hair. Guys, this stuff is incredible. Hair line. Now, one of the important realities is our hair lines will change as we get older. And one of the worst things you can do and one of the biggest mistakes I see is guys not choosing a hairstyle that is going to minimize the exposure of the forehead. The worst thing you can do when it comes to a receding hairline is expose that receding hairline. And what I mean by that is choosing a hairstyle that is not going to minimize your forehead. Instead of going with something that is up off of your head like this or slick back, which is a huge mistake, you should choose something that's going to basically give you a little bit more coverage. I'm not saying a comb over. Those are terrible. But some type of bangs, a little bit of light fringe, even curtains would do a great job in just camouflaging the fact that your hair is receding a bit because receding hairlines do make you look older. A few great styles. The Caesar cut, incredible. Also the French crop, incredible. It's about texture. It's about PC separation. And it's about basically making the hair look a little bit fuller. If you are somebody that is losing their hair and you don't want to go through the whole like finasteri, minoxidil or a hair transplant, I would just trim it short. Choose a style that's short and go with it. And when it goes, let it go. Instead, what I do is grow some type of facial hair to add balance and structure to your face. And if you're somebody that wants to get a hair transplant, go for it. I actually got to experience one. I went out to Bosley. I filmed the whole process. And one of the things that I learned when I was actually interviewing the doctor is the importance of hairline to make sure that it looks natural. One of the mistakes with going to a place that is not reputable or possibly overseas is that a lot of times they don't actually do a natural looking hairline. They bring the hairline too low on your head. You see a lot of these guys that get hair transplants and they've got like a super straight hairline that's too low. This doesn't look natural. And in my opinion, it makes you look worse. If you get a hair transplant and you literally look like a munchie-chie, right, or you look like you've got a hairline of a 12-year-old, this is not natural looking. It also makes it obvious that you did go and have something done. The next thing I just want to mention when it comes to hairstyles is embracing a style that is fitting for a mature man. All right? There are a lot of styles that are better suited for the young dudes, right? Young young dudes look great with more volume or the textured whatever or the broccoli that doesn't look good on anybody. But when you try to do something that's a little bit too youthful, whether or not it's a youthful style, a youthful cut, a youthful color, a lot of times as you age, it looks a little bit more awkward. Whenever I see a dude and he's got like a lot of like highlights or lowlights or just like a lot of stuff going on, I don't know. To me, it looks a little bit desperate and a little bit sad. There's nothing wrong with going gray. There's nothing wrong with getting older, but you just got to make sure you embrace your new hair for your age. And then you got a rock style that's conducive for your age, your density and your texture. There's nothing better than when I see a dude and he's a little bit older and he's got incredible hair. There's nothing wrong with loving your hair and wanting it to look amazing. And that's the next mistake and that is not giving a shit. It's like guys just give up. They give up. They give up on their body. They stop eating right. They give up on their skin. Their skin starts to get jacked up and they give up on their hair. They might go to like a $10 barber or like some chief place in a strip center. They're not using product, which is the next mistake. Not using product. Guys, you've got to use hair product if you want your hair to look good. Even dudes that look like they don't use hair product or use an hair product. You've got to make sure that you find the right product for the style and the look that you're going for. Which means possibly talk to a barber or stylist to ask them what you should be doing. But not using product. It's not an option. If you don't use product, your hair is going to look like shit. That is a fact. As you age, as your hair starts to get thinner, it's important to basically modify the styling aids that you're using accordingly. Because if you're using products that are super heavy or too much of it or it's too sticky, typically the hairs are going to stick together and you're actually going to see more of your scalp. The more scalp you see, the less full your hair will look, but also the bolder you're going to look. And so reduce the amount of product you're using, which is another mistake. Guys, you don't need a ton of product. And if you're using a high quality product, even better. You want to look for something that's going to be a matte finish, something light like a hair clay or a texturizing powder is going to be ideal. Fooler your hair, the thicker your hair, the more young and youthful you are going to appear. Even if your hair is not super thick. My hair isn't like super thick hair. I don't have super like thick dense hair. If I just towel dry it, if I just let it air dry right after the shower without any product, it's going to look flat. It's going to look just like normal, but it looks thick because I know what products to use. I also know how to style it. If you're interested in checking out the products that I use, I'm going to link to everything down below along with that limited time discount code. Guys, bottom line is this. Aging is inevitable. Looking old, this is optional."

        "transcript": " Any piercing from the neck down says I am freaky and down for anything. Wearing a Gucci belt as a guy says I am wildly insecure and desperate for attention. Big gold Cuban link chain says I literally could beat your ass. And an Apple watch says, Hi, my name is Brian and I'm a huge dork. What's up gentlemen, so accessories are amazing for helping you express your individual style as a man. But unfortunately some of the things you're expressing may not be what is intended. Today guys, I'm going over a few things that your accessories say about you. Please note this is just my opinion and even though you might not agree with me, it doesn't mean I'm wrong. Now, let's back up to the piercing thing. Alright, we're going to talk about body, we're going to talk about face, we're even going to talk about ears. Alright, so here's the deal. If you have a piercing in your nipples, in your belly button, or in your big out or scrotum, this basically says to the outside world I am a freak and probably a sexual deviant. A nose ring in today's world pretty much says I'm an f-boy and I'm going to steal your girl. Because chicks dig dudes that are a little bit edgier. Because typically what you're going to find is guys that have a simple nose ring like a simple stud or a hoop or even the septum piercing, these guys are a little bit bad boy. And by a little bit, I mean a lot. And so if you see a dude that's rocking the nose ring, be careful, keep your girl away from him. If he's got earrings though, he's safe. Because he's probably a middle aged dude trying to hold on to his youth with his kung-fu action grip. So earrings, what does it say? Well if they're big thick, huge gauges, it says I don't give an f what you think about me. I don't care what you think of me, I don't care about life, I don't care about getting a good job. Because you're probably not going to get a good job with big, huge gauges in your ear. And I'm just saying that is what is perceived. You're a black dude and you got big old bat rocks in your ear, it means baller. Everybody thinks or I should say you want other people to think you're a baller. And even if they're CZs or cubic zarkonians, you know it does make you look a little bit flashy a little bit more like yo, check me out, I've got extra cash. Even though you spent all your cash on your bling. But if you've got small little hoops or little studs, then basically it means, hey, you grew up in the 90s like I did because all the dudes in the 90s were rocking the hoop earrings. Some of us kept them because well, well, I'm not sure. It means that I'm trying to hold on to my youth probably. But regardless, hoops and earrings, small subtle subdued earrings, basically let the outside world that you are a little, a little counterculture. You're a little, little bad boy, but not like super bad. Next up is belts. All right. If you're not wearing a belt and your pants are sagging down off your ass, you can see your underwear. This makes you look low class, lazy and like a little boy or a punk. All right. You got to pull them up. You got to wear a belt, Gucci belt specifically in my opinion, make you look thirsty for attention or to let people know that you've got a lot of money. All right. So I just felt another expensive belt that in my opinion is a little bit more subdued, but still in my opinion is a little bit douchey. You probably do have a little bit of extra money, but you're probably not somebody I want to hang out and have a beer with. Watches. All right. Now, watches are something that I'm passionate about. So I probably have a few things to say that you might not necessarily love or agree with. All right. So number one, all right. If you're not wearing a watch, this makes you look unreliable or like you have zero clue in my opinion. Being a watch sends the message subliminally that you're reliable and you're responsible. And if you've got a stylish watch on, it also is a great conversation piece, not to mention an amazing accessory, which brings me to something that's not amazing. And that is a tech watch. All right. Even though you can check your emails and even though you're like, but I can, I can, I can talk in any thought. No, it's not stylish. All right. What that says to me is that you are more about function versus fashion. You're also probably not super like awesome when it comes to style. Richard Meal or one of those like super premium expensive, crazy expensive watches said, yo, I'm a badass. I get lots of pus because I got tons of money. Whatever. Right. I'm not saying that they're cool. I'm just saying that's what people think. Rolex says to me that I am a classy gentleman who appreciates quality and craftsmanship and the timeless elegance of an amazing watch. All right. If you're somebody that wears an AP, same thing. If you're wearing a Cartier, something a little bit more subdued, something a little bit less flashy and not as well known, but equally sexy. All right. Or if you're wearing something like a Patek, now we're talking about elevated like honestly, when I see a dude and he's wearing a Patek, I typically don't notice him because most people don't notice a Patek watch. They're super premium. They're amazing pieces, but they're more about people that have made it. They've got FU money, but they don't feel the need to actually show it or flash it. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars to get a great watch. Right. There are a ton of incredible brands out there. The Orion, awesome. Seiko, amazing. Casio even. Great. All right. Hamilton, another great brand. But the brand that I'd just like to tell you about real quick is this Aura. Is a new watch brand that has been crushing it. They've been blowing up. All right. I first heard about them. I saw this article and I started looking into them. I'm like, wait a second. These guys are doing something different. They are offering a super premium quality watch for an incredible price. And the price, like I said, is literally unbelievable. You get stainless steel. You get a sapphire crystal. You know, some of their watches have Japanese automatic movements. They are just absolutely perfect. Right. Check it out. The open case back right there. The black murdered out aura is so clean and sexy and the band, the strap, it's just got a little bit of bling. Not too much though. Or maybe this. You like this one better, right? Steel, white face. It is so clean. It is so sexy. And for the price guys, that's the thing. Right now, if you go through my link, there's a discount for 30% off. All right. The price is insane. You got to just go with 30% off. Makes this a huge no brainer. If you're somebody that wants to treat yourself and upgrade your watch game, but they've got something else also. They've got a few watches like the 41 millimeter that literally looks the same as a 40 that is marked down to $170, but you also can apply that 30% off discount, which makes it like $119. Here's another one that's marked down. I love this. It's the turquoise face, all right, with the steel, super sexy. Here's another one that's been marked down. I absolutely love this too. It is super clean perfection. Once again, it's marked down to $170, but you can use that 30% off, which makes it like $119. Guys, you also can grab the rubber straps. All right. Aura also sells super premium straps that you can actually switch and put on any of the Aura watches. You can use the discount on that as well. Aura also has chronographs that are so incredible. I'm telling you, guys, Aura makes badass watches. That discount, you can't beat it anywhere. It is the best deal you're going to get on one of the best watches I've ever had the pleasure of rocking. Guys, hit the link down below. Use that discount code to get 30% off a sexy ass watch. Next up, we got to talk about necklaces, pukashells, or any type of shell like Joker. It makes you look like you just got back from Panama City and you're 12 years old. Somebody give me a pukashell necklace. I'm going full douche. Long necklaces that are made with leather straps or have a big pendant or a big crucifix makes you look a little bit low class. Now, if you're wearing something with a lot of bling, this once again is sort of similar to the big diamond studs. It makes you look like you're showing off a little bit and like you got some extra cash or you want to make people think that you do. Simple, subtle silver or gold chain in my opinion is one of the greatest necklaces out there for guys. There are a lot of incredible options out there these days. What I love is when I see one with a small, subtle pendant, maybe you'll string a few pendants together on a single chain. In my opinion, this looks super high class. It also makes you look a little bit more elegant and refined. Because some necklaces definitely don't make you look refined. If you're wearing too many of them, this also once again makes you look a little bit like you're trying too hard. Remember, with accessories, less is oftentimes more. Next up, let's talk about bracelets. Once again, a simple metal cuff looks amazing. Something simple, something elegant, something that's gold or silver, these look amazing. A great example of this is the Cartier bracelet. They make a lot of incredible, expensive, but incredible bracelets for men. I've seen the one with the nail, it looks like a nail wrapped around. This also is super premium and lux. Most people don't notice it, but the people that do know, they know you spent some bucks and a narrow on those bracelets. A simple, less expensive gold cuff, silver cuff, fine. A big thick leather one, not good. Big leather cuff makes you look like a redneck. I'm just saying, or a country music star. You probably have Ed Hardy jeans on and a flannel shirt with the sleeves ripped off. I'm just saying, that's what it looks like. Beaded bracelets, I think beaded bracelets are good. I think they're a good segue. You'll see a lot of middle-aged guys that are like, yo, I'm cool, I'm accessorizing with a beaded bracelet that'll have like an Apple watch on the other wrist. It really has to go with your aesthetic. Certain guys can get away with wearing more jewelry than others, but it really boils down to the overall aesthetic and the look that you're going for. If you are like a math teacher in terms of your style and you're rocking bracelets, it makes you look like you're trying a little too hard to be cool. Next up, let's talk about Ring-Bling. So if you wear a silicon wedding band, you see them a lot. It makes you look or makes people think that you are into working out. You're a cross-fitter, you lift weights on the regular, you probably do cold punches, and you definitely listen to Joe Rogan. And your hero is David Goggins. Now, here's the problem. A lot of guys will be like, yo, I'm going to wear multiple rings on a single hand. Here's the deal. A pinky ring makes you look like a mob boss. A thumb ring, how do I put this nicely? I can't put it nicely. Don't wear a thumb ring, all right? Ring on your middle finger, your index finger, any other finger other than your ring fingers, in my opinion, is something that should be done with very, very extreme caution. Hats. Exactly. See, what do you think when you see a dude wearing a hat like this? Exactly. He probably knows magic tricks, and he plays, I don't know what he plays. He plays with himself. I'm kidding. What I'm not kidding about is baseball hats, though. Baseball hats are kind of a love-hate thing for me, right? I love baseball hats. I don't love a lot of the things that I see with baseball hats. If they're worn out, if they're dirty, I think it's disgusting, and I think you look a little low-class. Unfortunately, all right, yeah, West Virginia, what, what, man, actually, the mountain here suck, it's my school, unfortunately, all right? I like a trucker hat. I think they're still super popular. I think they also make you look a little bit more rugged. Sports hats also great. I've actually changed my mind. I used to say, don't ever wear your hat backwards or else you're going to look like a punk. I don't think that's true. I see a lot of guys wearing them that I think look great, but I will say this. If you are going to be wearing your hat backwards, it is going to send the message that you are more youthful and you're a little bit younger. The bigger hats, like cowboy hats, I think if you're a cowboy, rock the hell out of it. The other ones that are a little bit more like hipster inspired, the big flat, like bigger ones, I think you look like a hipster, which there's nothing wrong with that, but you definitely are cooler than me. Bags, all right, so let's talk about it. Backpacks in general make you look a little bit younger, all right? If you're wearing something unstylish, all right, that looks a little bit more like youthful, this makes you look like you're five years old. They do make backpacks that are a bit more sleek, a bit more stylish. They also come in leather and different fabrics are basically going to upgrade the quality and the aesthetic. If you're rocking a leather backpack or something that you're going to find out there, it's going to be a few hundred dollars, but it is definitely going to be a little bit more mature, a little bit more refined. If you're rocking a bag that is a little bit higher end, it is going to send the message that you do have some extra money and you're not afraid to spend it, because typically these bags, like I said, are expensive. Glasses, let's talk about glasses, all right? Glasses like these make you look like Uncle Barry, all right? What I would look for when it comes to eyewear is something with a little more structure or substance to your frame. There are so many amazing glasses brands out there, right? If you're wearing something with a simple frame or no frame at all, it makes you look like you really aren't into style. It just means that you need glasses. Don't think of glasses as a necessity. Think of them as an accessory that you're lucky enough to wear on your face. These glasses literally cost me like twenty seven dollars from GlassUSA.com. They're incredible, right? There are a lot of incredible glasses out there and brands out there that have great-looking glasses that aren't going to break the bank. Warby Parker also another one of my favorites. They've got a huge selection. You can go in, you can try the different styles on, and typically you're going to find a pair for under a hundred bucks. Sunglasses, all right? Sunglasses are one of those things that instantly make you look cool or instantly make you look like a bit of a dork, all right? So here's the deal. The sports sunglasses, they have come back into style, all right? Similar to the Mollit and the Mustache. If you're doing your rockin' like the Blades, then congratulations, you also are cooler than me. And it also shows that you're playful and fun because that's really what that signifies to a lot of people, that you're fun and you don't take yourself too seriously, all right? But a great style option in terms of sunglasses are the classic styles. The Ray-Band Waybear, Aviator, or the Clubmaster. If you're rockin' across body bag, this says that you're a little bit more youthful. It also says that you are definitely on trend and in style because cross body bags send that message at least to me, but probably everybody else. The last thing I want to talk about are wallets because wallets, once again, can send the message that you're cool or that you're a lazy slob. If your wallet is big, if it's packed, if it's got a bunch of receipts and cards, this makes you look lazy, it also makes you look unorganized. Instead, what you should look for is something sleek, something minimal that you can carry in your front pocket. Once again, the brand Coach has a lot of incredible wallets. There's so many amazing options out there in terms of accessories. You don't need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to look good. A lot of the accessories that you're gonna wear to upgrade or elevate your style are affordable, they're optional, but if you choose the right option, you are gonna look amazing."

        "transcript": " Ugly. A lot of us feel ugly or unattractive because we don't look like the guys we see on the YouTube channels or the Instagram accounts. But the good news, for you guys out there that don't feel like you are the 1% in terms of looks, there's some good news and some things that you have in terms of advantages over the guys that are great looking. Today, I'm going over some powerful reasons why being ugly is better than being attractive. Starting with, number one, you're probably going to be more successful than them. Now, the data shows that if you are attractive, you're probably going to make more money in your job. But attractive people do not have the drive or the motivation to do something amazing like you. Do you think for a second that Mark Zuckerberg would have created Facebook if he was a Chad? No way. And Elon, do you think Elon would be Elon if Elon was some chiseled Greek god and he got a lot of puss? No way. What about Jeff Bezos? I'm just saying. He's a stud now because he's on TRT and he's got super hot models and has created one of the most powerful companies in the world. But back in the day, you think he'd be what he was if he was a stud. The answer is no. Or one more, Bill Gates. Bill Gates was the biggest dork ever. These dudes, they all have chips on their shoulder. And instead of them going out and chasing all the ass or having people fawn on them or telling them, oh my god, you're so amazing. You're so beautiful. Instead, what did they do? They're like, fuck it. I'm going to focus. I'm going to dedicate myself to my craft or this thing. And the interesting thing is that when you actually do that, you will become more attractive and desirable just as a byproduct of you being successful. Just because you're not hot now doesn't mean that when you're successful, you won't be. Number two, you have a stronger self identity. Instead of you going out and reaching and searching for validation through other people telling you you're good looking or you're hot of your handsome or you're getting girls. Instead, it forces you to really analyze yourself as a person and know who you are. The fact is, if you are comfortable in your own skin, regardless of how you look, you are attractive. Number three, you've got deeper connections and relationships with people because people get to know you for you and that's what they love. It's not just because you're pretty. It's not just because you're attractive or popular. It's because you are a good person. Number four, you're not going to feel the need to obsess about plastic surgery or doing stupid shit to your body that's unhealthy just to look better or fit in or make somebody think you're pretty. All right, TRT steroids. I look at all the dudes that are in on steroids and taking performance enhancing drugs and I'm just like, what the fuck are you doing, stupid? You're ruining your body. You're shutting down your testosterone production. You're destroying your testicles. Just what? Just what? To get somebody to be like, oh, he looks good with his shirt on. Like congratulations. You've got big biceps, but you also now are bald, losing your hair. Your testicles are this big and you've got acne. Guys, you can do something about all of it. If you want a nice body, eat right and work out. It's consistency. Do it consistently. Your body's going to look amazing. All right, if you don't have a great body, it's because of your lack of discipline. If you're losing your hair, you don't want to go to Bosley, get Benastride, get Propecia. It'll stop your hair loss. If you got acne, hit the link below. Check out this. It is the new Teach Clear system acne treatment by T. Shanley. So guys, here's the deal. You know T. Shanley skincare, but something we've been doing now is researching how to make an acne system that will completely not only treat and cure your acne, it will prevent it from coming back once and for all. We have done a lot of work, a lot of research to create the perfect acne system. Guys, men's skin is different than women's. Our skin is thicker. Our pores are bigger. We're oilier. And so your acne system basically needs to take this into consideration. And that is the reason why our system at T. Shanley is cutting edge. 80% of the people that switch from another acne treatment to ours, saw better results. All right. It's three steps. Wash your face twice a day with the salicylic acid wash. This stuff is amazing. And then after that, you're going to use one of these glycolic. We use both salicylic and glycolic pads all over your face. All right. You're going to wipe it all over your face. And then after that, you're going to use this, which is an acne serum. You apply this all over your face. That is it. Three steps, three products, link below 40% off. Each of the systems comes with this. It's an instruction card that tells you what time of day to use what product in what order and even how much. Guys, all the information will be linked down below. That link is special. It's going to give you 40% off your first T. Sh. Clear system. Guys, if you're ready to eliminate your acne, hit the link, let T. Shanley help you have amazing skin. The next reason why being unattractive is actually better than being good looking is that you learn resilience. You're tougher than people that are good looking because a lot of times they have gotten a lot of handouts. A lot of people just give them things or our friends with them or give them opportunities because they're good looking. Right? If you are somebody that isn't classically amazing looking, you've got to basically fend and fight for yourself. You've earned everything that you have. Nobody's handed you shit. You've also faced rejection and you don't rely on external validation in order to build yourself up and be who you were destined to be. A lot of times when you grow up with adversity, whether or not you're poor, you're not attractive or you've got a disability, it forces you to really do better. You are stronger because of it. Even though it sucks, even though there's probably a time where you're super insecure, wishing, oh, I wish I was better looking or I didn't get the girl or whatever, it's made you stronger. It's made you a stronger man. It's made you a stronger individual. It's made you into a better, more well rounded person that does not rely on external validation for feelings of confidence, security and self-worth. You are self-sufficient. You're also intrinsically motivated. You're not relying on the praise. You're not relying on people telling you you're awesome all the time in order to build yourself up. You get it from doing the things that you enjoy doing. You get it by working on the things that you enjoy working on. You get it by developing things like your mind or your hobbies or your business or your career. This is something that in the long run will pay off. The other thing that you've got that they don't is the ability to age without freaking out and being all devastated when you lose your good looks. This is just me being honest. I look at all these beautiful women, all these beautiful men, all these dude with six pack abs, all these 18 year olds that are like, yeah, you can have chiseled abs like me. Fuck you, dude. You're 16. You're 18. Talk to me when you're 50. Talk to me when your metabolism slows down. Talk to me when you age. I see all these women, right? They're getting all the injections. They're doing all the stuff to their face. They're 19, they're 20. It's going to age like shit. They are going to look so bad when they're 30. It's ridiculous. The dude that's taking steroids when he stops, guess what? He's going to get fat because he hasn't adjusted his diet. He also is going to have horrible testosterone, bad testosterone, low testosterone because you've been on TRT before you needed to be on TRT is going to wreak havoc on your body, not to mention your mind. And the other thing that happens is that when you are used to having a great body or being amazing looking, when that fades, once again, it destroys your ego. Looks fade. That's the reality. Looks are a depreciating asset, but what's not is money. What's not is your mind. What's not are your friendships. What's not are your family, your friends, the people that love you, that surround you because you are amazing. I know that it sucks not being super great looking or having girls not look your way because you're not as good looking as the other guy or whatever. I get it. I get it. I get it. I've always been insecure about my looks, right? Whether or not it's my pointy ears, my big nose, my deviated septum, my birthmark in my eye, right? The fact that I'm short, I've always been insecure. But what I've done to compensate, I've dressed really well. Dressing well is the great equalizer because dudes that are dressed well, the dudes that work out, the dudes that have nice bodies, which is something that I focused on as well, have an advantage. I also groom myself really well. You think all this is an accident? No. It was crafted and cultivated in order to maximize my God-given potential, right? The beard. If you're a little bit unattractive, grow a beard. Boom. Automatically, it's going to strengthen your jaw and make you look a lot better. Be well-groomed. Have good hair. Hair is another one of those things where I've always had good hair and it's something that I'm very proud of and I've cultivated. I've nurtured it. My skin, another one of those things that I've always been super passionate about and that's the reason why I started T. Shanley because I wanted other guys to feel great about their skin. I wish I started taking care of it when I was younger. But my body, my style, my grooming, these are the things that we can control. We can't control our bone structure. We can't control our height. We can't control a lot of times like our voice or the fact that we're not super manly. No, we can't. That's fine. You can control a lot of aspects that can drastically improve your physical appearance and your feeling about your appearance. I don't believe that anybody is ugly. There are things that you can do to feel better about yourself. There are things that you can do to feel more confident. But the reality is this, if you are somebody feeling unattractive, I get it. There are things you can do, but the one thing you've got to understand is that you have advantages over the people that are just great looking and that's all they've got to offer. Sure, they may get the girl. Sure, they may get a lot of followers. Sure, they may get a lot of people saying, Oh my God, you're so sexy and whatever. Are they confident? Well, maybe. But the other truth is that this confidence a lot of times is fragile and it is fleeting and it will go away because they relied on their looks as opposed to developing their character, their moral compass, their friendships, their mind, their passion, their hobbies, the things that are really important. Guys, be confident. We may not all have Greek God like good looks. We may not all be six foot two chiseled studs, but the fact is if you're not, you actually have some advantages over the dudes that do."

        "transcript": " So when I started posting YouTube videos back in 2008, the goal was simple. I wanted to help guys feel great about themselves, confidence, right? If you feel good about yourself, anything is possible and you're going to live a more inspired life. And the reason why I made this my mission and my goal is because I wasn't given that resource when I was growing up. I wish I had an older brother. I wish I had a father that sat me down and taught me some of the things that I would end up sharing that I had to learn the hard way. Well, today this video was for you guys out there that unfortunately didn't have the role model that maybe you needed or wanted. I know that in my heart, I should say, I don't know this. I feel like everybody does the best job they can. And in this includes your parents, including your father. I feel like, unfortunately, a lot of our fathers aren't present in the way that they should be. A lot of you come from broken homes. A lot of you are raised by women, not a bad thing. All right, you're doing the best job you can. And so did they. But unfortunately, a lot of them don't have the skills or never learned this through their father or through their resources. And so today I want to go over a few things that I wish my dad taught me that I want you to know. Number one is it'll pass. It will all pass regardless of how you're feeling right now, whether or not it's lonely or sad or you're heartbroken or you just don't see a way out or maybe you're poor and you don't want to live this life. I promise you, if you focus, if you pay attention to the things that matter and don't get distracted, it will pass. You've just got to keep working and you can't give up. The second thing I wish I knew earlier was don't try to be popular. Try to be good. All right. Did you hear that? Pretty people, we give them a pass in today's society. I want you to focus on being the best person you can. And if you do, I promise you, you're not only going to feel good about yourself, other people are going to be drawn to you and attracted to you because you are not putting on an actor, putting on a show, which brings me to number three. Do not try to be somebody that you're not because the fact is you're amazing. You might not have the best job or the best money or the best girlfriend or the best life right now, but I promise you, you will if you keep working. Don't bitch and wind to anybody. If you're not willing to roll up your sleeves and actually do the work because nobody owes you shit. Stand up for yourself. Nobody else will, but be nice to the little guy because it's some place and point in our life. We will all be the little guy. Shitty things happen to good people, but it doesn't mean you've got to allow those actions or these bad situations to dictate your future. And that's something else I just need you to hear. Just because you are somewhere now doesn't mean that's where you need to go. My dad, he didn't grow up with a lot of money. He didn't grow up teaching me about financial responsibility or how to make money. He didn't have that skill set. And so we never passed it down to me, which is something else you need to learn. And that is money. You need to understand money. You've got to get educated. There's a language that's associated with it, but you burning your head in the sand or just because your parents or your family or people around you don't have a lot of money, doesn't mean that you can't. You can have a lot of success and wealth, but it's about being smart and being disciplined. Not only that, it's about learning and understanding money. I never learned that. I wish I did. I'd be better off financially if I had, you have every opportunity at your fingertips. It doesn't matter if you're black or white or gay or straight or brown or Asian or it doesn't matter. If you want it, you can figure it out, but it's going to take you doing the work. It's going to take you rolling up your sleeves, which brings me to something else. Do not be afraid of hard work and do not allow somebody that is pretty to take advantage of you. And this is something that I am super passionate about, because unfortunately I see a lot of pretty people doing some horrible things. I see a lot of pretty people or popular people getting advantages that most people don't have just because they're popular or pretty. You've got to look at somebody for their character and you've got to have integrity. And that is something else that you need to understand. Integrity is important and treat yourself with respect. Oftentimes, unfortunately we treat other people better than we treat ourselves. You got to stop abusing yourself. Do not smoke, do not drink, do not do drugs, do not sleep with people that you shouldn't. Do not self sabotage your potential awesomeness. Every single one of you has amazingness just lurking and ready to break free, but you're stifling it because of your mindset. You're stifling it because of your family. You're stifling it because of your inability to focus and your lack of discipline. Discipline is the great equalizer. It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much talent. If you're disciplined and have the ability to work really hard and you're smart and you're not getting distracted or letting your friends talk you in the things that they shouldn't be doing and you shouldn't be following them. Do not be a sheep. Lead. Be a man. Stand up for yourself. Do not allow somebody else's inability to dream big to impact you just because your parents didn't do something that was wrong. Didn't do something or they tried and they failed or just because your friends might not be or have the same driver motivation and don't have any dreams of being bigger or better than they are right now. It doesn't mean that you can't and you shouldn't. And just because they didn't doesn't mean you won't or you can't. Do not settle for mediocrity. Unfortunately, the people that I grew up around were mediocre. They were average. It's not that they weren't awesome people or that they weren't like smart and sweet, but they didn't have the ability to think big. Do not allow somebody else to control your destiny and do not live a life that somebody else wants you to live. If it's not what is in your heart and it's not what you want. Don't let anybody tell you who to love. That's your choice. Life. It's short. Something else that I've realized. You also need to tell the people that you love now that you love them. Have the ability to communicate. Speak what's on your mind. Do not shut up. Do not sit down. Do not take a back seat. Do not allow anybody to treat you poorly. It's not okay. It's not okay for a woman. It's not okay for a man. It's not okay for a parent. It's not okay for a friend. You deserve that people in your life that love you, that respect you. And if you don't get rid of them, if you are not going to have high standards for yourself, if you are not going to be disciplined, if you are not going to be disciplined enough to say no when you need to say no and only allow the people in your life that deserve to have you, you're going to have an uncomfortable ride. You're also not going to live the life that you deserve. Nothing is guaranteed. Nothing's easy. And the hardest things you're going to ever have to do are probably going to be the most rewarding, but it's worth it. But you've got to take action and you've got to take initiative. And just because nobody in your life has done it before doesn't mean you won't or you can't. You are amazing. And I believe in you. I just wanted to tell you that today. I feel like some of you probably need to hear that. I know that I did when I was growing up, but unfortunately, I had to learn it the hard way."

        "transcript": " Alright gentlemen, grab a trash bag and come with me to your closet. Actually, we're going to my closet because even I need to purge my shoe collection from time to time. The deal is you're a man. I'm a man. We are men, which means we should not be wearing some of the shoes that unfortunately a lot of the younger dudes are wearing or we've been wearing for way too long. Today guys, we're purging starting with number one, any shoes that are just ugly as fuck. The truth is we all make bad buying decisions from time to time. We may see something, we're like, damn, that's awesome, right? Or we see it on somebody else, we're like, yeah, I kind of dig it. Maybe I should rock it. And then you buy it and then you don't wear it, which brings me to the next pair of shoes that I need to trash, which is these because I literally have never worn them. It doesn't matter how much you spent on a specific pair of shoes. If you don't wear them, why do you have them in your closet or wardrobe? Alright, something else I got to talk about. Sandals, flip flops, anything that's showing your toes, gentlemen, you got to toss them if you're not going to be foot responsible. Foot responsible means that your toes aren't all effed up and nasty. You got to make sure if you're exposing those tootsies, your tootsies are straight. My tootsies were not straight when I cheated on Thursday boots and actually bought these, which is the next pair of shoes that you need to toss. And that is anything that is not broken in, even though you thought it was going to break in. Alright, so here's the deal. I was in Austin. I was with my buddies. I wanted a pair of boots. I didn't bring my Thursday. So I was like, yo, there's a boot store. I'm going to go buy a pair of boots. I was like, yo, they're kind of cool. I put them on. I'm like, yeah, they're not the most comfortable things, but I think I can rock them 20 minutes later. Bleeding. Literally, my ankles were bleeding because of the hard leather. They just weren't comfortable like Thursdays. And I got spoiled, right? Because Thursday boots, you just slip them on and boom, they're comfortable right off the bat. Another pair that I need to toss are these. Alright, these are Chelsea boots. They are black Chelsea boots, not bad, but the toe way to point the toe box. See how pointy the toe is on these boots, right? I still have them in my wardrobe in my closet because I haven't purged. I got to get rid of these because they're not in style anymore. What you're looking for in terms of a boot is something with the more natural toe box. Let me show you these. Alright, this is what you should be looking for. It's not overly dramatic. It's not super pointy. That's out of style. It's not super square. That's out of style. It's not big. It's not bulky. Alright, notice the profile. It does have the lug sole, which makes it a little bit more rugged of a boot, but it's perfect. Alright, you can wear these with jeans. You can wear them with chinos. You can wear them with corduroy. They look amazing. Alright, these are one of my favorite rugged Chelsea's that I own. It's from Thursday boots, of course, guys. I'm going to link to them down below if you want to go check them out. It's a matte black Chelsea super sick, super sexy. Another one you guys might love like I do are these. Alright, it's got a cap toe, a little more detail by the toe, but still the natural toe box. Alright, nice and clean, perfect proportion. And that's the other thing that I love so much about Thursday's other than the fact that the price is insane for the quality. Another one of my favorite Chelsea's right here. Once again, the toe box. It's nice and natural. Another one of my favorite Chelsea's that I own from Thursday's right here. It's a little bit more distressed, but it's super clean, super sexy. You guys are going to love it. The other thing you're going to love about Thursday's guys is the fact that they're direct to consumer. The reason why they can offer you such a high quality product for the price that they do is that they've cut out the middleman, which means you get a super badass premium boot for an incredible price. Another pair of Thursday's that you guys might want to check out is perfect for fall. Alright, it's the Chukka. This one is called the Scout. By Thursday's, it is super premium. I love the suede. The suede adds a richness and texture to your outfit that really sets you apart from other dudes. Something else that sets you apart are these. These are so sexy. It's a pair of wingtip lace up Thursday's. Alright, it's got some broguing right there. They're clean. They're perfect. They are sexy. You can throw these on with chinos or jeans and look like the man. But check it out. They also come in black. Alright, I love these boots so much. They are so sexy. Guys, hit that link down below. Thursday boots makes the best boots on the market and for the price you literally cannot beat them. They've got boots. They've got jackets. They've got sneakers. They've got anything you need to look super sexy and smooth this fall or winter. Guys, hit the link down below. Thursdays are the best. Boach shoes. If you're an adult dude and you still have a pair of these bad boys in your closet, check it. Get rid of them. Alright, also those sparrows, super terrible. So are look at me sneakers. The sneakers that are like, yo, look at me. I'm so cool and flashy. Ow. Something else that's out are toms. Tom's. Tom's suck. Someone else that sucks is dirty sneakers, dirty shoes, dirty anything. Gentlemen, bottom line is this. If you want to and consider yourself stylish, you got to take care of your shit. If your shoelaces are worn out or if they're like gnarled and frayed, get rid of them, change them out. If your shoes are dirty, clean them. If the soles are scuffed, fix them. Gentlemen, bottom line is this. The shoes that you're wearing should be clean, sexy, and presentable. But what's not presentable is hey dudes. I'm just saying, you guys have all seen that like hey dude thing. If you're an adult dude rocking those, you are not stylish. I'm talking zero stylish. Something else that makes you zero percent stylish are those like functional, comfortable dress shoes that have like the athletic shoe bottom, but the business upper, gentlemen, this is like the mullet of shoes. It doesn't work. Cole Han, I'm looking at you. Johnson Murphy, you suck. Why did you do this? It's like a hybrid shoe that sucks both ways. You can't wear it to the gym. You can't wear it to the office. It just sucks. Dad sneakers, that whole trend, it sucks. The big bulky monster shoes also suck. If you're a young dude and you want to rock and find, the problem with them is that a lot of times are very expensive and they go out of style. They're actually already out of style. So don't waste your money. Also don't waste your money on super pricey premium shoes that really aren't that premium. I'm talking about all those like super expensive white minimal leather sneakers like Common Projects, Koyo. Stinky shoes. Gentlemen little boys have stinky feet. They've got stinky shoes. And if you can smell your shoes, or if they're at all funky and fresh, you got to get rid of them. Stick them in the, don't stick them in the freezer. Get new shoes and then take care of them. All right. Means don't wear them bare foot. All right. Or if you're going to go barefoot and not do the whole no-show socks, which is what you properly should be rocking, which actually looks like this. Can you see it? Can you see it? No-show sock. Yeah, exactly. Gentlemen, no-show socks, they look like you're not wearing socks, except your feet aren't going to be sweaty and a messy disaster in your shoe. Or you could also sprinkle a little powder inside your shoe, banging around to absorb the odor, the wetness, and the bacteria that actually forms if your feet are disgusting. Crocs. Did I mention crocs yet? A lot of young dudes are rocking crocs again. Not cool, not stylish. Avoid them. Also, sneakers with everything. All right. And I'm not just talking about like running shoes. I'm talking about like sneakers with everything. Even if you got a sweet-ass bare minimal leather sneakers, it does not work with everything. You are not dressing business casual if you're rocking sneakers. You got to dress it up. You got to elevate it, which brings me to the next thing. And that is dress shoes that do not match your outfit. And what I mean by that is certain dress shoes have certain levels of dressiness. A super shiny shoe typically is going to be a little bit more dressy, the most formal of options. And so you trying to dress it down with a pair of jeans doesn't work as well as something that's a little bit more matte in terms of texture. You also need to make sure if you are going to be rocking dress shoes, guys, that they're not super trendy. All right. The overly pointy or flipped up things or anything that you get from Aldo basically sucks. I'm just saying, like Aldo, I used to love it like years ago, probably like 15 years ago. I go in an Aldo. They had like super like cool style of shoes. I went in recently. Everything is fake leather. It's like plastic and the designs are really bad in terms of quality, in terms of construction. It is a cheap shoe. Cheap shoes look cheap, which is the last shoe that you should avoid if you're an adult man. And that is anything that's fake leather or not leather. Because honestly, not leather fake leather shoes look like fake leather and they look cheap. They also aren't going to last you long. But now that I'm vegan, I know you are because you've already told me that 27 times because every vegan tells you they're vegan. Even if you're vegan, I would basically make an exception for your footwear because the reality is this quality footwear, it lasts you longer quality footwear works with a lot of different outputs. It also is going to be more comfortable. It's going to be more breathable. It's going to be more durable. It's going to last you longer. And if you go with a shoe that's not like over the top in terms of a real ornate design or color that's more subdued, that's a little bit more classic and style and shape, it's going to last you for years. Gentlemen, bottom line is this even the best of us need to purge our wardrobe from time to time. Do you see that? Do you see that? Your boy still got it gentlemen and hopefully you don't have any of the shoes we went over in today's video. If you dug this video, drop it like a tie."

        "transcript": " So I probably shouldn't do this video today and I may delete it tomorrow, but I just want to talk a little bit today about religion, God, spirituality, because I've never actually addressed it. And the reason is because you should never talk about these things, right? Well, today I want to because it just feels right. And the new direction of this channel is for me just to help people or talk about things that I think are important. And this topic, I would say in terms of importance, is up there. So here's the deal, I got to I got to I guess issue a few disclaimers before I get into this. If you are super devout or you are very religious and you have and hold strong ideology, you're probably not going to like this video. And I appreciate that. And I just want you to know that I am jealous, honestly, that you do have such strong beliefs. Because I feel like it would be a lot easier because for me, I have struggled with these things in the topic that I want to talk about today. And so I also just need you to understand that I don't know anything. I'm an idiot. That's basically the bottom line. I am an idiot. And I don't know much about many things. But I am going to share my opinion and some conclusions that I've come to over many, many years of thinking about kind of what comes next and the whole concept around religion and God. I need to start basically from the beginning where it started, right? I am Italian. My family is super Catholic. My grandmother like literally is the most Catholic woman you've ever met. Every time she was sitting there at night watching TV or wrestling, she'd be doing her rosaries, right? Every single morning at 530 AM, she would go to church. I mean, this woman was super freaking Catholic. My whole family was, but my mom didn't really want to instill that upon me because she has a lot of questions or she had a lot of questions and she wanted me to form my own opinion. And so I never did the whole Sunday school Catholic thing, but I was around it. My dad is a Buddhist. My father, my parents are divorced. My father, Peter, big papa A is a Buddhist. The whole Nam-yoh-ho-reng-ge-kyo, that whole thing. And he has been a Buddhist ever since I was basically like 10 years old. And so I was around that and exposed to that. All right, fast forward. My best friend, Jewish, I was exposed to that. My best friend in college, his father was a Lutheran minister. I was exposed to that. Then I moved to Georgia, the Bible Belt. I started dating a woman. She was a Baptist. I was exposed to that. Then I started going to a non-denominational Christian black church. I literally was the only white dude in the congregation. I did that for about two years. The music was amazing and the spirit was in the building, but it wasn't in me. And I felt super awkward every time. Everybody would get up and dance, but I did that. I've got a ton of friends that are Mormon. I've got a ton of friends that are Muslim. And this has led me to basically ask a lot of questions. So much so that for a period of about eight months, I went deep down the rabbit hole of world religions and I studied it. I wanted to know, like, okay, what does all of these different religions have in common and why are certain religions so against other religions? And why is it that if you're not this religion, then you're going to hell and is there hell and is there heaven and what does it look like? And so I've done my research, but the one thing I can say is that religion, they call it faith because faith is basically believing in something with the absence of proof. It just means that you believe it. And for me, like, I want to just believe, but unfortunately, when you see a lot of suffering or when you have friends that pass away or you see babies with cancer, the whole, like, God has a plan, goes out the window, at least it does for me. The other thing that went out the window is my ex-girlfriend who is Baptist. I remember her trying to tell me that if you're gay, you're going to hell. And I'm like, no, like, this just isn't reality. And she's like, yes, it is because the Bible says so. Like, that's like insane. Like, no, I don't care. If that's what it says, then it's wrong, which led me to start to read the Bible cover to cover both the Old and the New Testament. And then she would say things like, well, if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savener, then you are going to hell. I'm like, well, what about all these people and like these little tribes that never were exposed to Christianity? They're going to hell. She's like, yep, they had the choice. I'm like, no. And what about all the Buddhists, all the Asians? They're going out? Yep. What? This is crazy. And so when I started to really dive deep into religion and just understand and try to learn about these different things, it actually was, it's like this piece came over me because I realized all religions out there basically are saying the same thing. They've got different words for different things, whether or not it's God or Allah or enlightenment or reincarnation or heaven or hell like they are different words for the same thing. Everybody is basically preaching the exact same thing. Be a good person. Do the best job you can. Live a moral and righteous life. And if there is some place that we go after this life, then you're going to be there. Treat people well and with kindness and with courtesy and help people, help people. It's not that complicated. But one of the things that frustrates me is the idea that there's this supreme being that is picking winners and losers. You're blessed. You're not blessed. You're within my favor and you're going to get things because you believe in me, but you're not. I don't believe that. I feel like life, we've got more control over our destiny and what happens than anything. We control our destiny. We control our faith, our future. And if you're a good person and there's some place that we go after this life, then I feel like you're going to go there. And so for me, that's what I try to do. I wouldn't say I'm religious. I would say it's more of a spiritual. Do I believe that there's a God? Yeah, I do because I like the idea of it. I don't have like proof. But when I go for a hike in the woods, when I see something beautiful, it feels like that's God speaking to me and telling me that, Hey, I'm here because of this incredible beauty and I see acts of kindness. And with this recent, the floods here in Georgia and Florida and North and South Carolina, I see the spirit of humans and it's, it's beautiful. And if that's God, then maybe it is. But I've struggled with it. I wish I could just blindly accept something or what people say is right or wrong. But you know, when you think about it, if it was that black and white in terms of the Bible, why would there be a bunch of different religions? It doesn't make sense or add up. A religion is such a hard thing to discuss. And really it's because there are so many different ones. And when you're kind of one of those people that is a little bit more cerebral and you really start to question and think about things and look at things and what is being said and what is being taught and what you are told to believe. And you start questioning this. A lot of times people are not okay with that. And it's a shame, right? I wish I could have conversations with more people just about life and about, you know, this whole universe thing and the fact that, you know, I believe in UFOs. I believe that we are a small, small, small little dot in the universe, right? I don't believe like we're here alone. I just don't. It doesn't make sense to me. It just doesn't. So now it doesn't make sense is people hating you just because you believe something different than they do. As I've gotten older and I've experienced more, I've experienced more people, I've experienced more religions, I've experienced and learned more just in general about life and the more people that I lose and the more suffering I see, the more I question things. And this questioning has led me to basically a conclusion. So what do I believe? I believe that most religions are all saying the same thing. They've just got different words for different things and it boils down to this, be a good person and help people. That's it. Like that's pretty much it. In a nutshell, that's the secret. For me, I'm not saying I'm right. I hope I am, but I don't know. The longer I live, the more I see, the more suffering, the more the more beauty, the more everything. It all comes back to that for me. It's be a good person. And if you're a good person, you don't have to worry. I'm not scared to die. I don't want to. I don't want to die right now, but I feel like I've done the best job I can. And if there's a place for good people to go after you're done with this world, then I like to think that I'll be there with my family and my friends and my loved ones that have passed and my dogs and cats. But I don't know. Someday I probably will, but I just wanted to talk about it today. This is the new Alpha M channel. I'm talking about things that I want to talk about. I'm talking about things that have been on my heart and on my mind and that whether or not it's something that you agree with or not agree with, I just wanted to have a conversation and tell you my perspective, because I have a feeling that there's more than one of you out there that this video spoke to, and this may help you basically, or I should say, give you permission to think outside of the box and not just believe what you've been taught. But if you do believe what you've been taught, that's cool too. I love you. And like I said, be a good person and help people. Other than that, you're good."

        "transcript": " So apparently whoever said money can't buy happiness didn't build their dream gym in their basement. Gentlemen, follow me. Gentlemen, welcome to the new Alpha M home gym. This gym is so badass, so perfect, so Alpha 1000 square feet of unadulterated muscle building, body blasting, amazingness. Gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about all the pieces that I've got. Bottom line is this, it costs me in total around $60,000 for everything from the rubberized flooring, same stuff you're gonna find in a fitness center to my stair master. What? I've always wanted a stair master and I got one, the real one. Gentlemen, this is an absolute dream. But today I just wanna basically give you a little bit of a tour of the new gym, show you the pieces that I got. This is a dream. And it's almost like a little knuckle bump to the little 12 year old dude that started working out in his basement. Because working out has been the single best decision I've ever made in my life, starting to work out at 12 years old. From this point, everything in my life basically revolved around fitness. It was my constant. Fitness and working out has been the one consistent thing in my life that has allowed me and helped me get past the adversity. It's helped me basically feel confident about myself. And so when I knew that I was building this house, I was like, yo, I'm building the most badass gym ever. And I feel like I did. And I am just, I'm just super proud of this accomplishment and I'm proud of this gym, honestly. More so than the house, this gym really is my thing. And so anyway, I just wanna show you around, give you a little tour. All right, so like I said, this space is a thousand square feet. All right, you enter through these cool, badass iron doors. And then first thing when you walk in, you've got the Peloton bike, all right? We bought this, we were on vacation, it was an impulse buy. We used it probably about like seven times, but this is something we bought during COVID, but we brought it over to the new place. We're not sure where that's gonna live. It doesn't really feel that good right there, but everything else is perfect, all right? The thing that you're gonna notice, all matte black and sexy, exactly. And then this bad boy, the beast, the Stairmaster. All right, so when I was shopping for this equipment, I was like, I'm gonna get a treadmill, but I would really love a Stairmaster, because Stairmasters are the most ass-kicking workout ever in terms of cardio. I love it, but I hate it, but I love it. And so I ended up buying one of these bad boys. They had a little version, but then when I measured the height in here and I measured the unit, I was like, hey, I can actually fit this. And so I bought this. I also bought a super badass treadmill, all right? Now this treadmill is a commercial treadmill. There's a huge difference when it comes to commercial fitness equipment and home gym and home fitness equipment. The stuff you're gonna buy, like a Dick's Sporting Goods store or Walmart, the quality is pretty shitty, it's pretty cheap. All right, I am a snob when it comes to workout equipment. So all this stuff in here is actually commercial grade. It's more expensive, usually about double or triple the price, but in my opinion, it's worth it. It's solid, it lasts a long time. And for me, land ice treadmills, they are the best. This bad boy is a special treadmill. I love it, it's amazing, all right? And then, check it out. Boom, instead of messing around with change and weights all the time, because that's annoying. And if it's my dream gym, I'm definitely not doing that. And so what did I do? I bought this rack. All right, preset barbells, 110 pounds, all the way down to 20. And then I also, of course, have the rack of dumbbells, all right? From five down to 75 pounds. Now some of you are like, yo, Alphie, only 75 pounds, you're a puss. Yes, I'm a puss, I'm also almost 50. And then, boom, gorilla, yes. It's my kettlebell that my buddy Tony got me. It's cool. I don't know that I'll ever use it. Anyway, all right, this bad boy, leg press, all right? So one of the problems with my old gym is that I had a Smith machine, which was great. But I wanted some more proper leg equipment because that's one of the hard things. You can do bench, you can do dips, you can do all these things for like shoulders, biceps, but legs, that's one of the things that is really hard to do without the proper equipment. You can do all the walking lunges in the world. But all right, a great leg press, I absolutely love. And so this is from boys, it's sexy, it's matte black, super high quality. I need to get some more weight, but I ordered it, it's gonna be here in a little bit. All right, this bad boy is kind of like the centerpiece of the gym, all right? It's this really cool hoist functional trainer. These arms move all around, it's got double stack weights, you can drop it down, you can throw it up, you can do pull downs with it if you wanted to, you can do bicep curls, flies, all sorts of incredible exercises, including like rear delts, and then boom, an auxiliary bench, you can move it around for doing bench press or incline or seated, whatever. So all right, and then this, this is another piece that I've really, really wanted, which is the power rack, all right? You've got different adjustments, you've got weights on the side, you've got pull ups up top, you can do squats, you can do curls, you can do bench press, you can do so many different things with this one piece of equipment. Boom, yeah, you like that, little bench, you can move that wherever, and then this bad boy, which I absolutely freaking love, all right? This bad boy, this was a special piece, all right? It's got dips, because dips in my opinion are one of, if not the best, chest exercise out there, one of the best chest exercise out there. It's also got a little place that you can basically hop up, and you do your abs, I love that, and then up top, you've got pull ups. You even have these like, kinda cool, like little, like rock climbing grips, which I probably will literally never use, but it's cool, and it's sexy, and it's super sturdy, and that's the thing about this gym, everything is commercial. The next piece, right here, this bad boy, is a hamstring curl, leg extension combo. All you do is basically change, one or two adjustments, it's super smooth, and it's also incredible in terms of the flow and the feel of this exercise and this machine. All the equipment here is from the company Hoist, with the exception of the Power Rack, the Treadmill, and the Stairmaster, but everything else is Hoist, the dumbbells and the barbells are a company called TAG, and it's all crazy high quality. Now, I know what you're thinking, you're like, alpha, I thought you were building your dream gym, if it was my dream gym, I'd have a sauna, oh really? Boom, sauna, gentlemen, check this bitch out. Sauna, yes, all right, I was like, yo, I want a sauna, because A, I love saunas, and B, I've got this really cool auxiliary closet, lots of room in here, and it was just this weird little nook underneath one of my bay windows upstairs, that I was like, hey, I could probably fit a sauna in there, and we did, this thing is amazing, it's the Finlio, that's the brand, it's a real sauna, it's not that infrared nonsense, it actually gets hot up to about 200 degrees, I wish it was a little bit bigger, if I ever upgrade, maybe I'll sell this, because I do have a little room on either side, all right, I would like it a little bit bigger so that I could actually lay down, but whatever. That's the worst thing, all right, that's definitely first world problems, but I think someday I might get a bigger sauna, but this little room is pretty awesome, I'm gonna finish setting it up, and it's gonna be perfect, all right, gentlemen, speaking of perfect, what do you think? What would you add? What is a piece of equipment that I don't have that you would definitely need in your epic home gym? Down below, let me know, guys, thank you so much for coming along for the ride, I'm really proud of this gym, it is absolutely everything that I've ever dreamed of, and honestly, if the 12 year old little Alp could see me now, he probably wouldn't believe it."

        "transcript": " What's up gentlemen, today a little denim wear and tutorial. I'm showing you how to properly elevate the aesthetic by dressing up your favorite jeans. So as you know, all jeans were not created equal. They come in different colors, different fits, different fabrics. But the ones that you should definitely stay away from in terms of dressing up, overly distressed denim. This is impossible to dress up. Overly loose or baggy jeans also don't look great dressed up. Another one that you should avoid is raw or salvaged denim. It's too rigid of a fabric in order to actually look proper when you're dressing it up and looking smooth and sexy. Casual jeans are amazing with sneakers or with boots or more casual footwear, but you should never try to actually elevate the aesthetic. All right, now, jeans that you can dress up right here. The simple dark wash, non-distressed jean, in my opinion, is the dressiest of jean options. Gray jeans also look amazing when dressed up as long as the fit is right and there isn't a bunch of whiskering or distressing. All right, another great option. All right, a little bit more casual. All right, the indigo color is a little bit softer, a little bit more playful, but you can also dress this up because the color is consistent and you don't have a lot of distressing. White jeans, yes, please, absolutely can be dressed up in the summertime. Spring and summer, you can rock the white denim. Winter, fall, you should avoid these. If you want to combine it with a crisp white polo or a white button-up shirt, maybe a navy blazer, some loafers or some cool minimal sneaks, gentlemen, absolutely able to dress up white. And another pair is black. Black denim also can be dressed up. You just got to make sure you dress it up properly. In terms of denim fit, guys, that can be dressed up, you want to go with something that is a slim fit or a straight fit. You don't want it to be too big a bag. You also don't want it to be skin tight. You want to make sure that the length is the proper length for you, all right? Which means there's not a lot of bunching or puddling down by the ankle. You want to make sure that jean fits you perfectly. And your booty better be bangin', gentlemen, no sagging pants. It is literally impossible to dress up sagging pants. Get them up. The jeans need to fit you perfectly, all right? Not too tight, not too big, not too long, just right. Now, once you got the right jeans, gentlemen, now it's all about picking out the other pieces, which isn't that complicated. Check it out, guys. Simple, quick, easy way to dress up denim in a casual setting, right? You got sneaks, you got denim, you got t-shirt, and I threw on a suede bomber. Any type of suede jacket, in my opinion, is a great way to instantly elevate the level of dress with your denim. Second option is to throw on some nice jacket or outerwear, right? Whether or not it's a top coat, a driving jacket, or some type of pea coat, it's a great way to elevate the aesthetic of jeans, all right? Even a navy pea coat, like, instantly dresses up the jeans. And the whole idea is that if you're wearing a little bit more of a casual look, all right, by throwing on a nicer jacket, it instantly elevates the aesthetic, but still keeps the casual cool. A field jacket is also another great option, and it's a quickly and simply elevate the aesthetic. But the field jacket is going to be a little bit more casual. Now, what I would not do with an outfit like this, right, and we're going jeans, sneakers, t-shirt, is throw on a sport coat, all right? A sport coat or a suit jacket looks really bad, in my opinion, when you actually wear it with jeans and sneakers. Now, I'm going to show you some outfits that it actually looks great, but this isn't it. The cardigan sweater also is another great outerwear option to instantly elevate the aesthetic with sneakers, denim, and a simple t-shirt. Now, let's take it next level. So check it out, right? Brown Lopers, denim, medium wash, white polo. This polo came from Collars & Co. Guys, I'm going to link to Collars & Co. down below. They are today's video sponsor. I'll tell you a little bit more about them in a second, but their polos are perfect. This is actually the casual polo that they sell, but it's still not like super casual. It's extra sexy. The collar, check it out. A little cutaway collar, right? It doesn't get all crazier whack. The sleeves are perfect. This is actually one of their cotton polos that I've absolutely fallen in love with. The fit is amazing, guys. There's a link. There's a code down below. If you haven't checked out Collars & Co., now is the time. Anyway, I combined it with a great pair of jeans through on my brown loafers. Guys, brown loafers are a must-have if you're trying to dress up jeans. I've got some black shoe outfits a little bit later, but in my opinion, brown works a lot better with denim than black does. Now, I've got some black sexy outfits a little bit later that I'll show you, but, all right, in my opinion, brown is a must-have. Anyway, boom, check it out. I threw on a simple lightweight cardigan over top of the polo. With the jeans, with the loafers, absolute perfection. Laser sport coat time, gentlemen. This is where so many guys mess it up. A lot of guys like the look, but they don't know how to do it properly. I'm going to show you how to do it, right? So bottom line, if you are going to be wearing a blazer or a sport coat with your jeans, guys, you got to make sure you're doing it right. Here's how you do it right. Nice pair of loafers or shoes. You could go brogues. It's really up to you. The white polo and then the jeans and a navy blazer, right? You could go navy. You could go some type of pattern. Do not wear your suit jacket with jeans. I'm just going to throw it out there because a lot of guys think, oh, I'll just wear it with jeans. Do not do that. And the reason is because it looks like a suit jacket. All right, you want a blazer. You want something that's going to be a little bit less constructed and more casual in nature. All right, this is the perfect blazer. It's actually called the Maverick Blazer. It's also from Collars and Co. I'll link to it down below. This is, in my opinion, perfection because the fabric is super stretchy. And the thing that you're going to be like, yo, what? Seriously, you can wad this thing up, right? You can stick it in your backpack. You pull it out and it's good as new. It literally has this like crazy technology built into the fabric, which makes it super comfortable, super stretchy, and super freaking perfect in terms of travel. Or just having with you, it's just the perfect jacket for most guys because literally you can throw it on with jeans and it looks amazing. You can dress it up with a pair of slacks or even some type of Chino and it looks incredible. Guys, if you've even been to Collars and Co, I would highly recommend hitting that link down below. They've got a lot more than just perfect polos. That's how they got their start. All right, if you guys are familiar with Shark Tank, which I definitely am, that's how I first heard about Collars and Co. All right, they were on, they were pitching, and Mark Cuban invested like a million dollars because he knew that this company solved the problem that so many guys face. And that is having a polo that you could actually properly dress up. Check it out. Button down collar. It's also from Collars and Co. And I combined it with black jeans and black shoes, right? Black loafers. Simple, clean, actually not simple, sexy, sexy, clean, amazing. Now, a little bit next level, you throw on a camel color jacket or some cool badass jacket on top, pop the collar, gentlemen. Come on, come on. Guys, hit the link down below. Go check out Collars and Co. If you go through my link, you're going to get a discount. They've got more than just polos, more than just blazers. They've got sweaters. They've got outerwear.

Guys, hit the link down below. Collars and Co. makes amazing clothes and you are going to look sexy. Sweaters, gentlemen. We got to talk about sweaters because certain sweaters can elevate the aesthetic of jeans as long as you combine them properly with the right shoes or boots, right? So for this outfit, went back to my medium wash denim, combined it with a cable knit turtleneck, gentlemen. And then I threw on a pair of black Chelsea boots. Guys, Chelsea boots, the thing that I love so much about them, if they're a dressier Chelsea, they look amazing when combined with denim and instantly elevate the aesthetic. And so if you're thinking, oh, I want to wear boots with my jeans, that's great. Because boots and jeans go together like alpha, M and screaming. They just work because of course you think, oh, if I'm going to wear jeans in the winter or fall, I'm going to rock boots. All right, a few boots that look amazing, right? You've got your Chuckas, Suede Chuckas. Boom, sexy as hell. Suede Chuckas are amazing for dressing up jeans. They're still a casual boot though. The shinier leather is going to basically dress up those jeans a little bit more. The more matte finish of that leather in terms of a boot, it's going to make it and the entire outfit look more casual, right? But this outfit I absolutely love. I feel like a cool hip sexy, actually nothing, I just feel sexy. Black Chelsea boots, medium wash jeans, and the cable knit turtleneck. The V-next sweater also an amazing option to instantly elevate the aesthetic of a pair of denim, right? Combine it with some pair of nice shoes or some badass sexy Chelsea boots. And you are killing it. If pumpkin spice latte had an outfit, it would be this outfit because it's warm, sexy, perfect for fall and expensive, right? Here's the deal. The outfit, amazing. Chelsea boots went with Suede because Suede adds a richness, texture, and elevation to denim. And then boom, the sweater, you like that? The fall color, the green sexiness gentleman. This is from Collars and Code. Yeah, I told you, don't wait, hit the link. Comes in a bunch of colors. Reno wool, long sleeve polo, also a devastatingly perfect option for dressing up with jeans. Now, I could go loafers, I could go boots, but instead for this outfit, I saw these and I'm like, oh, they're awesome, all right? They're Suede sneaker, right? With the brown sole, so it really works well with this rich, sexy outfit. Now, the last thing I want to talk about is wearing a sport coat with jeans and a button-up shirt, all right? So this is a classic look. Now, in terms of making sure that you look amazing, I would always go with the classic solid white shirt or black shirt or navy shirt, something solid in color. The patterns are a little bit tricky if you're going to be combining it with some type of patterned jacket. Now, in terms of jackets, you could go with something solid, which makes matching super easy and you look amazing, or you could go with some type of rich, heavy texture. Sport coats with interesting patterns or textures or colors are amazing when combined with the simple, white shirt, button-up shirt, jeans, and a great pair of loafers. Now, if you're going to be wearing some type of fun sport coat, I would definitely stay away from wearing like sneakers. I would definitely go with loafers or some type of dressy, Chelsea boots. Gentlemen, that's it. The fact is denim is amazing. Every guy needs it. Now, you're going to know how to actually dress it up properly as opposed to your weird uncle Barry, who doesn't do it well. But my mom says I look handsome."

        "transcript": " So today I'm going to tell you a story that I've literally never shared with anybody. Never said it out loud because I've always been too embarrassed to actually admit it, but I feel like it's important for me to share with you something that happened to me back when I was 21 years old because it's really, there's a few reasons. Number one, it's the worst case scenario. I think it's what we all fear when we start to have insecurity about a relationship, but the reason why I really want to share this with you is because it's possible to get over it. And really that is what this video is about. I want to share with you some of the tools and tips that I have used personally in order to not allow relationship and security to rule my relationships and ruin my life because when you're insecure about a relationship or you're worried that somebody's doing something they shouldn't be doing, it literally is all consuming. And if you don't have the tools in order to get it in check, it can potentially ruin an amazing relationship. And personally, I don't want that to happen to me. I also don't want it to happen to you. So I'm going to try and give you the condensed version of this. I always talk about you shouldn't snoop. Don't look if you don't trust the person, you've got to figure out why or get out of the relationship. But once you breach that trust or once you look, it's like opening the Pandora's box. You also, a lot of times can find things that unfortunately you can't unsee and you wish maybe you didn't know, but once you know, you know, and there's no going back. In college, I was dating a girl and I read her journal. She was a big journaler and I was having all sorts of insecurity. I was feeling like she might be doing something because our relationship was off. I wasn't feeling it. She went to work and you know what happened. I grabbed it and I started reading. And once I started reading, I couldn't stop reading. And unfortunately, not only did I find out that she was hooking up or she hooked up with other people other than her ex-boyfriend that I knew about, but I still took her back because of some issues with me, which we'll talk about in a second. I also read some things that she said about me that weren't super great in terms of she just wasn't that attracted to me. How do you unsee that? How do you deal with it? What do you do? Well, I'll tell you what I did. I shut the journal and I tried to make it look like I never opened it and I waited for her to come home. And then basically I just pestered her and bugged her for days and then it turned into weeks until I finally got her to admit that she hooked up with these other people and that she truly wasn't attracted to me. And the worst part, I dated her for another two years after that. Every day I was worried about her doing something she showed me doing. Every day I was worried about how she felt about me and every single day I felt terrible about myself. But the interesting thing, I never opened that journal ever again. And the reason is pretty simple because I didn't want to know what she said or what she did because it was too painful. And so instead I decided to just basically I basically decided one day that I deserve better and that I was tired of living this life with this person. And so I basically said, look, this isn't it. We got to go. We got to end this. And I've got to work on me. And I did. And so what I'd like to share with you now guys is some tips and some strategies in order to get over relationship insecurity because the good news is that if I can do it after having that situation happen to me, you can do it too. But it starts with you wanting to be better. So step number one is figuring out why you are insecure and jealous. What is it? All right. Is it something that happened you a long time ago? Is it a past relationship? Is it some insecurity that you feel deep down? Is it because you don't feel you have enough money? You don't have anything to offer. You got a little wiener. You've got like whatever you've got to try to identify why you're feeling that way. Now for a lot of people it's difficult. It's difficult to pinpoint or put your finger on it. That is one of the other reasons why I go into therapy. In my opinion is such an amazing tool. Therapy was the tool that I use to deal with my issues and to get over a lot of this shit. The reality is that it's not going to just go away and it's always going to be there but you don't have to be a victim of your circumstances or your past failures or the past situation. It takes you taking control and that is what a therapist helped me realize that I'm awesome. Seriously, my therapist helped me realize that I'm fucking awesome and I deserve the best and this is how I'm going to go get it. Guys, therapy, amazing gift, better help, amazing resource. There's a link down below. They are today's video sponsor. Better help is on a mission to make starting therapy easy, affordable, convenient, and comfortable. That's the thing I love so much about Better Help and it's super simple to get started. All you do, you hit that link down below and you fill out the questionnaire. The questionnaire is awesome. It's designed to basically help match you with a therapist that's going to be best suited for you, your needs, and what you're actually dealing with. Then on most cases you're going to be able to start communicating within a couple of days. Now, the one thing you need to understand is that therapy is also a lot like dating. Sometimes you meet somebody and bang, it's magic, right? You connect with them very well, but sometimes you might need to try a few different ones in order to really connect. Well, with Better Help, you get to actually change or switch therapists for free until you find that perfect person.

Go to betterhelp.com slash alpha m. That's B E T T E R H E L P dot com slash alpha m to get 10% off your first month of therapy. Guys, the deal is this, it's time for you to do the work. Do not allow past relationships or your insecurity with yourself to basically sabotage a potential amazing relationship because the reality is that a lot of times this insecurity and this jealousy is your problem. It's not them, it's you. It doesn't mean not to trust your gut, but sometimes your gut will lie to you and we end up believing it. Guys, get some perspective. Better Help, the link down below, click it. You're going to get 10% off your first month of therapy. Step number one is try to identify why you're feeling the way that you are. Did something happen that's justifying why you're feeling the way that you are or is it something that you've just kind of conjured up in your head and you now are convincing yourself that that thing that you thought is actually real because unfortunately I am really good at basically believing my own lies or making something out of nothing. You've got to try to not do that. I know it's hard. I know it's easier said than done, but one of the things you can do is stop trying to read the other person's mind. You've got to ask them. If there's something that is bothering you, whether or not you're feeling insecure about a guy or a coworker of theirs or that you don't have enough money or whatever it is, ask them. Ask them about it and hopefully you guys have a good, healthy relationship and you guys can actually communicate and work through the issue, but do not continue to pester her. If you ask and she tells you, don't keep trying to say, hey, well, what about this or are you sure? Do you really mean it? But what about no, you're trying to get a different answer. You got to stop doing that. Step number three is stop confusing imagination with reality, which is once again, something that happens a lot when you're feeling insecure. You start to build things up in your head. You start to imagine certain things or read into things. And this can unfortunately lead to a lot of bad behavior like snooping. All right? Snooping, in my opinion, is never acceptable. And I say that as somebody who did it, but I've never done it with anybody else I dated other than that one person. And the reason is because that one time was so painful. The other reason is that I don't need to the relationships that I'm in now, I feel comfortable. And when there's an issue, I ask, I also trust the person. The other thing that I did was not bring my past relationship forward into my new relationship, which is the next step. If something happened to you, all right, and this is me just talking here. If something happened that was shitty, somebody cheated on you just because somebody else cheated on you and the past doesn't mean that the next person will. You've got to understand that. But one of the things that will ruin a relationship is you pestering them or making up things in your head and accusing them of things that aren't actually going on or starting to go down the rabbit hole of snooping, whether or not it's their cell phone, their Instagram account, their social media. Once you start going down the snooping rabbit hole, it's literally a very, very slippery slope. And unfortunately, when you start snooping, when you start looking, a lot of times you can find things and read into them that may or may not actually be there. The other unfortunate reality is that if you start snooping and this person finds out, this is a breach of trust. It's also a breach of confidence. And once you lose that trust in somebody, whether or not they cheated or they're snooping, it's very, very difficult to come back from. You've got to be committed to come back from it. You've got to be committed to not do it again. But if you relapse and you snoop just because you just want to make sure this is not good, it's also going to be very difficult to ever have a happy, healthy relationship because healthy relationships don't snoop. They don't check up on people. They don't go and stalk them in their car like I did. I did that too. Something else that I'm incredibly embarrassed about. Trust your gut, but don't allow your gut to rule your emotions or make bad decisions for you. If there's something that just doesn't feel right, a lot of times something's not right. Ask about it. Follow up with them, but do not pester them and do not build something up or make things up in your brain or in your head. It's one of the things that will absolutely sabotage your relationship. And if you have an issue and something happens and you decide to fix it and to continue with your relationship, do not bring it up again. The reason I'm saying that is because one of the issues that happens is a lot of times when there's an issue, whether or not it's a man, a woman doing something they shouldn't have been doing, or talking to somebody or flirting or whatever, and you get over it or you say you get over it, if you start fighting again and bringing it up, that's unacceptable. It's dirty fighting. Once you've put something to bed and decide that that's over, you've got to allow it to be over, because if you keep bringing it up, this is incredibly toxic. It also is never going to allow your relationship to heal, which means if you aren't getting over it, you have not healed. If you don't think that you're able to heal, then you've got to end the relationship because it will never get better. Give your relationship room to breathe. That is the next tip and step I would like to give you. You cannot micromanage somebody into not cheating or not wanting to leave you. You can't do it. In order to have anything grow, you've got to allow it to breathe and your relationship is no different. You've got to allow this person to have their own friends, to go do their thing, for you to have your own, for you not to be so consumed with what they're possibly doing. You can't worry about that because it will literally eat you alive. The next thing I just want to mention and the thing that truly will get you over your feelings of insecurity and inadequacy is work on you. Make you the priority. Unfortunately, when we get into relationships, a lot of times we can become obsessive or we can really focus too much on the relationship or on that person, as opposed to ourselves. A lot of times we lose our identity. A lot of our hobbies that we used to have, we stopped doing. Maybe we stopped going to the gym. Maybe we stopped doing all the things that we did in order to get this person and that in and of itself stifles our growth as an individual and it also makes us feel bad about ourselves. When you feel bad about yourself, that is once again when a lot of these feelings of insecurities will manifest and seep into your brain. You've got to start doing a better job of taking care of you. Make you the priority. It doesn't mean you can't have a relationship, but you've got to be the focus. You can't neglect you for somebody else and no amount of love, no amount of smothering is going to prevent somebody from doing something if they are a broken person and that is kind of the last thing I'd just like to leave you with. If somebody is going to cheat on you or not be honest or upfront or leave you when they don't want to be with you anymore, that's a problem with them. Shame on them. No amount of love, no amount of caring, no amount of affection can fix a cheater, but also on the flip side, no amount of attention and love can prevent somebody from doing it if that is what they are pre-designed or hardwired to do. Some people have issues that they have not dealt with. They've got to do the deep work and until they do, they're going to seek this outside attention or approval from other people and it's never going to be enough. They're constantly going to be seeking, they're constantly going to be looking for attention and affection from some outside source. You are awesome, period. If somebody doesn't want to be with you, fine, let them go. You will find the person you are supposed to be with and when you do and when it is a happy, healthy, beautiful relationship, you're not going to have the need and the urge to snoop. You're not going to have the urge, the need to follow up or to worry about them all the time because both people are reassuring each person enough and you trust them. When you trust somebody, you don't feel the insecurity and you're not super jealous, period, because you know that it's healthy. You know that it's happy and you know that you're awesome. Guys, you are amazing. She's the lucky one. I just need to get it out of the way. She is. So stop being so weird and insecure. Do the work you need to do in order to feel better about yourself. Figure out why you're feeling that way and then fix it. If it's because of money issues, make more money. If it's because of body issues, get a better body, but do not allow these insecurities that you have with you to impact your relationship and make her pay for your inability to do the deep work. Guys, it's time for you to straighten up and do the work. Do the work. I promise it's worth it."

        "transcript": " Brain rot is causing your brain to turn into mush and it will destroy your 20s and 7 very specific ways. But first, let's just see just how rotten your brain is. How far have you fallen into brain rot by taking the brain rot quiz. Now we're gonna take this together. I haven't seen this yet. Ha! Let's go. Let's start easy mode. Fill in the blank. Urm what the... Sigma. Okay, that one's easy. Urm what the Sigma, bro. Come on. I'm a little ashamed I know that. Alright, let's go number two. Second one. What song played at the TikTokers part? Carnival. I should have known this, bro. Carnival. I'm a Kanye fan, bro. I'm sorry. Let's keep going. Third one. What is it called when someone is giving extreme compliments to you? Glazing. They're glazing you, bro. They're glazing you, bro. Too many compliments. Alright, that was easy level. If you got him all right like I did, I wouldn't be too worried. But now we're going into medium level. If you start getting these right, your brain is turning into mush. Who has the greatest Riz of all time? Bro, the fact that I know this. The Rizler. Come on, bro. Everybody knows that. Next. What did Cotton Eye Joe do? Oh, thank God. I have no idea what that is. He prevented a man from being married. Yeah. I don't even know what the hell that is. Alright, next one. Which state has the most brain rot? It's Ohio, bro. Everything's bad in there. Everything sucks in Ohio. Yo, that's where the Palm Brothers are at. I wonder what they feel about this. Ohio. Oh, there you go. That was easy. Alright, look. If you got all of these right, I got two out of three at the medium level. You're on your way to having brain rot. I got an excuse, yo. I do social media for them. So I gotta be online all the time. But now we're going into hard level. If you know all of these, bro, this video is for you. What do you say to ice spice when she passes by? Oh, my God. I already know what it is. I know what it is. Come on. Let's move on to extreme level. This should have been moved upward, bro. Extreme. Which brain rot ruined Generation Alpha? Ah, yeah. Thank God I didn't know that. SkibbD toilet. Look, if you got all eight of these, you gotta stick around. Because your brain is actually getting rotten from all this content. Now, regardless of what score you got, you need to stick around for this video because you need to understand how this content is actually affecting your brain and how it could potentially destroy your 20th. Example number one, it's going to keep you alone forever. Content like this, this is the reason you're single. You have to understand that our brains evolved to live in small tribes of 25 to 50 people. Back then, the pool of women that you could actually date was tiny. Once you got rid of older women, children, and women that were already in relationships, they were only made in two to three options left. And as a result, your standards for what you thought a woman would be attractive for were way more realistic. Today, you're exposed to hundreds, thousands of women, many of whom are dancing provocatively. They're then wearing makeup to enhance their looks. Some have had plastic surgery to appear more attractive. Others strategically work out specific muscles that no will stimulate your senses as a man. Your brain has now been rewired through brain rot content to expect something unrealistic. The result is that you'll never be fully satisfied with that girl you're with. And you're always going to be comparing them to this impossible standard because you're always looking for something better. But this is just one of six ways that brain rot content will destroy your 20th because it's not just going to sabotage your relationships. It's going to sabotage your ability to make money, your ability to build a great body, and so much more. So you stopping in this video today is the best decision you ever made. Count to rack all the brain rot you're constantly watching. Number two, it'll make you a poor consumer instead of a rich creator. I'm about to go meet a friend. I'm going that way. You're going that way. So I've had a two-point-a-view. Bro, this type of brain rot content, bro, this is all you hear all day. This is what's keeping you as a poor consumer. But you can easily become a rich creator by doing exactly what they're doing. But you're going to do it better. And I'm going to show you how. First, I want you to pick something you love to do, some niche. It could be a sport, a hobby. It doesn't matter. If you don't know what niche to choose, according to Spotify, the top-paying ones right now are finance, technology, beauty, help. Once you've chosen your niche, I want you to start reaching out to brands in that space. Ask for free products in that you'll post a free review for that product. At the same time, I want you to also create an online community. Then you're going to post a video, like the one above, where you review the five items that you got for free. And make sure to use an affiliate link in the description. That way you can get commissioned for every sale that occurs. Here's where you're going to do it better. It doesn't even have to be you doing the content. You can create an AI version of either yourself or someone else to produce this content instead of having to use your own face and your own body. So not even your friends or family know you'll do it. Because a lot of times, this is what stops most of you from creating what others think of you. Bro, right now, there's creators like this dude from Barcelona who created an AI girl. And he's making $10,000 a month off of this AI influencer. But you're not going to finish there. At the end of the video, once you're done reviewing, you're going to include a call to action to drive people into your community, where in that community, you can charge a monthly subscription for. And inside, you can provide even more content and direct links to products that you're reviewing and build a paid membership there. Now, you're getting revenue sources from multiple directions and slowly you're transforming from being a consumer of content to a creator of content. From there, it's easy. Keep reaching out to brands, keep posting the content, and keep funneling people into your community. You can even give away all that free product you get. Give it away for free inside of your community as an incentive. And as your community grows, you're going to want to keep engaging with these members to keep them active, to keep them happy. Number three, it makes you think insane results come from hard work. Health, take in my health. Everybody saw this transformation. This transformation was insane. I feel like his head doesn't match his body anymore. I've never seen a guy look that shredded even in a span of a year. That's like, that's an insane transformation. And what happens is when you get filled with this type of content, you think this type of transformation comes from hard work. You see, when you get motivation like this in your feet, one of two things happens. It will either make you depressed because of how you look or it inspires you to do something. But then you don't even see the same results, so you end up depressed anyways. The reason this happens is because these so-called transformations are usually not natural. He is probably using one of the three most common performance boosters in the market right now. The first one is Ozenpeng. This drug makes you feel fuller for longer so you don't overeat. The problem is, it's not cheap or accessible for most people and it also comes with a ton of side effects. If you want something more natural and affordable, use Hawthorne berries instead. That's what we include in our Get Strong supplement. These are known to support digestion and heart health. This helps regulate your appetite naturally. They can also improve your body's metabolism. And yes, you can eat the natural stuff or if you're like me, probably just take it every single day. Take three capsules over Get Strong and you can get in your daily dose of Hawthorne berries. The second most common performance enhancing drug all of these guys are using is Anivar. This is one of the most commonly used and most famous anabolic steroid out there. Bodybuilders love it because it helps build muscle and speed up recovery. But also linked to liver damage, hormonal imbalances, and a ton of other side effects that honestly, I just don't think it's worth it. So instead of that, if you want a natural version, which again, it won't be as effective as a steroid, but it's natural and something you can take every day with minimal side effects, take Tribulus Terestis. This plant extract naturally boosts testosterone levels. It supports muscle growth and recovery minus all the side effects you don't want. If you pair it with magnesium for more energy production, now you got a legal and safe stack you can take every day and not experience anything crazy. Both of which are in a Get Strong supplement. Get Strong has nine vitamins and minerals like magnesium, Tribulus Terestis, and Hawthorne berries, all scientifically proven to help with testosterone, libido, and muscle production. That's why we call it Get Strong, bro. It's in the name. You buy it, you take three pills a day, and you're good to go. Now, the third one that most of these transformations use, it's something called Clean Lutero. This has insane thermogenic effects. In simple terms, it just boosts up your testosterone so you can burn fat faster than anything else in the market. But it also causes insane heart palpitation and anxiety and it scores a ton of other unhealthy side effects. A less intense and more suitable natural version is something called horny goatweed. I sorter you out and make this name up, bro. This is actually the name. You can look this stuff up. This helps increase blood flow, which as you increase blood flow, your body is using more calories so your metabolism increases as well. And yes, boys, I also included a horny goatweed and our Get Strong supplement. This thing is stacked for any guy that's actually looking to get strong to boost testosterone, to boost libido, to boost muscle production, or physical performance. Well, you need to take this and it's natural. So you know there's not going to be any crazy unhealthy side effects. If I were you, I would run. Click the link in the description. Subscribe so you can get it at the cheapest price possible and now you can be consistent and take this every day. Number four, it makes you think getting rich comes from hard work. Come on, bro. Those are just numbers on the screen. Nobody verifies this and the problem is that when you watch content like this, you're led to believe, oh, he must have gotten there by hard work. If I work hard, I'm going to do the same. This is not true because to actually build wealth, you need three things and no one ever tells you about that third thing. The first one is hard work. This part is true. And this is why these creators are able to hook you with their content. Hard work, it's relatable and it's something that we all understand. The second one is that you need to work smart. You need to have specific knowledge in whatever field to excel. But here's the third one, the one they'll never tell you you need luck. Take Bill Gates, for example. He worked hard and smart to build Microsoft, but his high school was one of the first ones to have a computer in 1973 because his parents were well off while personal computers weren't wildly available to the public till the 1990s. This gave Bill Gates a 17-year head start. Then you have Warren Buffett, the greatest investor of all time. He bought his first stock at 13 thanks to his financially literate father who taught him how to do it. Today, the average investor buys their first stock at age 33. Bro, that gives Buffett a 20-year head start. Now, this doesn't mean that these people don't work hard or don't work smart. They absolutely do. But when you watch brainwashed content like this, you compare your results versus their opportunities without realizing that they had access to resources and luck that you probably didn't. And that comparison will leave you like a failure and will destroy your motivation to actually keep pushing. But by this point, you already realize that brainwashed content will never leave you truly happy with your girlfriend, will keep you poor and will make you feel like a failure. And honestly, I wish I could tell you that's where it stops. This is all it's gonna do to you. But it only gets much worse the more you consume this content. Example number five, it makes you think women are the problem. So could you be with a guy that makes 100,000 a year? No. That's crazy, yo. I bet your own daddy doesn't make that type of money, bro. That's $274 a day. Okay, so dinner for two and if we add it, it'll be a $300 check. Bro, she has no idea how delusional she is. As a matter of fact, there's this thing called the delusion calculator. If we use this calculator and we set the parameters to any age, any race, any height, any marital status, the percentage of men that are earning at least 100,000 a year, only 16.4%. Now let's narrow that down, exclude married men, and let's narrow it to men between the ages of 18 and 40. Now the percentage of men that make that money, 3.9%. But here's the kicker, girls like that online will say that $100,000 isn't enough. And they also want a guy that's at least six feet tall. When you add that into the calculator, the percentage of men goes down to 0.78%. When you as a man see content like this, it's so easy to compare yourself and you start to feel inadequate, thinking you're never going to meet those unrealistic standards. But here's the truth. What studies show is that what women want is a man that is taller than them and also earns more than they do. Here in America, the average woman is around five feet four inches tall and they make an average income of around $42,000 a year. When you use that criteria on men, just being slightly taller than that and making slightly more than that, there are percentage of men that they would actually be interested in, drops to 52.7%. Meaning you're probably a stud and an eligible bachelor to any of these girls, but watching brain rot content like that is what makes you feel inadequate as if you're not good enough. Number six, brain rot content scientifically lowers your IQ. If you got something to say, head to my face. Do you catch that? That's insane. That can get you the president. This is weird. Now, in the video, it looks like Joe is praising Kamala, but he hasn't. In the actual podcast, if you watch it, he was actually praising Tozgy Gabber, who's on the Trump team. The point here is that brain rot content feeds you misinformation. And unless you go out and you search for the truth, you're going to believe it, which leads you to live in a false reality. Now, regardless of your political affiliation, this is wrong because the more you take in false information, you become more and more focused on just one specific way of thinking. Then the algorithms start to feed you more and more of the same specific misinformation, digging you deeper and deeper into that one way of thinking. It's a hole that's hard to escape. Number seven, it makes you hate working and studying. It has been said that the first person who will never die is now alive. That's actually interesting. So they get some new thing that makes you live an extra 50 years. So now you live to 150 instead of 100. And then somewhere in there, probably going to be my guy, Brian Johnson, out there trying not to die. So now the 150 goes to 350. Now you can live 500 years. Now you go to 1,000. Look, the information is great. My man, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is dropping gems, but you're not realizing what's happening. You're not actually paying attention. See, when it comes to information like this, because you can't focus, the editor had to put something underneath just to keep you locked in. See, our brains crave stimulation. It doesn't want to have to work for it. In the past, there wasn't any high stimulating video game or short form content that was readily available at your fingertips. When people wanted stimulation, they would reach over for a book or they would start working. Was it necessarily fun? No, but it stimulated the mind. Now with brain rock content at your fingertips, you're constantly putting more stimulating distractions between your mind and the work that you actually need to do. Making it harder and harder to focus on actually working and studying this brain rock content. It's getting more and more stimulating, numbing you more and more and keeping you away from your ultimate goals. And overall, you'll destroy your 20s if you don't put a stop to it. Now, the best way to do that is by becoming a creator and not a consumer of. See you boys next time."

        "transcript": " The key to becoming that student is making yourself actually enjoy school. So in today's video, I'm going to be reacting to some of the most viral videos online that teach your students not only how to look good, but how to perform well. Number one, learn how to pose for pictures. Stop posing like this. It's right. That looks bland, bro. Look, the dude's right. He's just posing all wrong. If you pose like that, you're going to get bullied, bro. This is how you should actually pose. You need to remember something called the rule of thirds. Imagine every picture you take being split up into three columns. You're going to always offset yourself into one of the columns and never be directly in the middle. So for example, let's take the first pose everybody does. Instead of standing directly in the middle, look awkward, just shift yourself slightly off-centered into that first column. We're not going to be checking a watch, but you could be checking your phone. If you're going to be checking your phone, stand in the third column. And again, it just makes the picture slightly more interesting. Now, this is important for you as a student because let's be real, half of your life is online. So if you could look better online, you're already on your way to being that student. But to be that student, it's more than just being attractive or looking good online. That student also gets good grades, gets to grow this dream, has a great body. To get all of those, you're going to need these six next tips I'm about to give you. Number two, use the blurting technique. Your teacher announces the highest and lowest grades on the last exam. Somehow you got the highest. Of course you did, bro. That student always gets the higher grade. So back in college, I tried this weird technique called blurting. I love this. The blurting technique is crazy simple, but it works. All you got to do is start by blurting out or essentially writing down everything you can remember about a certain topic. You got to do this without cheating or looking at your notes. By doing this, you force your brain to recall information which reinforces your memory. Next, you will check your notes and fill in anything that you missed. And then you will repeat the entire process two more times. By the third time, you will have cemented everything you need to know in both your short term and your long term memory, making it way easier to remember everything you need to remember on exam day. This is a straight up fact. You should 100% do it. Number three, three simple ways for any guy to be more attractive at school. Let's watch. The first tip is to wear more black outfits. It's probably the one shade that will make you look more attractive. 100%. This should every guy should do this. Wearing black, that only makes you look more mature, but it also has a slimming effect which makes your physique look better. However, don't just grab any random black shirt. You want to choose one that doesn't shrink after your first wash and actually enhances your muscular appearance. This is easier said than done. So rather than me just telling you, let me show you. To do this, I'm going to be testing five standard black tees from Zara, Uniclo, H&M, Haines, and Essentials. That's right boys. Essentials which is the best t-shirt in the world. We just restocked them. So you know I have to put them head to head. So we're going to do three tests on all of these. We're going to do the field test, the wash test, and the fit test. Now for this one, I brought in a random girl and I had her feel each one of the random shirts. She has no idea which shirts belongs to which brand. Her job is just to rank them purely on softness on how they feel. What do you think about this one? So this shirt's a little like softer, so I kind of like it a little bit more than the other one. Am I surprised? Absolutely not. Bro, Essentials uses bamboo cotton. Every other shirt uses cotton. That bamboo bro, it literally feels like silk on the skin which is why we've sold over 300,000 of the shirts. It's the best t-shirt in the world. The reason is because bamboo fabric is naturally rounded. The cotton bamboo also doesn't get treated with all those harsh chemicals that cotton gets treated with and that's what makes cotton very hard. So when you combine these two, that's why the fabric feels superior to any t-shirt you've ever felt. It's so good that bro, even a blind test girl can notice the difference. Imagine you wearing that shirt. By the way, they sell out insanely fast and they just restocked it if I were you on run, especially at the price that they're at now. But now let's move on to the second, which is the wash test. Put them in the washing machine and I ran them through the exact same cycle. You see, low-quality fabrics will get damaged and shrink when they're exposed to warm water. While other fabrics, they're going to be far more durable due to their natural elasticity. Now that the wash is done, let's throw them on and let's see which one of these shirts kept its natural softness and fit. Here's the problem. Most brands just go for a one-size-fits-all hoping to appeal to everybody, which is why some of these shirts just don't fit right in certain places, but with essentials because it was designed with the entire mentality of making the men's frame look better. You notice that it hugs the bicep right above the tricep, which makes your arms look bigger. It hugs the chest, which makes your chest look thicker. And then we leave it off over the midsection so it's comfortable to wear all day. Just wearing these side-by-side, you can see the immediate difference a good fitting shirt can do to you. And that's why with essentials, this will sell out. These shirts used to sell for $40 because bamboo fabric is not cheap. But I went to the factory. I renegotiated prices for the first time ever. These are the best t-shirts in the world. We're selling them in packs of three for $50. That means each t-shirt will only cost you $16. This is the best t-shirt in the world. It makes any of these t-shirts look bad. Yet it's cheaper than most of these t-shirts when you buy them in packs of three. Bro, this is incredible. This is the best offer we've ever done, and it's probably going to sell out. So if I were you, I'd run. Click that link down below and grab some bundles for yourself because this will fly. Number four, five ways to be more cold in school. This will be interesting. Let's see. Five, don't smile often. Having a smile on your face looks inviting and warm, drawing people to you. Okay, I can agree with that. If you smile too much, you might look too giddy. Whereas when you're more serious, you look a bit more dominant and mysterious, which could be attractive. All right, next. Walk as slow as a turtle, even when you are late for school. You don't want to be that annoying guy in the hallways, bro, that's slow as a turtle, slowing everybody down, thinking that you look cool. Don't do that. You should aim to have slower movements. So when you're talking to people, you want to move slower because it makes you look like you're in control and you feel confident. If you have fast and erratic motions, you're always running to class. Yeah, you're going to look nervous and you're going to seem like you're always out of control. Next. Three, don't ask a lot of questions. Asking other... Fully disagree with this one. When you're in conversation with people, you want to ask more questions. People love talking about themselves. The more questions you ask, the more they'll like you. Next. Two, don't talk about yourself. Wrong again. Disagree with this completely. If you don't like someone, move them from your life completely. But you don't got to insult or offend them, insulting somebody. It's a habit of a low quality man. Final one. Be willing to hurt someone's feelings. If people's energy doesn't resonate with you, be eager to cut them off without regrets. 100%. I agree here. Apologizing when you're not in the wrong, it's useless and it makes you look weak. Instead of saying stuff like, sorry I'm late, you can say, thanks for waiting. Instead of saying, sorry for bumping into you, you can say, excuse me. Out of this entire tip, there's only two solid facts everything else you should ignore. Number five. Three ways to elevate your style for school. Let's watch. Gentlemen, please don't be the guy that's trying to carry everything and it's falling over. 100% agreed. As a guy, if you want to maintain your composure, you want to look like you're in control and juggling all your books and stuff, it's not going to do that. A slick backpack not only elevates your style, it makes you look like you're in control. How are you going to say you're a stylish guy if you don't wear a watch? A man's onto something. Bro, a nice watch. Get understand, as a young guy, a lot of people won't treat you with that level of maturity that you're looking for. As soon as you put on a nice watch, people start respecting you. All right, let's go to the next one. You need to layer your outfit by putting a hoodie over your shirt. We're even wearing a denim jacket over your shirt. Of course. Yes, layering is such an easy way to elevate your style, especially when you're in school. If you want to dress better, layering makes your outfits more dynamic. I'm doing that right now. Putting a simple t-shirt under your hoodie or your jacket, 10 out of 10, all three tips, you should 100% do. Number six. All right, let's see. This dude says, do this before you go to bed to increase your exam scores. Let's watch. Before you go to bed at night, the very last thing you should see is that piece of paper. If you go to bed and right before you go to bed, you watch a horror movie. That's normally the last thing you think about, right? If you are trying to really take your exam testing to the next level, the last thing that you should see before you go to bed is the exam score that you want. Okay, this is actually true. As a matter of fact, I had to research it myself and I found a study conducted at a Notre Dame University. It tested this theory out with undergraduate student, the researchers. They invited the students into two groups. The first group was taught word pairs right before bed. The second group was taught those same word pairs, but they were taught them in the morning right after waking up. Both groups then had their memories tested 30 minutes, 12 hours, and 24 hours after being taught the word pair. Now, after 30 minutes, their test scores were very similar. However, after 12 hours, the group that had slept on that on the word pairs outperformed the group that had stayed awake all day. But what's interesting is that after 24 hours, the group that had stayed up all day and then was tested in the morning outperformed the first group, which means you should always prioritize studying right before bedtime for better retention. But more importantly, if you have a choice, always choose an earlier exam rather than a later one. If you apply these two techniques, it's an absolute fact you're going to do better on your exam. Now, by this point, you're learning how to pose for your picture so you look good online. You're using the blurting technique to get better grades. You learn what black t-shirt will make you look more attractive. You also learn control movements to look more confident. You learn how to elevate your style in school. And now you've learned slight techniques that will improve your exam score. All of these are not only just making you look good, but they're making you perform well, which is what you need to become that student. But you shouldn't just try to make school great. You should want it to be great for you. You should want to enjoy school. And to do that, you're going to need these three last tips. Number seven, casual looks for school. All right, let's watch. I like this. See, a nice flannel. It's a great option to dress up your stuff without it being stuffy. Now, for flannels, always choose darker colors. They look better. The brighter stuff, it looks like you just came off a farm. All right, next fit. That's crispy, bro. That's clean, especially when you have a crispy white T like that. It just stands out. Also, notice how he's wearing white shoes in all his outfits. That's because white shoes are the easiest way to make your outfits look more stylish. And you can use them every day. Next fit. Did you catch that? You see what he's doing here, right? We just went over this layering technique. He's doing it with a simple white shirt. Like I'm doing now. You pick one up. It's the fastest way to make your outfits look better. All of these are great. Number eight, how to look more attractive in two weeks. All right, let's watch. Here's how I went from this to this in only two weeks. Damn, that's a huge change for two weeks, bro. I have my concerns with this, but let's see what he says. I wanted to get a messy, fluffy and wavy hair look. This is what my hair is kind of looking like. Okay, he got a nice haircut. Every guy, if you get a haircut, you're going to immediately look better. Next. Next was getting clear skin. I made sure to wash my face at least two times a day. He's on the right track, cleaning your face twice a day. Smart to do if you want to clear your acne. Also, ice rolling can help tremendously. After that was getting a better jaw line. I started practicing my tongue posture by Mewi and started chewing gum. I think he's capping at this part, bro. Say to actually increase muscle, you need to stimulate growth by overstimulating the muscle. I don't know if that can be achieved by just chewing regular gum, and even if it could, you're not going to see results that fast in two weeks. Now, I agree with all his advice. I don't think it's going to happen in two weeks for you, but you should try it all. Number nine, how to always smell good at school. Yo, what's up, man? Damn, bro. I'm going to be honest with you. You stink. That happens way too much, bro. You dab somebody off and they just smell off. You'll never tell them to their face, but you don't want to be that guy. Number one is to brush your tongue because your tongue actually holds 70% of the bacteria in your mouth. Absolutely. Your tongue is filled with bacteria. Next. Number two is to use a luffa when you shower. Look, his advice is good at all, but he's focusing on bacteria. He's not actually showing you how to smell good. So here's how you're going to do that. You're going to start by applying anti-perspirate after showering and right before heading to school. Remember, anti-perspirate is not the same thing as deodorant. Anti-perspirate blocks the sweat while deodorant masks the odor. So you want to apply anti-perspirate first and then layer on deodorant. Finally, you're going to finish off with your favorite cologne, but don't just spray it randomly. You need to apply it to your post point, like your wrists and your neck for maximum effect. What he said in the video is true, but with these tips, you're going to actually smell amazing. And if you do all the advice you saw in this video, bro, you're going to have an amazing school year."

        "transcript": " Yo, when I was back in school, I knew this guy named Liam. Now, Liam always told me he'd be rich someday, but all Liam did was party and chase girls. For the last 10 years, I've talked to this guy named, which by the way, Liam's not his real name. I've talked to this guy named Liam at least once a year, just to catch up, how's everything going, et cetera. Every time I talked to him, he's telling me about some new business idea that's gonna make him rich this year. Here's the thing, he never takes action. He's incredibly ambitious, but he's also lazy. That is exactly why I'm making this video, because by the time you're done watching this, I want to be able to harness all that ambition that's inside of you and actually turn it into something real, so you're never lazy. Number one, let's test to see if you're a lazy guy. Ambitious yet lazy people are some of the most dangerous people in society. They will do whatever it takes to climb to the top without actually providing any value. They'll talk badly about you behind your back and they won't hesitate to throw you under the bus. Stay away from them. That's easier said than done, because spotting lazy people actually quite hard. So I'm gonna give you a quick test to see if you, or any of the friends around you are ambitious, but lazy. Do you exercise less than five times a week? Do you currently have chores that you left undone? Do you wake up after 9 a.m.? Do you eat out more than twice a week? And do you lie to cancel plans? Now, if you answered yes to more than three of these, you potentially could be lazy and possibly fall into this category. But I don't want you to freak out. I don't want you to worry, because I'm gonna make sure you never become an ambitious and lazy person. If you complete this video and put everything I'm about to show you in practice, use the Eisenhower Matrix to be productive, not just busy. Stop listening to your mom and your parents. You're probably not lazy at all. You just haven't learned how to separate what's truly important from what isn't. But don't stress it, bro. I'm gonna show you how to fix this using the Eisenhower Matrix. I want you to start right now and list everything that you need to do in your life. Right now, put it on a piece of paper. Then once that list is complete, I want you to break that list down into four categories. The first category is not urgent and not important tasks. These are distractions, like watching that Netflix show that your friend recommended or shopping for a shirt you liked. Next, you have urgent but unimportant tasks. These might include playing a video game at a specific time with a friend. After that, you have not urgent but important tasks. These could be exercising or studying. And finally, you have urgent and important tasks. These are your critical responsibilities, like turning in an assignment or meeting some work deadline. Now you're gonna create a hierarchy with your day by starting your day with always tackling your urgent and important tasks first. Once those are done, you're gonna move down to the important and non-urgent tasks. Then you're gonna go to urgent but not important. And finally, if you have any time left in the day, this is when you're gonna handle your non-urgent and non-important tasks. With this, you now have a clear idea of what it is that you need to focus on during the day so you no longer are a lazy person. But you knowing what you need to do is not gonna cure laziness. You and me both know that. The next step is to take action. And for that, you need tip number three. Number three, use pair bonding to make leveling up fun. To stop being lazy. You need to brainwash yourself to love doing boring things and you'll never be lazy again. Now, to be able to brainwash yourself, your brain needs three things. You need to enjoy the task. You need to not even realize you're doing that task. And three, you need to actually crave to do that task. I'm gonna show you how to achieve all three with whatever boring task you have using something called pair bonding. Let's take something like a skincare routine. The reason you're not seeing results in your skincare routine is because you don't like doing it. Therefore, you're not consistent with it. Therefore, you never see results. And I'm just like you, bro. In fact, I used to hate exfoliating my face. The time I took to wash it off, it was just uncomfortable on the skin. It just took too much time. It felt like a chore. But now, I pair it with something I love, like listening to a podcast. This unlocks the first thing your brain needs, which is enjoying the task. Every morning, I hit play to a new podcast episode that I wanted to listen to. And then I just start exfoliating my face with my micro exfoliator from Geology. I've been using the same skincare products now for five years because again, I like to find stuff that's consistent and easy to do. And with Geology, I know I have great products and they just get delivered to my door every month. I don't wanna have to be going to the store and buying. But suddenly, my brain is now rewarded with dopamine. This is the neurotransmitter for pleasure and motivation. Now, instead of dreading my time in the bathroom, I actually look forward to it because I wanna finish that podcast episode. The second thing your brain needs is you not realizing you're even doing it. Well, my next step with my skincare would be to wash my face. Here's where I use my psilocylic acid, face wash from Geology. This is great to get rid of acne. While I'm doing this, I take advantage of something called cognitive distraction. I try to make a real effort to focus on the podcast and what's being said in it, especially if it's something entertaining. I almost forget that I'm washing my face because I am so hooked in what's happening. By the way, the one that I listened to this morning was on the huge expose on how honey is a huge scam for influencers. We've all seen it. As a matter of fact, I used to work with them back in like 2017. Allegedly, they've been scamming everyone. I don't know if it's true or not, but I was so hooked into it, I'm not even realizing I'm washing my face. I want to know what happens next. But this is the great part. Over time, you develop the third thing your brain needs, which is associative learning. In other words, your brain's going to start to crave this routine. My brain starts to link that boring task of exfoliating and washing my face. And now my final step, which is moisturizing it. Again, I use Geology because it hasn't built an SPF and it just gets delivered to my door. So I know I have the three products every guy needs for a good skincare routine from Geology and I know these are award-winning products. So I don't even think about it. But now my brain associates me doing this whole system with fun and fulfillment that I'm looking forward to because I want to listen to that next episode or that next podcast, which is why that routine that I once hated doing every morning, I have now brainwashed myself. So it becomes a moment of relaxation and reward for me. And that is when you become consistent and actually see results. You can literally apply this method I just showed you to any boring routine you dislike, cleaning a room, working, studying, you can apply pair bonding with all of that. And if you guys want a simple skincare routine that actually works, go check out Geology. Bro, I've been working with these guys for five years. I'm going to have them linked down below with the special discount code that takes almost 70% off. I want you to start with the best skin of your life.

If you guys want to check out Geology, it'll be linked down below. Number four, outwork everyone using cooperative reward structures. Have you ever noticed that you get yourself harder every time there's hot girls around you? Bro, I met Work Harder. I don't know what the hell I was saying. You get what I'm saying though. That feeling you feel when there's like a hot girls that you're in go mode. That feeling, that's not random just to you. It's science and you can use it to outwork anyone around. You see, in a recent study, researchers gathered 46 students and split them into three groups. The first group, they worked alone on a variety of quizzes. The second group worked in pairs on the same quizzes. And the third group worked on quizzes individually, but they were alongside others in the same room. Out of the three groups, the third group outperformed all the others. A result researchers attributed to to cooperative reward structures and social accountability. In simple terms, this means that people will work harder when the results are their own, but others are looking at them through the work. So if you wanna use this for yourself, here's a five level system you can do to outwork anyone. Level one, you can study alone from your room, but you can open a YouTube video, study with me where you're studying while somebody else is also studying alongside you. Level two, you can call a friend on Zoom or on Discord. So you can have a real person to study alongside as you study. Level three, we'll take it up a notch. I want you to join an online study group on Discord. The best one that I found is called study together. Level four, get out of your room now. Don't study alone. Go to a coffee shop or a library where there's a lot of people and that way you can study while others are looking at you. And level five, bring a friend along to join you to study in a public library or a coffee shop. But there is one potential problem with this method. You might end up getting distracted and you're gonna start talking about other things other than the work that's in front of you. However, your brother has you because you can prevent this from happening with my next tip. Number five, you will work based on your attention span. You think your attention span is cooked and it's bad, but that's wrong. Your attention span is perfectly fine. You just need to learn how to use it. You see, when it comes to working in these long periods, whether it's for work or school, most guys they'll fall into two categories, but there's a third way to do it that surpasses both of them. The first group is smart. They'll use the Pomodoro technique. This is when you set a timer for 20 minutes and you work and then you set a five minute timer. And after 20 minutes are done, you set a five minute timer to relax. This is good. The second group has no technique. They just think, all right, I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna study or work as long as I possibly can. This is not ideal. Now, the third way to do it, which is superior to all of them, is studying based on your own attention span. This means you will only study based on the amount of time you can personally stay focused without needing a break. And this is how you're gonna find it. First, you're gonna work with complete focus by turning off your phone. The very moment you feel your concentration slipping, like you need to look elsewhere or look for something else, I want you to stop and write down how long it took you to break focus. After you stop studying, do something relaxed. Go for a short walk, go for a snack, maybe play a little bit of a video game. Once you feel ready to work again, know how long it took you to get to that point. Now, you're gonna repeat this process all day. At the end of the day, you're gonna take the average of all your focus time and the average of all your relaxation time. Once you know what your attention span is, you can now customize the Pomodoro technique that I just talked about to your specific attention span. So for example, maybe for you, you can only work for five to 10 minutes of focus, but you need 15 minutes of relaxation. So that means your Pomodoro will be 10 minutes of work, 15 minutes of relaxation, and you'll do that all day to get the most output possible. Look, by now, you understand if you're an ambitious guy, that's just lazy, but you also understand how to eliminate laziness, how to actually get things done, and how to never lose focus. All of that because you watched this one singular video, which is the best decision you've ever taken, but to truly become an unstoppable machine that reaches every ambition you've ever set out to, you need to implement my last tip. Number six, find your caffeinated therapeutic window. If you wanna work harder, learn to drink coffee based on your body weight. Look, I don't care where you're getting your caffeine from. Most guys think, oh, you should only get your caffeine from coffee, you can get your caffeine from anything. Energy drinks, coffee, tea, as long as you're drinking it based on your body weight. According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine, it doesn't matter where you're getting your caffeine from. As long as you're doing two milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight, you'll have all the energy and focus you need. So to make it as simple as possible for you, I built this chart. You can pause the video, take a screenshot, where it's gonna show you how much caffeine you need based on your body weight and what that equals to in coffee, energy drinks, tea, or matcha. It's as simple as it gets. Basically, this is your daily limit based on what you weigh. Now, you're gonna notice, you're gonna work longer and no longer have those crashes or jitters or that anxious feeling because you're actually drinking the right amount of caffeine. Boys, this is the most important video you've ever watched to finish the year because next year, I want you to be equally as ambitious as you've ever been. Don't get demotivated, but the only difference is you will actually put everything into action with everything I showed you in this video. Let's crush it next year, bro."

        "transcript": " Most men, they don't know their hair type. Because of this, most guys can never find the right hairstyle. So I'm going to make you a promise. By the end of this video, you're going to know exactly what your hair type is. And then what's the right hairstyle or your type of hair? One, use the right haircut for your curl pattern. Most men get bad haircuts because they have no idea what their curl pattern is, making them just look terrible. So here's how to easily find out what your curl pattern is. First, grab a strand of hair from your brush, from your bathroom, and look at strands 1A, 1B, and 1C. These fall under the straight hair category. If your hair looks like this, that means you have straight hair. Next, we'll go to 2A, 2B, and 2C. If your hair matches these, you have wavy hair. It's just my type of hair. Now, we'll move on to 3A, 3B, and 3C. If your hair strand resembles any of these patterns, that means you have curly hair. And finally, we have 4A, 4B, and 4C. If your hair strand resembles any of these, that means you have coily hair. Now, here's the right hairstyle you should be using. If you have straight hair, this is sleek and easy to maintain, but it often lacks volume and texture. So you're gonna stick to styles like the crew cut, the pompadour, the slick back, or the side part. Wavy hair has natural volume and texture, but it can easily get frizzy, so it naturally requires more upkeep. Ideal styles are the quiff, the french crop, the textured fringe, or the side part. Curly hair has tons of character and volume, but it can quickly become messy and keep it manageable. Up for textured fringes, french crops, or bus cuts. Coily hair is thick and it's full of texture. However, it can appear shorter than it actually is because it's coiled up. So for you, you can go for bus cuts, textured fringes, or even the french crop. By this point, you now know what hair type you have and what hairstyle you should use for it. However, this is only useful if you're getting the right fade. You're treating your hair according to your needs and using the right hair products for your hair type. If you don't do any of these, you'll never get that perfect hairstyle you've always looked for. Which is why, number one to number two, you're going to wash your hair this many times based on your scalp. If you wake up and your hairstyle is always looking different, you can never just have a good hair day every day. It's because you don't know how to take care of your scalp. So I'm gonna show you how to figure it out. Tomorrow morning, you're gonna wake up, you're gonna wash your hair like you normally would with shampoo and conditioner, and then go out about your day. At the end of the day, you're gonna take a paper towel, just like I'm doing here, and you're gonna press it up against your scalp. Then take a look at the paper towel. If you see visible oil on it, it means you have an oil-y scalp. If you see no oil, get rid of the towel, and I want you to look very closely in the mirror at your scalp. Get in there as close as possible like I'm doing, pulling your hair apart, really getting to the scalp. If your scalp looks normal, that means you have normal scalp, you're good to go. But if you notice a lot of cracks on your scalp, this means you have dry skin or dry scalp. Now, if you have an oil-y scalp, you're gonna wash and condition your hair three times a week. If you have a normal scalp, you're gonna wash and condition your hair twice a week. And for dry scalp, you will just wash and condition your hair once a week. Number three, take care of your hair based on your age. You need to learn how to take care of your hair based on what your age is. A recent study analyzed a group of men between the ages of 18 and 29, and analyzed how much hair loss they've experienced. The result was that 16% of men had already experienced moderate to extreme hair loss between 18 and 29. Most think that you won't start losing your hair until your 30s, but you're probably already losing your hair now, and you need to learn how to take care of your hair depending your age. So, if you're between the ages of 18 and 29, your focus should be to reduce the chances of losing moderate to severe hair loss by stopping DHT or dehydra testosterone, the hormone that's responsible for hair loss. You can do this by eating certain foods that contain key ingredients like biotin, zinc, and iron. Eggs are a great source for all three of those. Here's the catch. One egg will give you about 40% of your daily recommended biotin intake, while only providing 5% of the zinc that you need and only 20% of the iron that you need. This means you gotta eat 20 eggs a day to get enough nutrients to cover all three of these and stop hair loss. Now, I don't know about you. There's just no way I'm eating 20 eggs, bro, which is why supplements are so powerful like this one from Groplex. This one provides you the right amount of daily biotin, zinc, and iron, as well as other vitamins and minerals that have been scientifically proven to stop hair loss and also give you healthy hair. Now, if you're between the ages of 18 to 29, this is the hair care step you cannot miss. Take a supplement that blocks DHT and makes your hair healthy. And Groplex has one of the best formulations you'll ever find on the market. Now, if you're between the ages of 29 and 39, a different study took a look at this specific demographic. They found on average over 35% of men were already experiencing extreme hair loss. That's exactly why a few years ago, I started experimenting with scalp massaging. This stimulates your hair follicles and stimulates blood flow, which carries nutrients to your scalp to keep your hair healthy. And to do it, it's free. You just need your fingertips and you start massaging your scalp in multiple directions. You could do this even when you shower and you're shampooing and conditioning your hair. According to the study, just doing this simple thing can lead to an increase of 3% of hair thickness. If you wanna boost this thickness even more, you can use something like a derma roller where this study showed that just using a derma roller can boost hair thickness by up to 9%. That's why I've always recommended a derma roller for years. This one is also from GrowPlex and it has titanium needles at 0.75 millimeters. This is important. If your needle is not long enough or too long, it won't penetrate the scalp where you needed to to force those nutrients to come into your scalp and help with hair growth. This roller creates small controlled injuries in the scalp, which will then trigger your body's natural healing process, creating more collagen, more protein, and ultimately making your hair thicker. So if you're between the ages of 29 and 39, you must have a derma roller. And by the way, even the younger group, you should use it. I started using a derma roller at 21 and that's why I'm keeping all of my hair. So at this age group, you should not only be taking a supplement, you should be using a derma roller. If you're over 39, you will most likely need the most important thing out of all three of it because this is the strongest one to take care of your hair because this study found that 53% of men over 39 had extreme hair loss already. So that could either be you watching it, or maybe it's your dad, your uncle, your brother, somebody in your family at this age, they need this information to tackle this. You will need some sort of serum, something that blocks the HT and it's strong. Now there are natural ones like rosemary oil and coconut oil you can use. However, if you're at this age and you already have extreme hair loss, not gonna be strong enough. This I recommend if you're younger and you have thick hair still. Your hair is gone, you will need minoxidil. Now, minoxidil can dry your scalp and it has a ton of side effects. This is why I prefer using Groplex formula. Groplex is formula, the foam has minoxidil but they also include biotin and other ingredients to help soothe the scalp. That way it's not as itchy or dry, especially if you have dry scalp. And now you're getting minoxidil, biotin, and other ingredients that help not only increase hair growth along the HT, but also keeps your hair healthy. No other company does this with this minoxidil. Their formulation I think is top tier and one of the best in the market. So I'm gonna make it simple for you. Whether you're 18 or over 40, every guy needs to start taking care of their hair now so you don't end up in turkey getting a hair transplant. If you guys want the vitamin, the dermaroller and their special minoxidil formulation and a bundle, I'm going to have them linked down below at the lowest price possible so you can start taking care of your hair now because this is the most important step you'll ever take in this entire video. If you don't have hair, who cares about your hairstyle? You guys are gonna check out Groplex, they'll be linked down below. Number four, you're gonna pick the right fade or your jawline. I want you to take a look at these before and after picture. And every one, the guy goes from looking like a four to looking like an eight, all because he got a fade. But here's the thing, a good fade, it can take you from a four to an eight. However, it can easily drop you from an eight to a four if you do the wrong one. The fade that you choose all depends on your face shape. Now, the easiest way to figure out your face shape, grab your phone and go to Face Shape Filter on TikTok. And then go through all the filters and find one where you see no spaces inside the white or that your jawline or your head doesn't go outside the white. For example, for me, the square face fits the best. Now, I want you to pause this video and check out the chart I'm showing you on screen. Find your face shape on screen so you can kind of see what are your most prominent features. Based on this, we're gonna choose the right fade for you. So for example, if you have an oval face, you can pull off pretty much any fade. However, if you wanna look the best, a mid fade will look good on you. However, like myself, if you have a square or even a round face, you wanna stick to a high fade as this is gonna elongate your face and make it look more balanced. Now, if you have an oblong face, meaning your face is very long, you wanna go for a very low fade to make your head look a bit shorter. And if you have a diamond face shape, you wanna have a mid fade to emphasize your cheekbones and look more attractive. Bro, by now, you know what hairstyle to use based on your curl type. How often you should wash your hair based on your scalp? How to take care of your hair based on your age? And now, what fade to use with the hairstyle that you chose to look the most attractive? I'm telling you, the promise I made you, we've almost completed it. You know where your hair type is and you know how to get the perfect hairstyle. But there's one last thing you need to know so you can always have good hair day. Number five, you're gonna pick the right hair product for your hair type. To know what hair product you should use, you need to understand your hair porosity because your hair porosity will affect how it absorbs and how it holds styling products. So it's important to choose the right products for your hair porosity. The good news is you can easily test this with a cup of water. You're going to pluck a hair from your head and place it in a cup of water. You can leave it there for a few minutes. If your hair sinks to the bottom, it means you have high porosity, which means it can absorb moisture and also lose moisture very quickly. For this hair type, you want products that hold your hair without weighing it down too much. Like gel, clay, all-style pomade and mousse. Now, if your hair floats in the middle of the water, that means you have normal porosity and you will want to use products that give you an even balance of both absorbing and maintaining moisture, such as hair creams, new-style pomade, wax or even spray. Now, if your hair is still floating on the surface, it means it has low porosity and it struggles to absorb moisture. For this, it means you want to use something that can help retain and absorb moisture, like mousse, wax or new-style pomade. And if you do these five steps, I promise you, like I did in the beginning of the video, you now know your hair type and you also now know what hair style to choose."

        "transcript": " There's a lot of misinformation online when it comes to having a perfect skincare routine. So in today's video, I'm going to try and show you the only skincare routine you will ever need using science and research, all to ensure that you have clear skin. This routine will be simple to use and work with your own skin's biology. Before we even get started, you need to understand how our skin biology works. Our skin is made up of three layers, epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous fat layer. The most important layer when it comes to a skincare routine is your epidermis layer. Now, within the epidermis layer, there's three other layers, but there's only two you need to worry about, the acid mantle and the lipid layer. For you to have perfect skin, you need to clean, moisturize, and protect these two layers. But here comes the hard part that I'm going to solve for you using science, how to find the right products that work for your specific skin type. Look, I promise you, this is not going to be a science class, but if you can understand this little section, bro, I'm going to solve all your skin problems. Move on to the first product. You need to cleanse for your skin type. I want you to stop washing your face unless you're using the right face wash for your skin type. Using the Ron Cleanser will cause your skin to break out, develop blackheads, and leave your skin looking dehydrated. And look, there's three different skin types. You have oily skin, combination skin, and dry skin. And for you to figure out what skin type you have, I need you to do the T-zone test. All I want you to do is wet your hands and dampen your face with some water and don't dry your face. Let it air dry naturally. After about an hour, come back to the bathroom and look at your face. If your face is shiny, it means you have an oily skin type. If your face is dry or flaky, it means you have a dry skin type. And if you have combination skin, you'll know because you'll have a shiny T-zone with dry cheeks. Now that you know your skin type, this is the right cleanser you should be using. If you have oily skin, you should be using a foaming cleanser and look for certain key ingredients, like silica and niacinamide. If you have dry skin, you should use a non foaming cleanser and look for key ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin, and aloe vera. Now if you have normal combination skin, a gentle cleanser will be best for you. And by the way, your cleansers, they don't have to include all the ingredients I mentioned above. You want to make sure it has at least one or two of them. Now that was a lot of information. So to make it even easier for you, here's a chart with a summary of everything you should look for and a specific cleanser for your specific skin type. Now, when it comes to using a cleanser, you got to make sure you do it properly. First, use lukewarm water rather than really cold or really hot water as these will disrupt your natural skin barrier. Second, you only need about a quarter size amount of cleanser. Third, you should only apply between 30 and 60 seconds on your face. And fourth, you want to make sure you rinse off all residue. Now to really exfoliate your face, you should use a scrubber. If you want to take exfoliation to the next level, this is an extra step, not needed, but if you want perfect skin, I 100% recommend. And it's getting a microdermabrasion tool. This one's from PMD, which has a tiny spinny disc at the end that helps exfoliate the skin. It's almost like I scrub my skin down to remove any dead skin cells, which promotes cellular regeneration, giving me youthful skin. Bro, your boy's trying to have perfect skin forever. That's what I want you to have as well. And that's what this tool gives me. On top of that, this PMD tool also has a built-in calibrated vacuum tool. So when you're using it, it's basically sucking your skin, which promotes more blood flow, which promotes collagen production. It makes your skin super firm. The PMD tool, it should be an every guy's skin routine. Doesn't matter what your skin type is. I'm going to have it linked down below, because for the holidays, it's at an absolute steal right now. You're not going to find it any cheaper than this. I'm going to have a special discount now. Two, you need to moisturize every day. The problem is that you're using the wrong moisturizer. You'll probably think, oh, any moisturizer is going to hydrate my skin and give me that healthy glow. Wrong. You need to use the best moisturizer for your skin type. This is because your skin is constantly losing water throughout its pores as the day goes on. Ehydrated skin will cause a ton of problems like acne and can even cause oiliness because your skin will start to overproduce oil to overcompensate for that dryness. To avoid all of this, it is essential that you replace this lost water with the moisturizer that's made for your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for moisturizers that have ingredients like psilocylic acid, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. For people with dry skin, you should look for moisturizers that have aloe vera, glycerin, and shea butter. And for people with combination skin, you should look for moisturizers that have vitamin C, lactic acid, and ceramides. And again, it doesn't need to have all of these ingredients. It just needs to have one of each list, which again, to make it simple for you, here's an easy chart that you can screenshot. So next time you're shopping for these products online or in person, look for these ingredients for your skin type. Now to really enhance the effect of these moisturizers, I like to use my PMD microdome abrasion tool right after I've washed my face. This is when I use the tool because now I'm removing all that dead skin and it's really opening up my pores. When you do this, you are setting yourself up for maximum skin absorption of all those ingredients. This allows whatever moisturizer you buy to work 10 times more effective because now there's no layer blocking it and now your skin can actually be moisturized. But in order to get the most out of your moisturizer, don't just rub the moisturizer on your face. Instead, you should push the moisturizer on your face to apply moisturizer correctly. You want to apply about a nickel sized amount onto your palm, then with your other index finger, you're going to apply dots all over your face. Then you're going to push it into your skin, into your pores. You will not smear or rub it in. When you do this, you're going to get all the benefits of it locking in the moisture and keeping your skin looking tight. This application process I just showed you is the most efficient way to apply moisturizer, but it won't matter if you still have a ton of dead skin or clogged pores, which is why I'm telling you, I don't care what skin type you are. Every man needs a personal microdome abrasion tool in their bathroom. You have to understand to get this done at a derm's office, you're going to be paying around $1,500 to do about 10 sessions, which is what's needed to see your skin truly change. You only got to pay a tenth of that by clicking the link down below. Actually, it's going to be less than that if you apply the discount because for the holidays, they have an insane offer. And now you have something that dermatologists use to get perfect skin in your bathroom and you can use it whenever you want. And when you do use it, I'm telling you right now, it is easily one of the most impactful changes you will ever make to your skin. If you want to have perfect skin and you want it to be quick, this is the tool to get. You do this with what I'm teaching you in this video, bro, you will never have to watch another skincare video in your life. If you guys want to check out PMD and their microdome abrasion, it's going to be linked down below with a special discount. Like I said, for the holidays, this is the cheapest you'll ever find. So buy your cell phone, buy one for your friend or your girlfriend, whoever, because this is a gift anybody would want. And step three of your skincare routine, you need to use a sunscreen every morning, but you need to stop using chemical based sunscreens. This is a problem because you think you're doing something good for your face by using these sunscreens, but you're not. When you use the wrong one, this is what causes your skin to break out and cause acne all over your face. Now, out of the entire skincare routine, this is your most important step because this is what's going to prevent premature aging, fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. It's so impactful that according to the English Journal of Medicine, there was a 69 year old man who was a truck driver and his entire life he was exposed to the sun coming in from the left side of the driver's seat. As you can see from this image, the left side of his face aged drastically compared to the right side of his face. To prevent this from ever happening to your entire face, you need to use the right sunscreen. For dry skin, it is essential to use sunscreens that are also moisturizing. So any ingredient like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or shea butter is needed to not only keep your skin hydrated but also protected from the sun. If you have oily or combination skin, you need to opt for oil-free non-commodogenic sunscreens. These are less likely to clog pores and exaberate your acne. Now, there is one last non-negotiable that I have with every sunscreen. Whatever sunscreen you buy, you need to make sure it's labeled as broad spectrum. The University of Chicago Medicine recommends a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. All this means is that it will protect you against both UVA and UVB rays, which both can be harmful for your skin. Now, you only have to apply it every morning in two easy steps. First, you're going to apply a quarter size amount into your palms and then work it in almost pushing it in like the moisturizer. If you have darker skin like I do, you're going to get a white cast, which is why I always recommend a tinted sunscreen for my darker colored dudes. Second, there are combination sunscreens and moisturizers. If you get that and you find the right one with all the ingredients that I showed you in this video, now your perfect skincare routine is literally only two products. To sum it all up, a cleanser, a moisturizer, and a sunscreen is all you need to have clear skin that is science-based. Now, to make it easier for you, here is a complete chart of everything you'll need for your skin type and the products that you'll need. If you follow this, bro, you're going to solve all your skincare problems overnight."

But we're gonna fix that because to stop doom-scrolling you need to fill your life with something that makes you money, something that helps you socialize, something that keeps you in shape, something that grows your mind, and something that keeps you creative. But it's crucial that you introduce each of these in the right order. And in today's video I'm going to show you exactly how to do that. Start with number one. Use the seven stories method to make money. If you're unsure what career to choose or you don't know what major to pick when you go to college, here's an exercise that Harvard Business School gives to students that I want you to do. First, take out a piece of paper and write down your life's 25 biggest accomplishments. Next, you're gonna rank them based on how they impacted your life. Once you've done that, you're gonna pick the top seven and completely throw away the rest. Next, you're gonna write a story next to each of those seven accomplishments focusing on what made each of them so important or impactful to you. But there's one final step. You're gonna read through all your stories and you're gonna make a new list of any specific keywords that keep reappearing. For example, you might notice four of the accomplishments, they revolve around teaching someone, which could suggest that you would thrive as a teacher, or maybe you notice that five of them suggest that you love creating stuff with your hands, pointing to a career in building or engineering. Once you've done that, you've identified your vocation. See, these rocks represent just that and your vocation is not only what's gonna make you happy, but it's also what's gonna make you money. Now, as you can see, there's still plenty of space in this jar, which is your life, to be filled with more purpose or more doom scroll, which is why I explain in the video. It is important that you do everything in order, so you fill your jar up with purpose. Number two, make everyone addicted to you with these 10 habits. If you do that six things I'm about to show you, people are just gonna get addicted to you and First, you will say their name when you're in conversation, when you first read them, or when you leave. You see, people love hearing their name more than any other word. Second, stop trying to read books on how to socialize. Instead, you need to start tolerating that uncomfortable feeling you get when you do socialize. Your brain's just gonna take over and make it easier for you. Look, if you feel anxious, you gotta push yourself to talk to more and more people. And look, if you don't have a friend or anybody to talk to, signing up to a service like BetterHelp can be life changing. With their sponsor BetterHelp, you can practice speaking to someone or to work through your anxieties with a licensed profession. Third, find the passion of the person you're talking to. Look at their clothing, their bag, their phone background, even their apps on their phone. Find something you can ask them about, but they're passionate for it. And they're gonna do all the talking for you. Fourth, instead of trying to become interesting, try to become interested. To show this, while you're listening, I want you to nod your head like you're interested. Also, you can say words like, aha, okay. Really, all of these just show that you're really interested in the other person. And you'll have to practice these with a friend, a buddy, or even on BetterHelp with a licensed therapist, where they can help you learn how to build your listening skills. Because when you first sign up with them, they're gonna ask you a series of questions about your personal life and about your goals. Then they'll pair you with someone who's best suited for your situation. So if you want to become more sociable, for example, you want to find a therapist that specializes in social anxiety. Fifth, lose open facial expression. You want to slightly smile and squint your eyes to show interest. Just look at the difference between these two images. On the left, I look awkward, like I'm in shock. On the right, it looks like I'm engaged or happy to be there. And sixth, increase your interactions with random people. Start by making eye contact and giving a nod. Then progress and start saying hi to people. You can compliment them on something they're wearing and then slowly build up until you can feel comfortable going up to people and ask them how their days go. Again, even if you can't practice this with a buddy, a brother, or a sister, or a family member, all of you can sign up to a service like BetterHelp, which I'm going to have a link down below. You can go to betterhelp.com.com slash men's fashion and you can try it with them. The cool part with this is that you could do it from the comfort of your home and you could do however you feel the most comfortable, whether it's texting, video message, or phone call. BetterHelp will always have a therapist for you to engage with in the format you feel the most comfortable. And if you don't connect well with your therapist, they'll easily replace it with somebody else because they have thousands of licensed therapists in their platform to make sure you're connected with somebody that you can actually resonate with and feel comfortable. Again, if you guys want to check out BetterHelp, you can go to betterhelp.com slash men's fashion or click the link down below. Now, at this point, it would seem like you're starting to run out of space in your jar, which is your life. From all the purpose you built into it, don't be confused because there's still many gaps in your life where you're going to start bringing out your phone and still doom-scrolling and fall back into that addiction. Just while there's three more purposes I want you to develop to fully get rid of any addiction and fill your life with purpose. Number three, pick a sport with the highest degree of difficulty. When you look in the mirror and you see yourself with twigs for arms, here's what you're going to do to get in the best shape of your life. Instead of going to the gym and cranking out way too much weight, you're going to go to Google and type in ESPN Sports Difficulty Radiant. Click the first link at the top of the page. Here, you're going to find what ESPN calls the degree of difficulty project. This project had a team of world-class experts assess in 10 different categories to determine which are the most difficult sports in the world. So, you're going to take the five toughest sports in the world, which are wrestling, basketball, football, ice hockey, and boxing. After that, pick one of the five sports that you're the most interested in and you're going to start playing either with your team or a local team in your area. Now, each week that you start getting a better and better shape, you start filling your life with more and more purpose. This prevents you from doing schooling, but this is not where I want you to stop because you need to understand there's still more space in this garlet for you to develop other passions like something that gives you knowledge. Four, stop treating reading like it's a chore. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, six, six, seven. This is the number of books your average CEO reads a year because reading is the most effective way to grow your mind. The reason you haven't been able to do the same is because you feel reading is a chore. So, here are five ways to stop doing that and make reading easy. First, don't read books just because people online tell you to. Instead, you should read books that excite you and interest you. Next, unless you're reading a story-driven book, you don't have to start all the way at the beginning. You can jump straight to the chapter that matters to you the most at that moment. Next, if you find yourself getting bored with the book, you don't got to force yourself to finish it. You can put it down and find something else that interests you. Finally, place books all around your home next to your bed and the bathroom and delivering all of these situations. It's much better to grab a book and lead than to doom scroll. This way, every time you see it around your house, it's like you're constantly giving yourself a nudge to read instead of being on your phone. And just like that, you're now feeling your life with something that grows your mind. Now, at this point, you're probably thinking, Jose, there is no way I'm going to doom scroll with all of this going on in my life. But you're wrong because there's still enough space here and I want you to develop one more purpose. Number five, use deliberate discomfort to 10x your creativity. First, I want to see if any of you have a creative mind. So to do that, I'm going to show you five images without any context. I want you to either write down in the comments or even say it out loud what you think each image looks like. If your answer matches what I'm going to put on screen, it means you're probably not being that creative because that's the answer most people chose. So just so you know, I haven't seen the images either. So I'm going to react with you. Here we go. All right, this, I mean, this is obvious. It looks like a candlestick, like a stock trading candlestick. You know what I'm talking about? Okay, the boy's not being creative. Let's go. Number two, right? It looks like a globe and like everything pointing into feet. So like all roads lead to you. I don't even know what that means. Okay, clock. Oh, at least I didn't get the average one. What did you get? All right, let's go to number three. Okay, come on, that's a compass, bro. Like what else do you see there? Obviously, everybody chose compass. All right, let's go to number four. I have noid T bone steak, several T bone steaks. Oh, come on. A giraffe neck. I did not see that one. How the heck did people get that as the average answer? Let's go to number five. Uh, bacteria, I think, lights. Okay, not bad. Look, if you got three or more of your answers, the same as what the average is what I put on screen, yo, we're probably not being too creative here. Which means that's a good thing because now you can find something creative in your life to fill in that last bit of space in your jar. For you to become more creative, you need to engage into something that introduces you to new ideas and new concepts. This is something that they call deliberate discomfort. And honestly, one of the easiest ways to do this that everyone can do is learn new language. But rather than just sitting and reading a book on trying to learn new language, here's what you're going to do. I want you to replay whatever your favorite video game is in your target language. I want you to rewatch your favorite shows and whatever language you're trying to learn. Then I want you to revisit your favorite comics and books in that language you want to learn. And finally, download a language app like Duolingo so you can practice while you're bored. By this point, you will have completely filled your life with passions, killed boredom, and not have an ounce of energy or time left to be Doomscroll."

        "transcript": " So you don't get girls. Don't worry, your brother's here to help. Because using the power of science and hormones, I'm gonna show you exactly how attraction works. You see, for a girl to feel attracted to you, her body needs to produce six specific hormones. The first one of these is vasopressin, which is extremely easy to trigger if you understand how girls work. Fix me to number one. Do you actually know girls? Here's a test to see if you're a girl, so we're about to look at five images without context. All right. Now, here's how it's gonna work. I haven't seen this video yet. I'm gonna react to it at the same time you are. So we're both gonna be showing five images without context. And we gotta figure out what it means. If we get less than three of these correct, it means we don't know girls, bro. Ain't no way I'm about to fail this test. Let's go. All right, so first up, we have this chair. I remember these at school, bro. And the funny part is, anytime you sat behind a girl, you knew that they were always complaining that their hair would get stuck to it. Let's see. Lumbar or something? Oh, he's not gonna give you the answer. Next up. All right. At the end, I'm gonna find the answer to all of these and post them on screen. Let's go. Number two. Shampoo fully conditioned. Oh, come on. This is K-D, bro. Yeah, I just realized. Obviously, you're supposed to condition your hair every day and shampoo every other day, meaning you'll always run out of conditioner first. Yo, come on. All right, next one. This is a hair tie. It looks like it's starting to come apart a bit. So maybe just a little in constant use. Yo, they got me with this one. All right, if you know this one, you gotta comment it down below. Next one, number four. I have no idea what's in these. What the hell is that? I don't know what would create that black on there. I don't know where the heck they're shoving these Q-tips and it's for sure not their ears. I'm gonna say makeup. Actually, I have no idea. Last one. I cannot get less than three here. Okay, I know. Here we go. I've been to stores with like these. Okay, easy. Every girl has the color of the makeup to match their skin right on the back of their hair. Come on, girl. All right, for those of you curious about the answers, your boy got three out of five. All right, I'm gonna post them right here. And that's the point. You need to know women and understand them. As a matter of fact, according to a study, men that grew up with sisters are far happier, healthier, and do way better with women than those men that didn't grow up with sisters. The reason is because they have a much better understanding with women. And those men, when they are around women, it causes them to release vasopressin, which is a social bonding hormone women release when they feel safe or understood, which is why you need to understand women to make or produce this first hormone and get her to like you. Bro, your boy is cooking today. I'm gonna show you how attraction truly works. And not with the basic advice you hear everywhere else. I'm gonna use science and hormones to scientifically get your crush to like you. And we just unlocked hormone number one. We got five more to go. Number two, you're gonna stress her out to make her like you more. Stress her out and raise her cortisol. And I promise you, she's gonna fall in love with you. You see, in a recent study, researchers ran a speed dating event and they found that women with higher levels of cortisol, which came from the stress and the time pressure of the event, were more attracted to men who also had high cortisol levels. Why? Well, it shows the woman that when she is in high levels of stress, the guy that she's with is able to manage that stress. This makes you appear much more in control and therefore makes you irresistible. Now, you can't exactly run a speed dating event every time you go on a date, but if you wanna recreate similar results in your life or in your dating life and you wanna spike cortisol in her, you want to take her on dates where both of you experience a little bit of stress. For example, go to a scary movie, try a roller coaster or a theme park, take her to an escape room or do something competition-based like Go Karni. You do that, it's just gonna be far more likely to wanna date you, as you've already unlocked the second hormone. But just know, none of this will matter if you ignore this next important hormone of attraction. Number three, debunking the myth of physical attraction. Most men think attraction comes down to your genetics when you were born with, but this is further from the truth. As a matter of fact, in a study, researchers surveyed 117 male and female students of what they found the most attractive in the opposite sex. What they found is that attraction had way less to do with genetic traits like height and bone structure and had more to do with factors you can control, like your hair, your grooming, and your skin. Here's how you're gonna optimize all three. Now, for all three of these, there's myths that you believe are making you look better. Scientifically, you're doing it all wrong. For example, let's start with hair. Every guy thinks that blow drying their hair is damaging it or it's gonna burn it, but this is not true. As a matter of fact, in a study published in the National Library of Medicine, blow drying your hair after your shower actually causes less damage than towel drying, but only if you do it correctly. To do this right, grab a quality hairdryer. Now, the one that I've always used is the Leifin Essie High Speed Hair Dryer. I've showed this before, but pick whatever hairdryer you have and you wanna hold it about 15 centimeters away from your hair. Now, most men just keep the hairdryer in one spot until it dries, but you shouldn't do this. Keep that hairdryer moving consistently around your head and don't just focus in a spot, because if you keep the heat too long on your hair, the more likely you are to damage your hair, which is also why I used the Leifin Hair Dryer. It has a proprietary 105,000 RPM motor that dries your hair faster than anything else. So when you step out the shower, instead of damaging your hair like towel drying, which would cause it to come out, even if you have short hair like mine, you grab that Leifin and with that high speed motor, I can dry my hair in less than a minute and I'm ready to go. Next, let's move to grooming, which the most important thing that can affect your attractiveness is taking care of your teeth. Just how important are teeth? Well, according to this study, if you're not seeing that attractive, having bad teeth and bad breath will significantly make you attractive. Now, what they found here is the more attractive you become, if your teeth stay the same and they're yellow and you have bad breath, it increases the impact on how attractive you could potentially be. In other words, you taking care of your oral health is the most important thing you can do for your attractiveness. Now, to take care of your teeth, you have three options. You have a man in toothbrush, you have a vibrating toothbrush and you have an oscillating toothbrush. Most men don't know about that third option. Oscillating toothbrushes actually move the brush head up and down. In other words, it's not just vibrating, it's actually scrubbing your teeth. So as you brush your teeth, if you use something like this one, which is the Leifin oscillating toothbrush, it is doing around 60 strokes on your teeth per minute without you actually having to do any effort. This is why if you wanna maximize how much plaque and how much wider your teeth can get, getting an oscillating toothbrush is the best way to go. Now this Leifin toothbrush, people call it the apple of toothbrushes. When you see it, it looks extremely slick, but the technology behind it is the key here. This is what's gonna elevate your attractiveness. And finally, we have good skin. Now, to develop good skin, everybody just thinks about washing their face and doing the right skincare products. That's not gonna be enough, especially if you're laying your head down on pillows that are filled with bacteria. My recommendation, keep doing the skincare, but you must sleep on a clean pillow every night. So the best thing to do is grab a towel, lay it on your pillow right before you go to sleep. And that way every morning, you can just replace the towel. You don't have to be replacing your pillow sheets. And your face will have something clean to land on every single day, preventing bacteria to transfer and preventing acne to start. Look, I'm not just gonna hook you up with information. I'm gonna give you the tools that actually work to make you more attractive, the stuff that really matters. Grab the amazing Leifin Swift Essie hair dryer. Now, for a limited time offer with up to 30% off, I click the special link in the description box. I've never seen an offer like this before, so I'm sure it's just for the holidays. I would click the link down below, check them out. Number four, spiker serotonin by being a stalker. You're gonna spike a woman's strongest pair of bonding hormone, which is serotonin. You see, the more she produces this, the more she's gonna wanna be around you. So you're thinking, how do we trigger this? You see, a recent MIT study found that people are more likely to become very close friends. The closer that they live next to each other, what they found was that if someone just lived one door room away, they were 40% more likely to become best friends. Then if they lived four doorways away, where that likelihood drops all the way down to less than 10%. So you just by being physically closer to her at all times, you increase the chances of building a stronger connection with this girl. But here's the catch. This doesn't mean you're just gonna stand right next to her all the time. That's weird, bro. You're gonna be a creep here, all right? It's gonna work against you. So here's how you're gonna use that proximity or closeness to your advantage without being weird. First, whether you're at school or university, I want you to look at what clubs that she's in and you're gonna sign up for those clubs. If you're at work, ask around if people wanna do weekly drinks or meetups or coffee shops and then try to sit around her when you guys are out. Next, whether it's in class, at work, or in a lunchroom, try to find chances to sit near her whenever you can. The closer you are, the more likely you are to start triggering that serotonin bond. Finally, if you know exactly what she's into, use that to start building small conversations whenever you're near her. Maybe it's a hobby, a TV show, or something that you're both passionate about, that club you both join. Those frequent, small, casual interactions are gonna build upon each other and they're way more powerful than that random, once a month long conversation you're trying to have with her through texts. The five, you're gonna insult her to produce more dopamine. You can hypnotize a woman to love you by just making her produce more dopamine. One easy way to trigger dopamine is through playful teasing or flirty insults. These mild challenges create a sense of unpredictability and this is what sparks curiosity and excitement. But if you don't do it right, it's so easy to come off as a jerk. So here are five playful teasing messages or things you can say in front of her that won't cross the line. I'm putting them on screen here, screenshot these, save these in your notes. The next time it's applicable, I want you to drop one of these, I guarantee you, you're gonna get a giggle out of her. So by this point, scientifically speaking, if you did everything I just told you, this girl should be obsessed with you. You've made her release five of the most crucial hormones that spark love and bonding in her and because you triggered that, she's associating those feelings to you, bro. I just broke down love into science, into pure chemistry, we're in the lab cooking. But here's the thing, to truly make her love you, to make her obsessed with you, there's one final hormone. You must make her release. Stakes is to number six. You're gonna make her release oxytocin by being the nice guy. Be nice to women, but you don't wanna be the nice guy. If you can understand this difference, a study from 2020 revealed that when you do it correctly, oxytocin will be released abundantly. Now, the key difference between being nice to women and being the nice guy is to do these five bonding behaviors I'm about to show you, but do them in a relaxed way. Don't expect anything in return, you do that, bro, trust me. So here are the five things that will trigger oxytocin in any girl. Smile with eye contact. Now, if you're not comfortable making eye contact, focus in the middle of her eyebrows instead too. Do something nice without being asked or expecting anything in return. For example, if you know her already and you know she loves coffee, surprise her with a coffee at work or school. If you know you're gonna be with a group, offer to bring drinks, coffees or snacks for the whole crew. Three, match her breathing when you're talking to her. Subtly sink your breathing with hers by observing the rise and fall of her shoulders. Four, give up your seat. Whenever you see an elderly person or woman, give up your seat, especially when you're in public transportation. And five, be kind to everyone. Treat people around you, especially those that aren't seen as popular with respect and kindness when she sees this. Bro, I promise you, her body's gonna be filled with oxytocin because she's gonna know you're that guy. And now that you've listened to me and made her release all six of these hormones, this woman's gonna be in love with you, bro."

        "transcript": " Ignore every video you've ever watched on style. If you complete this one video, which is a complete style guide, you will know how to dress better forever. So, get started. Number one, there are four accessories every man should own. Wearing accessories is the easiest way to elevate your style. All you got to do is put on a ring, a necklace, and glasses and you look good, right? Wrong. You don't just want any accessory, you need to buy the right accessories that go with your personal style. So, here are four accessories every man needs that you've probably haven't thought about. First, the best accessory is the one you don't see. You see, every man needs a good cologne, but the one you should get, it all depends on what you do on a day-to-day basis. If you're in school, get something subtle that's not super overpowering for the classroom, something that's citrus or even aquatic. If you're at work or maybe even going on a date, here's where you should get something a little bit stronger, something with woody nose or spicy nose. Two, if your wrist are naked, your outfit is incomplete. You want to keep it minimal. You either want to wear a watch on your non-dominant hand or wear a simple cuff bracelet because these are inexpensive and either silver or gold. Three, if you're going to pick up a ring, pick up a statement ring. To me, some of the best ones are pinky rings and you can get ones with gemstone, especially gemstones that have a meaning, maybe your birth gemstone. And four, the most important accessory that you can get, it's the one that can change the shape of your face. Glasses. You don't know what glasses that you wear. The easiest trick, look at your eyebrows. If you have straight eyebrows like mine, buy angular glasses. If your eyebrows are more curved by circular glasses. I don't know if you just realized what just happened. I could have made an entire video just on what I just talked about. That's how much information just went by in 30 seconds. By the end of this video, you will have a complete style guide with all the information you'll ever need to dress better and look good. Next is number two, your winter staples have to change. I'm going to go over five winter pieces you should start wearing now and five winter pieces you shouldn't wear anymore. You should donate them or sell them. See with winter, most people just buy it once and they never re-upgrade their winter wardrobe. They just keep wearing the same thing over and over every winter. I'm going to help you out first. Last winter, you were probably wearing regular crew neck sweaters. Not anymore. This winter, I want you to wear fitted crew neck sweaters. These are more casual and they make you look smarter. Examples of these are quarter zip sweaters, polo sweaters, or even mock neck sweaters. Next, lax winter, you wore athletic fitted sweatpants. This winter, I want you to invest in relaxed sweatpants. Last winter, you would just wear regular sneakers. This winter, I want you to wear military boots, Chelsea boots, or Western boots. I'll give you an example. This winter, I picked up a brand new pair of Western Decovas boots. Yo, these have been talking to me like, get me, get me, get me. They've been on my wishes for the longest because they're not only comfortable, but they're also timeless. And I know I'm getting my money's worth here because they're made from premium exotic cow hide leather and they're handmade in a process that takes 200 steps. I'm a geek for this type of stuff because these are the type of things where you invest in once and because it's timeless, you don't have to spend money ever again. And just look at them, bro. You can't tell me this is not going to elevate your fits, especially if you're just used to wearing sneakers all the time. And on top of it, because it's winter, they're actually functional, right? They protect you against the snow and they're also warmer. Not to mention, you look taller, bro. Let's move on to the next one. Last winter, you were just wearing hoodies all the time. This winter, I want you to invest in oversized sweaters. You want these to be oversized and baggy. These are your comfortable sweaters. They look a little bit more formal than your traditional hoodie. You just want to make sure you get them in plain colors and with no visible logos. Look, if you upgrade your wardrobe for winter, tops or bottoms, at the end of the day, what you wear on your feet is what's going to make or break your outfit, especially in the winter. You want to get something that lasts. If you guys want to check out the Covas, which is what I just picked up, I'm going to have them linked down below the exact boots. These right here should be a staple in every man's wardrobe, especially for winter. Number three, match your style aesthetic for the right occasion. Your style aesthetic should match the specific occasion. So I'm going to give you three essential style aesthetics every man should have so you can stay versatile. The best aesthetic for a date is the old money aesthetic. On the top, just get any basic cable knit sweater. They come in various styles, whether it's a quarter zip, a polo or a regular crew knit. For the bottom, don't get shorts or jeans. Instead, use trousers or chinos and overall avoid anything baggy. If you're going out with friends, the Starboy aesthetic works best, especially on a night out. It's edgy. It radiates a mysterious vibe. And if all your boys are on the same page, bro, you can do a two and three man that night easy. If you stick to the Starboy to do it, it's easy. Start with a black or a white shirt as your base, then layer it with a black leather or denim jacket. For the bottom, go for dark color jeans, like black or gray. For the shoes, boots probably work best. And as for the entire fit, go for fitted or slim fit options. Now, if you're in school, the soft boy aesthetic is your best option. This look reflects a laid back lifestyle that that's just filled with like hobbies and excitement. The best part, it's easy to pull off and it's budget friendly. On the top, just wear oversized vintage sweaters. And then at the bottom, just buy any loose fitting pants, whether it's loose fit jeans, loose fit pants or loose fit chinos. That's it. Boys, at this point, you got the right accessories, every guy needs, you updated your winter fashion trends. And now you've paired the right style aesthetic to the right occasion. I'm telling you, this is the only video you'll ever need when it comes to style. And I got four more tips to give you a full guide so you can be the most stylish guy in 2025. Takes us to number four. These are the three shoes every man should have in their wardrobe. You don't need to have 10 to 15 pairs of shoes in order to be stylish. As a matter of fact, there's only three pairs of shoes you need in your wardrobe to keep your footwear covered. Look, take it from a guy that has over 100 pairs of shoes. I only wear three of them. First, you need a minimal sneaker. That's a solid color. This will be your go-to shoe you wear daily, especially when you want to keep your outfit relaxed. You don't want to think too much. So my top recommendations here stick to white, brown or black leather. They're classic. They're clean and they go with everything. Second, every guy needs a pair of boots. Boots are great because it's one step above sneakers. So they make you look a little bit dressier, but they're not as dressy as like basic leather shoes or loafers. And the best part is when you step into boots and you feel that extra two inches, bro, there is no better confidence boost that any other style piece can give you. It is the one shoe that is a must in every guy's wardrobe. The ones from Tkovas. Yo, I'm telling you, I was convincing myself this whole year like, yo, these shoes, y'all, they're comfortable. They feel so light on the feet compared to other boots. These guys did a fantastic job when it comes to value and it's all because it's handmade. When you put on a pair of handmade shoes, you'll see why those cheap shoes that you buy that are mass produced are so uncomfortable. These look classy. They look expensive. They're insanely affordable. It's your time to get yourself that gift, bro. It's Christmas time. You deserve it for 2025, bro. I'm telling you, if you need a good pair of boots, Tkovas is that one stop shop are Mexican handmade boots with a style that, bro, it's going to elevate any of your fits. If you guys want to check them out, they'll be linked down below. And the third style is shoot. Every man needs is a good dress shoot, whether it's a loafer or a lace up, because there's going to come a time where you're going to have to step up your style to be formal or maybe semi-formal. Number five, learn the rules on how to dress formally. Most guys think I'll just put on a shirt and dress pants and now I'm dressing formal. And that's why you end up dressing like this. Everybody knows a guy that dresses like this. See, when it comes to dressing formally, there's certain rules you can never break. So I'm going to give you a step by step guide on how to dress formally that next time you have a presentation, a wedding, or you just want to look good, follow this five step guide for pants, only stick to colors like beige, black, light gray, and navy. Then you're going to pair them with these exact shirt combinations. For beige pants, you can wear black, olive, white, or navy. For black pants, you can wear maroon, white, light gray, or brown. For light gray pants, you can wear blue, black, or dark brown. And for navy pants, you can wear white or light gray. Second, when you put on a dress shirt, I want you to use double sided tape underneath each collar tab to keep your collar in place and make yourself look crisp and clean. Third, your pants, they should never stack at the bottom. Rolling your pants up or trying to cuff them as if they're jeans, this is not going to work. It's just going to look sloppy. So you're going to have to take them to your tailor and get them hemmed professionally. Fourth, if the event is casual formal, you can wear sneakers. Just make sure that sneakers are made out of leather like a white or a black leather. And fifth, make sure your shirt remains tucked in place all day with the military top, whatever shirt you're wearing. You're going to grab the excess fabric on the sides and tuck it backwards as you tuck in your shirt. They gave yourself a tailored look that stays in place all day. Number six, skinny guys should follow these two rules. If you're a skinnier guy, there are two things you must know to start dressing better based on your proportions. The first thing is that you need to stick to wearing slim fit shirts and slim fit pants. On the average guy, this might look too tight, but for you, it's going to look perfect. And I know a lot of people think Jose, well, won't skinny clothes make you look skinnier? I should be wearing baggier stuff. Actually quite the opposite. Baggier clothes will emphasize your slender build, making you look skinny. The second rule you must follow is that instead of wearing dark colors, you need to be wearing lighter colors. Dark colors have a natural slimming effect, like your navy or your black, but lighter colors like white, tan, olive, or light blue has the opposite effect and it makes you look bigger. They basically add visual weight or thickness to your frame. And if you do this, bro, like I promised you in the beginning, this is the only style guy you'll ever need to start dressing better."

        "transcript": " Today, I'm gonna show you facts only the top 1% of men know. Because once you learn these, bro, life will become easy for you. All of us men, we all go through the same phases. You have the confidence phase, and then you have the mental phase. You have the crush phase. I'm gonna show you how to dominate all of that with facts most guys don't know. Let's move on to the confidence phase. This is where you start putting focus on building your body, having great skin, having great hair, basically the looks maxi phase where you're trying to make yourself look as good as possible. I'm gonna help you do that with number one, you should never lift heavy. I want you to guess which person has the better body. Meet Daniel. Daniel starts going to the gym. He sees big guys lifting heavy weights and they all have huge muscles. So he naturally assumes, yo, I gotta do the same. So every weight machine he goes on, he loads as much weight as possible and he struggles to do 4-6 reps. He doesn't care about form. All he cares about is that that weight is being moved. Then there's Jose. Instead of focusing on lifting heavy weights, he picks a moderate load. It sounds like an astute fellow. He focuses on doing 10-12 reps per set. His priority is building a strong mind to muscle connection. The dude sounds smart. He must read a lot of studies where he's consciously contracting each muscle with every rep. Now, who has the better body? You don't have to think about it, bro. Chances are Jose has the better body. He'll be leaner, he'll put on more muscle and he's gonna have a positive relationship with the gym. And if you don't pick your boy, then what are you doing, bro? Of course I'm gonna do it the right way. This takes us to number two. Getting clear skin is actually easy. See, having clear skin takes less than five minutes and it's gonna give you an insane boost of confidence and increase your chances of success with women. So here's your five minute routine. First, wash your hands. This is your number one rule. You do not wanna transfer any dirt or bacteria onto your skin. Next, you're gonna do a pre-wash with oil. You're gonna grab two drops of an oil cleanser onto your fingertips and then you're gonna massage that oil into your skin for about 45 seconds, working upwards. Once done, I want you to rinse thoroughly. Doing this will remove any excess oil production and dirt buildup that your skin has. As a matter of fact, I also recommend that you start adding more zinc and vitamin B6 into your diet as both of these are great oil production regulators to prevent your skin from overproducing oil as this is what clogs your pores and causes acne. Now is when you move on to the actual cleanser, a foam cleanser. Here, I want you to use a facial scrubber for this. You're gonna massage it into your face for around 30 seconds to a minute. Again, always working upwards against gravity. Once done, you're gonna rinse your face off and pat it dry with a clean towel. At this stage, you've done a great job cleansing the outside of your skin. If you wanna cleanse the inside of your skin, add more vitamin C to your diet. As vitamin C is a great support for cognitive production, which basically means you're gonna regenerate new skin while also fixing the color of your skin. After this step, you're gonna apply a toner. This takes about 30 seconds, so you're just gonna pat it across your face and finally, you're gonna apply a moisturizer that has sunblock or SPF protection. The moisturizer is gonna seal in all those good nutrients and keep the hydration close while also protecting you against the sun's heart rays. I also recommend you add more vitamin E to your diet. Most don't understand this, but vitamin E is great for your skin as it helps your skin maintain hydration throughout the day. All the vitamins I just talked about, you can buy them independently as bottles. I have. It's gonna cost you around $180, which is why I thought, this is ridiculous. It's expensive and you're only getting four benefits. So you know your boy had to step in and do something. This is why I formulated get attractive, our new supplement from Get Supplement that has 27 vitamins and minerals, including zinc, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E that are all scientifically proven to help your skin and your hair look as good as possible. As a matter of fact, you can click the link down below, go to our site and see all the studies and see how every vitamin is backed by science to help you look as attractive as possible. I basically put all of that in a singular pill where if you subscribe monthly, you get it for $28 instead of $180 between all the vitamins you would have to buy independently. Now it's only one pill. It's easier to take and you can stay consistent because that is key here. If you want these to work, if you want these vitamins to give you the clear skin you've always wanted, you have to be consistent. You have to take one every single day and never break. And I usually recommend you take it for about 60 days, which is why clicking the link down below and subscribing is the best deal. You get it for $28, which is the cheapest you'll find online and you can stay consistent. If you guys want to check out Get Attractive and level up over every other guy, I want you to click the link down below and check us out. Number three, women love these hairstyles on men. I compiled a list of six hairstyles that women find the most attractive on a guy. The first is the messy middle part. It's a laid back casual look that's stylish without trying too hard. The second is the French crop. It's clean. It's easy to maintain and it's modern with that texture at the top, keeping it low. Third is wavy long hair. This gives off that rugged creative vibe. It's much harder to maintain, but if you do have this style of hair, you should definitely rock it. Fourth is braids. Whether it's tight cord rows or looser styles, this shows that you're just bold, confident and it's always clean. The five is slick back. This is the top 1% guy. The guy that has money. And six is the buzz cut. Every guy should have one buzz cut at least once in their life. You'll either look insanely attractive or you'll look pretty bad, but it's going to build you a ton of confidence inside. You know more facts about life than 99% of other men, but there's still two more faces in your life that you're going to face off, which is the mental thing. And I want you to be prepared for it. With these three facts, you've never heard of. Number one, following these three habits will save your life. If you do these three habits every day, you will completely change your life. Number three, it's my favorite, but to get there, you have to complete habit one and two first. You're going to start waking up between the hours of five and seven a.m. I give you this range because waking up between any of these hours will give you a head start over every other guy that likes to sleep in. Second, you will make your bed in the morning. Not only is this going to jumpstart your motivation for the day, but it's also going to get your body moving, getting that blood flow early. And third, you're going to start habit stack. This is when you pair something you want to do with something that you have to do. An example of this is watching TikToks while you go on a walk or listening to music while you clean your room. Number two, apply the Goldilocks principle to you. If you cannot get things done, it's not because you're lazy. It's because you don't understand the Goldilocks principle. If you found it hard to stick with your habits, it's not a reflection of your capability or your potential. Often, it just comes down to doing the right of mount that feels manageable to you. The Goldilocks principle teaches us that we thrive when we find that just right level of challenge. Let me give you an example. For some, studying three hours, it could be effective, but if you find that you concentrate better around one to two hours, then that's your sweet spot. Similarly, if working out for an hour feels overwhelming to you, start working out for 20 to 30 minute sessions and then gradually build from there. That's your sweet spot. By focusing on that right amount for you, you're going to build the discipline necessary for the long term. This takes us to number three, never fail and lose progress. You will never fail again in your life if you learn what to do and not to do. First, do, learn from experiences. Don't blame others. Do, stay adaptable. Don't let it define you. Do, set realistic expectations. Don't compare yourself to others. Do, seek advice or support. Don't give up too soon. Do, keep moving forward. Don't be afraid to take risks. This takes us to the very last phase. This phase, this is when you start having a crush. You start wanting to date girls and eventually the long term relationships, but most men, they actually end up failing in this first stage. Which is why. Number one, you need to understand that your crush likes you if she does this. There are three things you need to know if your crush is actually into you. First, she'll save your snaps. If you're known, she's saving all your photos and messages on her snapchat. This is a strong indicator that she's into you. Second, she's going to become a mini-youth. Let me explain this. Women become literal clones of you if they like you. I'm laughing because I'm just thinking about it right now. It's so obvious, but most guys never see it. She'll start listening to the same music you listen to. She's going to start doing the same hobbies you do. She's even going to start talking the way you talk. I know this because it's happened multiple times and if you can't relate to this, probably a sign she's not into you. But third and lastly, she offers to pay. This can be something as simple as her just buying a snack off the vending machine and giving it to you. Or paying for your coffee. Most women will never do this, even for their own best friends. But for the boy they like, oh, she's going to make an exception. Again, these facts, guys don't know these facts, but only 1% of men know these. Stick to number two. Use the forbidden fruit effect to never get friendzoned again. Never getting friendzoned? That's easy. Getting girls to chase you, it's even easier. All you got to do is use dark manipulation time. Know as the forbidden fruit effect. What you're going to do is tell the girl that you're with that you can't see each other being a couple. And you can make it playful. And do stuff like, oh, you just played too much. I just can't take you seriously. This dark manipulation technique works because it falls into something called commodity theory. It suggests that the more something is perceived out of reach, the more valuable it is. I'm basically making you a diamond in her eyes because girls want what they can't have. And you're telling her we will never be a couple. Even if you're not an attractive guy, this works. Trust me. In fact, it might even drive her crazier that you're not a 10 out of 10 guy. She's used to 10 out of 10 guys hitting her up and you're not. That's going to drive her crazy. 3. Use the authority principle to get more dates. Never start questions with the girl with the word can. Women, they are attracted to men who are assertive and decisive. These are the type of men that know exactly what they want. And for you, you want her and you want to make it as clear as possible. And by you taking charge, you demonstrate that you're that leader, an assertive man. So instead of telling her, oh, can we talk later? You're going to say, let's catch up tomorrow at noon. Instead of saying, can we go out for dinner? I want you to say, we're going to this great Italian spot. I know. Instead of saying, can we see each other again? I want you to say, I'm taking you to this cool coffee shop next time. Bro, I promise you this. If you do this, your calendar will be booked with dates and all you're doing is not using the word can in your questions. Bro, the type of knowledge I'm giving you right now, it's the stuff that less than 1% of men know I shouldn't be giving you this to be honest with you. But now, just understanding if your crush likes, understanding the forbidden fruit effect to make yourself more valuable, and understanding the authority principle to get more dates. And you will never fail again. If you learn the facts that I just showed you in this video, keep them here and keep them here. Life is going to be easy for you."

        "transcript": " If you're watching this, it means you're probably having issues attracting girls. But this is not because you're not 6'6 with the 6 figure income in 6 pack abs. It's because you don't understand how women work. So, you're a 10 choose about women. Men learn too late in life. Starting with number one, girls will never tell you what they want. So I'm gonna decipher them for you. If a girl ever says any of these things to you, this is actually what she means. If she says, I want a guy that's 6 feet. What she actually means is that she just wants a guy that's taller than her, even if it's by an inch. If she says, oh, I'm not looking for a relationship right now. What she actually is saying is that she's not interested in you. If she says, I want a guy that makes a lot of money. What she's actually saying is that she wants a guy who has the ability or potential to make a lot of money. If she says, I don't want to ruin our friendship. What she's actually saying is that she doesn't see you as a potential partner to date. If she says, you have nothing to worry about, he's just a friend. What she's actually saying is that you have actually something to worry about, bro. And just like that, I've cleared the air showing you five things almost every girl will tell you once in your life and what it actually means. And you need to learn this now before you're too late. Because that's how you end up getting played. That's why you can't get girls. But I'm not stopping there. I have nine more hard truths I need to show you about women that almost every guy learns too late. Number two, most women will think you're ugly. Look, most women will find you unattractive. This is not your older brother telling you this. This is actual science and data. According to the National Library of Medicine, in six different studies, they were conducted amongst 1,200 different participants and they all pinpointed into the same direction. People tend to overestimate their attractiveness. The reason is because of something called blind spots where you don't even know where your flaws are until it's too late. This is also what causes a lot of men to start their self-improvement journey in the first place. You ask a girl out because you're thinking, I'm that guy and what happens? You get rejected. Now your eyes open up to these blind spots, these flaws you didn't even know you had and you get to work. I know this resonates to you because this is exactly what happened to me. This is why I built this entire community of men to try to become better. I'm trying to open your blind spots before a girl does. Look, self-improvement can take you up to a five or six in the attractiveness skill. But if you want to maintain that long term and continue to get better, six, seven or be an eight out of ten, you need to surround yourself around other men that can keep you up. Not your regular friend group that's keeping you a three. Boys, this is why I started the Institute. What I consider to be the greatest community on earth for men to look and feel better and connect and network with other men that have the exact same mentality. When you're around those men, you're unstoppable because your entire day revolves around the idea of how do I become better and every aspect of my life. Look, we are crushing it inside the Institute. We're looking out for each other. I'm in there every day, helping guys out with their dating problems, with their business problems, but more importantly, helping them out as a brother. If somebody in our community needs help, all of us band together to help that guy out, whether it's financially or with advice. I want you to join our brotherhood and become a member of the strongest brotherhood online for men right now by clicking the link down below because I want to have your back. I want to make sure you continue to level up for the rest of your life. If you guys want to join the Institute, we opened up a few slots for this month. We want to grow the brotherhood. I want you to come inside with us. If you guys want to check it out, it'll be linked down below. Three, your girl best friend doesn't want. If you're friends with a girl for more than a week, you're cooked. She doesn't like you, bro. Let me paint a picture for you. Take my friend, Tom and Chad. Tom has been friends with the girl he likes for three months. Let's call this girl Sabrina. Tom has been doing everything in his power to get Sabrina to like her, find her gifts, sending her paragraph messages every morning, trying to talk to her every day, but she still is not showing signs of interest in him. Now there's Chad. Chad just met Sabrina for the first time at a house party. At the party, Chad gets Sabrina's phone number. They immediately start flirting with each other that night. They were a little bit tipsy. They're sending messages back and forth and they make plans to meet up that weekend. Do you understand now? Don't? Not only. The Chad gets signals from Sabrina almost immediately that there was interest, but they were already making plans to hang out and it hasn't even been a week of knowing each other. Girls will make it super easy for guys that they like. So if you're friends with a girl for more than a week, you're cooked, bro. It's over for you. She just wants to be friends with you for attention and nothing more. Look, at this point, I opened your eyes about truths on women that most men will never learn or learn way too late. But I'm just getting started. I'm just getting one done. I got seven more. Number four, never date a woman that doesn't have these three green flags. Everyone is always obsessed with red flags, but no one talks about green flags. I'm going to show you three green flags you need to see in a woman before you make the decision to date them. Green flag one, she talks good about her ex. I know what you're thinking, but hear me out. A good woman will never talk bad about their ex and bash their name because they only usually do that to avoid accountability and push all the blame onto them. So if she's doing this, especially if she's doing this with multiple exes, she's the problem. She's never changing her way. Green flag number two, she always praises you when you do something good. A good woman will celebrate your wins with you and push you to keep winning. This is what I experienced with my wife when I was dating her and I knew it instantly. I'm going to marry this girl. Now, ever hear words like you would have never gotten there if it wasn't for me? Run immediately. Green flag three, she always trusts you. A woman who doesn't question everything you do, it makes you feel powerful as a man, especially if she's never accusing you of cheating. If a girl is not constantly nagging you, who are you talking to or what bro are you going to hang out with? She's the one. Five, attractive women will never hold eye contact with you. If a woman can hold eye contact with you, it means you're unattractive. Eye contact is a very masculine and dominant trait that often makes women feel uncomfortable. If you're having a conversation with a girl and you're noticing that she's not blushing, she's not trying to look away, or she's not smiling, chances are she feels very comfortable right now. She doesn't find you attractive and she's not that into you. Six, women know how to take advantage of weak men. Women are just good at sucking you dry. That's not it off, but I need you to get your head out the gutter. I know where you were going with this. That's not what I'm talking about. Before you switch tabs to go into one of those naughty pages, stick with me. This is important. What I do know is this. Women will take advantage of weak men at every opportunity they get. This starts from the very moment you meet her all throughout the time you spend with her. See, if you approach a girl at a nice restaurant or a nice lounge, she's going to immediately associate you with high status. In her mind, she's already thinking, this guy can provide for me. This is terrible because she's going to carry the same mentality throughout your entire relationship, which is why I recommend meet girls at more wholesome places, festivals, school library, coffee shops. Because here, your chances of meeting a woman that has the mentality of sucking you dry will drastically diminish. And you know exactly what I'm talking about, bro. Stop thinking about that. I know where you want to go, but stick with me here. Because so far, I've already helped you understand what women truly mean when they say certain things. I've shown you that most women, they think you're unattractive. I've shown you that your girl best friend, she doesn't want you. I've showed you that you should never date a girl that doesn't have three green flags. I've also showed you that if a girl keeps eye contact with you, it's a sign you're not that attractive. Finally, I've showed you that a woman will take advantage of your weakness. All of these, you will have learned too late after you've been rejected. I don't want that to happen to you. I want you to learn this stuff from me first, so you can go out into the world and date whatever girl you want and have a truly happy relationship. And to do that, there's still three hard truths that I need all of you to understand and remember for the rest of your life. 7. Women will only vide with certain types of guys. Women like to vibe with guys that have feminine energy. Women will tell you to be masculine and dominant, but they'll never tell you to be feminine. They're actually wrong because you need a mix of both. If you ever hear a girl compliment you and say, I like your vibe, what she's referring to is your feminine energy. This is when you learn to act more calm and relaxed around women and not so macho and alpha like you have something to prove. You being more relaxed, more flowy, that's what makes her feel so connected with you. It makes it easier for her to want to spend time with you. By the way, this gem that I'm teaching you right now, I picked up from one of the guys inside the community. I'm telling you, there's hundreds of like-minded men like myself and other men that just want to get better in dating and style and self-improvement and business. And we're all helping each other. And when I saw this guy share this advice with the other members, I thought, yo, I gotta share it with you guys. But this is what you're missing when you're not part of a family of a brotherhood that actually cares for you, that looks out for you and has your back. I want to have your back. I want you to join our brotherhood, the Institute, by clicking the link down below and reserving a spot today. Hey, most girls, think you're creepy. If you've ever tried talking to a girl and it seems like she's not even giving you a chance, it is most likely because she thinks that you're creepy. And being labeled a creep is not a terrible thing. It just means that you're someone that makes situations feel out of place. I'm going to fix that for you. The changes you have to make are simple. Anyone can fix themselves from being a creep. You just have to understand what you should do and do not do when you're in front of a girl. Don't avoid direct eye contact and fidget with your hands when you're talking to her. Do keep your hands at your sides and look at her eyes or in between her nose. Don't just stay awkwardly in a group conversation without saying anything. Do contribute to the conversation by saying something like, ask me a question about what's being said or making a joke. Don't wear designer clothing. Dude, dress yourself with minimal and classic pieces that always make you look put together. Remember, women cannot handle these phrases. The girl you want gets mad at you because you say these things. Girls for the most part can be confusing. But there are certain things that you should never say to a girl with the last one. I'm pretty sure gets most of it. First, you're overreacting. Never say that to a girl. Second, you're wearing that, bro. Immediate offense. Third, I can't do anything right. You're just signaling to her you're incompetent. Fourth, is it the time of the month again? Bro, if it is, you just triggered her. And five, why are you so sensitive? Even if she is sensitive, this is one way ticket to death. Women are flowers. You telling her this doesn't make it better. If you say any of these five things, of course she's gonna hate. Stand. Women appreciate shivery. Women love when guys do nice things for them. But you should only do the ones that don't make you look like a simp. Being a gentleman doesn't only apply to scenarios like a fancy dinner or a date. These are things that you can do as a modern gentleman that apply at any time and with any girl you meet, even if you just met her, that will make her obsessed with you. Here are five gentlemen rules I think all of you should follow. First, never let a girl walk on the outside of a sidewalk. Second, always open every door for her. Third, tying her shoes when they're undone. Fourth, offering your sweater to her whenever it's cold or it's rainy. And fifth, tucking her hair back whenever it's in her face. If you listen to me and apply these 10 hard truths into your life, I promise you your dating life will be a breeze. Because most men don't learn these till it's way too late."

        "transcript": " For men, hair loss starts as soon as you turn 18. The problem is most men don't know how to prevent this. So today, I'm going to show you six ways how you can fix your hair. Now, before I even show you any of this, you need to understand this concept or none of this will make sense. 90% of your hair loss is because of something called DHT. DHT is a hormone that comes from testosterone and it plays a role at deepening your voice, building muscle through puberty. But as you age, your DHT weakens and it shrinks your hair follicles, which is what leads to hair loss. So now that you understand this, our enemy is DHT. And in today's video, I'm going to break it down into two parts. First, I'm going to show you three ways to make your body stop producing DHT. And then I'm going to show you three ways so you can block DHT from binding to your hair follicles. One, you're going to reduce hair loss with products you already have in your kitchen. Everyone's using minoxidil to stop hair loss, but you have something just as powerful right in your kitchen. You see the key to reducing the DHT, which is responsible for hair loss in your body, is decreasing the amount of information in your scalp, which is what forces the production of DHT. For many guys, this might seem complicated, actually quite simple. And you can do it at home with an ingredient you probably already own. In a recent study, researchers took a group of 76 men and put them into two groups. One group consumed an edible oil every day. Let's call that Edible Oil A. The second group consumed a different edible oil. Let's call that Edible Oil B. After 24 weeks, the researchers analyzed the growth, thickness, and numbers of hairs on each guy's scalp. The results, the group that consumed Edible Oil A, saw a drastic 40% increase in the amount of hair on their head, while the group that consumed Edible Oil B only saw a 10% increase. The key takeaway here is that Oil A, which was pumpkin seed oil, is a fantastic DHT blocker. So you can grow thicker hair. So here's what you're gonna do. I want you to go to your drawer and grab an edible oil. Obviously, you can use olive oil and coconut oil, but according to study, the best one will be pumpkin oil. You're gonna take a tablespoon of this pumpkin oil or whatever edible oil you have, and then you're gonna massage it into your scalp for about 20 minutes right before you take a shower. Once the time is up, hop in the shower and shampoo all the oil as you normally would. Just doing this, you will see a massive improvement in the health and thickness of your hair, because according to the study, the oil can increase it by 40% and it was free. I'm gonna show you five more ways to fix your hair. Two, you're gonna use the right shower for your hair type. You see, the temperature in your shower can either increase or decrease your DHT production, which is the hormone responsible for hair loss, but it's not as simple as just using hot or cold water. Now, there is an ideal temperature for each hair type. So, I'm gonna show you how to test your hair type to see what hair type you have and then what temperature you should use for your hair type. First, I want you to grab a glass of water, then grab a brush and grab just one strand of hair. You're gonna place that strand of hair in your glass of water. If your hair floats like mine does and it doesn't sink, that means you have fine or dry hair. If it sinks slowly and then just floats around the middle of the cup, it means you have normal hair. But if you notice your hair goes straight to the bottom and just sinks to the bottom, it means you have oily hair. Now, if you have fine or dry hair, you wanna keep your water temperature between 85 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 and 33 degrees Celsius. The easiest way to do this is with a thermometer. You only have to do this once, set the water temperature, take a temperature of your water and then with the permanent marker, you can mark exactly where that temperature is. So, every time you hop in the shower, you get the right temperature. If you have normal hair, your temperature should be between 90 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit or between 33 and 36 degrees Celsius. Finally, for oily hair, you could actually go hotter. You can be anywhere between 95 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or between 36 and 39 degrees Celsius. This helps manage all that over-oil production effectively without increasing the HD production. Number three, your shampoo is making your hair fall out. See, when it comes to shampoo, here's everything it should and should not contain on the ingredient list to stop DHT production, the hormone responsible for your hair loss. It should contain flaxseed. These are natural DHT inhibitors that help control inflammation on your scalp. It shouldn't contain sulfates as they naturally strip away your oils. This is what leads to dryness and potentially worsening your scalp inflammation. It should contain biotin, which nourishes and strengthens the scalp while supporting healthy hair growth. It shouldn't contain a supropanol as it dries up the scalp and weakens hair follicles over time. Look, tracking all of that can be somewhat difficult. That's why taking a hair growth formula like the one from Groplex is so essential. This has everything you need, including the biotin I just mentioned. Within seven months of you taking this stuff, you will start noticing substantial hair growth. And that's not just my experience telling you that. That's actual reviews. 81% of their customers after seven months of taking this stuff have seen their hair become stronger. It should also contain something called saw palmetto, as this is a well-known natural DHT inhibitor that can help slow down hair thinning. It shouldn't contain sodium chloride, as this is a well-known thickening agent that dries out your scalp and makes your hair brittle. It should also contain buckwheat root, which can inhibit the conversion of the testosterone into DHT, helping reduce hair loss. It shouldn't contain diethanolamine as it damages your natural keratin, weakening your hair follicles and causing hair thinning. If all of that sounds too complicated for you, just use what I use, bro. I use the Viterform Hair Growth formula from Groplex. It's menatsudo, which you know scientifically words, but it also has a ton of natural DHT blocking ingredients. Some of which, like the ones I'm just mentioning, and the easy part is, you just have to do two pumps at the top of your scalp. I do this every night. I massage it in and go to sleep. I'm telling you, I'm going to keep my hair for the rest of my life because of this stuff. And it's not just my words saying this. 81% of their customers saw significant hair growth from just using this for seven months. This is a man's smartest decision buying this stuff. And finally, your product sure contained keto-corazole for its DHT blocking property, which promote hair growth. It shouldn't contain formaldehyde as overexposure to this chemical can irritate the scalp and knee to hair loss. Now, if you're like me and you want to save the time of not having to read all these singer ingredients and all your hair products, listen to your older brother. I did the hard work for you, so you don't have to. All you got to do is look good. If you guys want to check out VitaForm, which has all the ingredients I just mentioned that are good for blocking DHT, plus Minato, though, which has been scientifically proven to regrow your hair, click the link down below. You're going to find it at the lowest price possible right now. They're running their Black Friday sale. This is the time that you want to stock up on this stuff to actually save your hair. Now, by this point, we have now reduced the amount of DHT your body is producing by applying pumpkin oil, by using the right shower temperature, and now by using the right ingredients in your hair products. However, some DHT will still be produced. You won't block all of it. So now I got to show you three ways to prevent whatever DHT you have from binding to your hair fall. Number four, eat these five foods to stop your hair loss. Look, when it comes to hair loss and fixing your hair, everybody focuses on what products you're applying to the top of your head. But nobody thinks about what you put inside of your body, which is just as important. So I'm going to keep it straightforward with you. Here is a list of top five foods you should be eating to block DHT, which is what causes your hair loss and strengthen your hair. The first one, it's green tea. This contains EGCG, which is a natural DHT blocker, and it also stimulates hair growth. Now, you can replace your morning coffee with green tea, or you could do what I do. Grab a bottle of water, drop a green tea bag in it, and just sip on that water all day. I also like to combine it with my Complex 10 Hair Growth Supplement. This supplement contains green tea extract, which contains that EGCG that's in the green tea bags as well. And it's the same brand that I used for my Minoxidil that I was just showing you in the bathroom. The next one, it's coconut. See, the loric acid found in coconut oil is a proven DHT blocker. And the easiest way to consume this daily is through coconut water. I drink one of these a day. Next are onions, which are rich in Corsetin. Corsetin inhibits DHT by preventing testosterone to transform over to DHT. So, whenever you're at Chipotle, ask for extra onions. Next, it's turmeric, which contains curcumin, which can lower DHT by blocking the enzyme that creates it. And finally, it's pumpkin seeds, which are packed with zinc, which is known to block DHT. All of these are natural, and you should enrich your diet with these to stop your hair loss. And if you want to make it as simple as possible, every ingredient I just showed you is also a GrowPlexus complex 10 hair growth supplement. If you combine this with their vitafal, and you do this daily, bro, I just fixed all your hair problems, and it's going to be way cheaper than all these ingredients, because right now they're running a Black Friday sale. If I were you, I'd click the link down below, check it out. This is the best price you're ever going to get, and you're going to save your hair. Number five, use this scalp exfoliant to grow more hair. Boys, do not just exfoliate your face, exfoliate your scalp as well, and you'll never deal with hair loss again. This is because recent studies have found that exfoliating your scalp is crucial for blocking DHT, the hormone responsible for our hair loss. So I'm going to show you how to do a homemade hair scrub that you can do from your kitchen. First, you need to buy some activated charcoal powder. You can get this at your local store or on Amazon. Next, you will mix the charcoal with one tablespoon of lemon juice. You're going to blend it together until you have a thick paste-like texture. Then, apply it to your scalp, massaging it similar to what you would do with shampoo. For best results, it's better if you do it on wet hair and massage is better, and you want to let it sit for 10 minutes. Then you just wash it out. If you start doing this at least once a week, you're going to unclog your pores and your hair follicles, and also decrease the amount of DHT your hair scalp is producing, making your hair grow thicker and fuller. Number six, make your hair grow faster by using this massage technique. Here is how you're going to massage your head for hair regrowth and also to block the hormone that's causing your hair loss, which is DHT. During a recent study, researchers found that when you use a specific massage technique, participants saw a 75% increase in hair growth and hair density, and here's how you're going to do it. First, you can do this on dry hair or you can apply a small amount of edible oil to make it easier. Then, just using your fingertips, you're going to gently apply circular motions, going both clockwise and counterclockwise. You're going to cover your whole scalp, but you're going to focus on areas where hair thinning is the most common in men, which is your temples, your crown, and your hairline. You want to perform this massage for about 10 minutes in the morning. You can do this while you shower and then 10 minutes at night. You want to make sure that you do this daily, and after a while, you're going to see significant results, because the more you do this, the more blood flow you increase in nutrients to get delivered to your hair scalp, which prevents the DHT production and helps your hair grow faster. If you do this, plus all the other tips I just showed you in this video, you'll not only stop the DHT production, you're going to block it and finally fix your hair."

        "transcript": " If I was starting a wardrobe from scratch, I could build the best wardrobe in the game. So today, I'm gonna show you that if I was rebuilding my wardrobe from scratch, this is exactly what I would buy. First, you need to use the right foundation. Stop washing your clothes. I'm gonna show you three simple steps on how to correctly take care of your clothes. First, you need to invest in wooden hangers. They will help maintain the silhouette of your tops while also absorbing any moisture inside your closet to keep your shirts fresh. Oh, but Jose, I still have to wash my clothes or it's gonna stink. No, bro, stick with me here. Second, you need to buy a steamer. Anytime your clothes has wrinkles and you need to get rid of them fast, this will get it done. Plus, the steam is gonna kill 99.9% of bacteria on your clothing, keeping it fresh and making it smell good. Stick with me here. We're still not washing your clothes, bro. And if your girl or your mom are complaining, you have them watch this video. The third step is, you're still not gonna wash your clothes after every use. If it's a shirt, you can wash it after every three to five wears. If it's jeans, you can wash it after every 10 wears. As a matter of fact, the CEO of Levi's doesn't even wash them. And if it's a jacket or sweaters, you wanna dry clean these every two months. Now, your new wardrobe is gonna last you 10 times longer and you don't have to be rebuying clothing because it's not gonna deteriorate as fast. Taking care of your clothes is the right foundation, is where it all begins. If you do this wrong, whatever you buy, will always look bad. But now, we get into the good stuff. I'm gonna show you step by step how you're gonna build your perfect wardrobe in six steps. Number two, you're only gonna buy clothes that increases your confidence. I need you to take this style test to know what clothing pieces will give you the most confidence. Here's the thing, all of you know how to choose the right pieces. You just don't realize it yet. What everyone else tells you is, oh, just scroll on Pinterest and Instagram to find new inspiration. This is wrong, bro. Just think about it. It's never really worked for you. These platforms always show posed, heavily-edited photos on model-like guys, so they create unrealistic expectations. When you buy the pieces, they just never look good on you. Instead, I always recommend TikTok and Reels. This way, you can get a real, natural look on how the clothes flows and fits on a person. On either platform, I want you to bookmark 10 to 15 of your favorite outfits. Then, once you have it bookmarked, I want you to zoom out and look at all of them and look for similarities, like the same type of pants or the same type of jacket or the same type of colors. For me, I kept seeing this style of pant come up. I also kept seeing this style of jacket. Not to mention that style of shirt, wearing like five of my posts. You wanna know why this happens? It's because the clothes that you wear affects how you think and how you behave. This is called enclosed cognition. Your brain understands this connection and subconsciously gravitates towards clothing that elevates your confidence and aligns with your personality. This is why I said, most of you know how to pick the right pieces. I'll give a great example. I also noticed, most of the outfits I chose, every guy was always wearing a jacket. Therefore, I know that's the type of style that's gonna elevate my confidence. That's why for fall and winter, bro, I wouldn't a whole shopping's free for jackets. Once I realized, this is what makes me feel the most confident. Number three, don't buy these, buy these instead. Now that you know what pieces to buy that fit your style, I need to show you which ones within that category you should and shouldn't buy. So, I'm gonna need you to stop buying these clothing items and buy these instead. Instead of cheap tank tops, buy compression tank tops. They maintain their shape over time and they give you a slimming effect. Instead of buying and wearing basic t-shirts everywhere, invest in ribbed sweaters. They're just as easy to wear and they look classy. Instead of buying a basic bomber jacket, buy a varsity jacket instead. This that you see here, I just picked it up from the jacket maker. It's a Pascal Green varsity jacket. Yo, when I saw this color, I told you, I'm obsessed with jackets, but especially for fall and winter, I had to pick up. And this one is from a brand called Jacket Maker. Now, there's a lot of cool jackets out in the market, but what I like about Jacket Maker, they not only have high quality leather jackets at crazy affordable prices, but you can also input your own body measurements. So it's one of the only companies that I know of where you can get a leather jacket that's made for your body shape. So whether you're overweight, super skinny, or super athletic, you can find a jacket that fits your body perfectly. This to me was game changing. So when I said I went on a shopping spree with jackets, bro, these are all the jacket maker jackets I got, like this Aaron G1 leather bomber jacket, bro, I look like a fire pilot in this thing, yo. Look, if you guys wanna check out any of the jackets that I'm wearing here, I'm actually gonna have the five that I picked up for this fall, winter, link down below. With the special code, it's gonna make it even more affordable. Right now that months are getting colder, this is the best spot to pick up jackets. Instead of buying chinos, buy wool pants with a straight cut. Instead of buying v-neck shirts or sweaters, buy quarter zip sweaters. They're super classy and they're gonna make you stand out from the other guys. Instead of buying a basic denim jacket, invest in a suede jacket. This to me is such a power move because denim jackets are great, but you can only wear them casually. With a suede jacket, you can wear casually and dress it up. This one also is from the jacket maker. And like I said, one of the reasons I love this brand because they have so many styles from leather biker jackets to this suede trucker, to the pilot jacket, to the varsity jacket. And all of them I ordered for my body type. So it doesn't matter what body type you are, you can find the right style and the right size for you. And I've never seen any other jacket company do that. If you guys wanna check out jacket maker, yo, I'm gonna link them down below. If you want them as a gift, I would ask your wife, your girl, your mom, your parents for this, because I'm also adding a discount code that's gonna make the jackets crazy affordable. And remember, this is high quality 100% leather. You're not getting any fake stuff. Just look at it, look, curious this stuff looks. When you're rebuilding a wardrobe, these are the type of pieces you want that are gonna last a lifetime. And finally, instead of buying skinny jeans, I want you to buy straight cut jeans. Number four, pick up the four shoes every man needs to own. You only need four pairs of shoes in your rotation. Look, over the years, I've owned every single footwear you can think of. As a matter of fact, this is a shoe collection video. I think I had over 100 pairs of shoes in that video. I'm telling you right now, there's only four types of shoes you need. Everything else is a waste of time and money. The first pair is something for everyday use. These are shoes that have a medium to thick sole for comfort. So these could be like your new balances or your ASICs. The next shoe is something minimum. This is when you want something that's a little bit more formal, but not over the top. For my bros that know me, you know I love a plain white leather shoe here. They go together with any outfit you can think of. And the best part is that they're timeless and they'll always be in style. So here, old school vans, converses, or even Thursdays are a great option. The third pair are dressy leather shoes. Now, my favorite pairs are leather lace-ups, Chelsea boots, or loafers. And if you go with either of these, try to find ones that have a thick sole. A lot of these dress shoes do, and it'll give you extra height. And the fourth pair is what I call something special. These are gonna be your streetwear shoes. Now, because you only have four pairs, I would stay away from anything that has a lot of color. So stick to your Jordan ones, your Nike dunks, or even your Jordan fours. By this point, you've learned how to take care of your clothes. The right foundation. You've found how to pick your signature pieces that give you confidence. You understand what you should and should not buy. And now, you understand that you only need four shoes and then your entire wardrobe rotation. But there's still three more things we need to do to fully build a perfect wardrobe from scratch. The five. Buy pants that match your body type. How many times do you buy pants and they just don't fit right? They're either too tight on the thigh or too tight on the waist. Bro, the problem is you're not buying pants for your body type. So I'm gonna make it as simple as possible for you. First, I'm gonna show you what your body type is and then I'm gonna show you what pants you should wear for your specific body type. You first need to understand that there's three basic body types. You have your rectangle, you have your pair, and you have your circular. So you're gonna grab a tape measure and you're gonna take three measurements. If you don't have a tape measure, you can use an iPhone cable to guesstimate. The first measurement is your waist. It starts at the narrowest part of your torso, so it's about an inch above your belly button. The second measurement is your hips, which is the fullest part of your rear end. And your third measurement is your inseam, which starts at the top of your crotch and goes all the way down to your ankle. If your waist and your hips are nearly the same size, this means you're a rectangular shape, which means that a straight leg, a boot cut, or even baggy pants will look great on your athletic frame. If your hips are wider than your waist, it means you're a pear shape. For you, I want you to opt for high-waisted pants or jeans to give you a slimmer look and also opt for pants that have elastane or a stretch in them so they don't sit skin tight, especially around the waist. Now, if your waist is wider than your hips, it means you're a round or circular shape. For you, you should wear mid-rise jeans or even relaxed leg styles. This is gonna elongate your silhouette and making you look less round. Number six, understand how color theory works. You need to stop wearing black and learn how to add color to your outfit correctly. Look, it's complicated to understand, I get it, but I made it super simple for you to do it. Here's how you can add color to your outfit in three easy levels. Level one is what I call beginner balancing. This one, you're gonna pick one color and wear it across your entire outfit. We call this monochromatic, but there's one rule you have to follow. As you can see, I'm wearing all green. However, I'm not wearing the same shade of green. You never wanna wear the same shade or even same texture, which is why on top I have my jacket maker, suede varsity jacket. I'm sorry I keep wearing this, bro, but I'm not taking this off all foreign winter. And then at the bottom, I paired it with a different color of green that's also a different fabric. Level two is what I call intermediate balancing. For this level, grab any color you want on the color wheel and you're gonna pair it with one neutral color. Because neutral colors are muted in the lack saturation, you can easily pair it with any color you want. The best way to pull this off, wear neutral color pants like gray, tan, or black, and then opt for a bold color top, whatever you want. Now, level three is what I call expert balancing. This is the highest level you should go to where you're gonna mix three colors in your outfit. Any more than mixing three colors, in my opinion, it's just overkill. From the color wheel, I want you to pick two colors that are right next to each other. And you're gonna combine those two colors with one neutral color. For example, here, I'm wearing a green jacket, a blue shirt, and black jeans. I'm telling you boys, adding color is easy. And for me, I like to add it with my jacket because it's just so easy to pop up on any outfit. And if you want this suede jacket or any of the ones that I've been showing you, check out Jack and Maker and do it now because they're running a Black Friday sale, bro. You're gonna get these at a cheaper price than when I got them because they have an insane discount going on right now. Go check out Jack and Maker. You're gonna level up any outfit you're gonna put on. Number seven, don't look at the brand. Luxury is garbage if you don't understand fabrics first. Fabrics, they matter way more than the brand label. So here's what fabrics you should and shouldn't wear. For shirts, always go for 100% cotton or even cotton blends such as bamboo. These fabrics are soft, they are breathable, they're gonna keep you cool all day. What you wanna avoid is any shirt that has a mix of polyester or 100% polyester because these trap heat and they're gonna be uncomfortable to wear. For sweaters, look for any that contain wool. The best type of wool is cashmere which is significantly warmer and lighter than traditional wool. What you wanna stay away from is any sweater that's woven with acrylic yarn as these start to peel faster and they don't insulate or keep you as warm during the winter. For jeans, make sure that it has 90% or more cotton, high cotton content ensures durability and also more comfort throughout the day. What you wanna avoid is any sort of synthetic blends as these break down faster and they're also very warm and hot when you wear them. As for hoodies, you wanna stick to cotton fleece for extra comfort. You wanna avoid is polyester fleece. These tend to peel fast and also are extremely hot and uncomfortable when you wear them. By focusing on fabric over brand, you're gonna actually invest in quality pieces that last long and make you look great. But if you listen to me and follow all seven steps I just showed you, you're gonna be able to rebuild an amazing wardrobe on a budget to always look amazing."

        "transcript": " For every 10 men, only six will make a New Year's resolution. Out of those six, one is gonna quit by the end of that first week. Two more are gonna quit by the end of January. And then throughout the year, two more will drop out. That leaves just one man out of every 10 guys who sticks to their New Year's resolution. Why? Well, because that one man probably knows the most common mistakes that are causing you to quit your New Year's resolution. And that's why he makes it to the end. So today, I'm gonna make sure you're that guy. I'm gonna walk you through five New Year's resolutions. Every man should have this New Year. I'm gonna explain why most men will fail them and then I'm gonna show you how to succeed at them. If you make it to the end of this video, you're gonna have an exact list of resolutions and a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish them in 2025. Let's start with resolution number one, get six back abs. If you're overweight, 2025 will be the best year of your life. I'm gonna show you how to finally get shredded. Every year you make the same promise. This year I'm gonna finally get ripped and you don't. This is what's called false hope syndrome. It happens when beginners just dream about the results and then expect change to happen overnight. But when they don't see those immediate results, they quickly burn out. You can easily avoid this trap and actually get ripped using the Kaizen method. The Kaizen method, it focuses on achieving small, easy to complete improvements every single day, the compound into bigger results. So here's how you're gonna finally get ripped in 2025. First, do not commit to working out six days a week right away. Instead, I want you to start small. Work out once a week in January, twice a week in February and keep adding one day each month until you're working out five times a week, no more, no less. Next, don't commit to trying to walk 10,000 steps every day. Instead, commit to walking 1,000 steps every day in January. Then add 1,000 steps every month until you reach 10,000 steps a day. And finally, do not focus on the small muscles like your biceps, your triceps or your calves when you're starting to work out. Instead, prioritize the big ones like your chest, your back, your legs. I want you to rotate between these muscle groups, whether you're working out once a week or multiple times a week. By this point, you've replaced Fossil syndrome to finally get shredded in 2025. But to be everything you want to be, you're gonna need more than just an amazing body. This is why you need the rest of the video because I got four more New Year's resolutions I want you to have. And I'm gonna show you how to complete them just as easily. Resolution number two, we're gonna glow up. You wake up every morning, you look at yourself in the mirror and boom, you got pimples, acne is popping up. But for you, 2025 will be different. Just imagine you waking up with clear, perfect skin, all just using three simple products. A cleanser, a moisturizer and an SPF sunblock. But wait a second, there's a catch. Most of you probably use these already, but you're not checking the ingredient list on these products, which is why they're not working for you. What you want is a cleanser that has psilocylic acid. I always talk about this one, this is the one that I've been using for five years. This is from Geology. Unlike sodium loyal sulfate, psilocylic acid is oil soluble, which means it penetrates deeper into your pores to clean them thoroughly without leaving your skin overly dry or red. Therefore, when you use the correct facial cleanser, like the one from Geology, you not only keep your skin acne free, but you also keep your skin healthy and hydrated. Look, I've been using this for five years for a reason, it is not just myself. Geology has won multiple awards from Men's Health Men's Journal as one of the best grooming and skincare companies for men. I'm telling you, because it's what I use on myself, it's the only thing I would recommend for you to use as well. If you've ever wanted to try Geology, right now is the time to try this for Black Friday, it is the cheapest you'll ever get. Look, bro, right now it's an actual steal. Like, I don't even know how they're making money. So if you want to try Geology, the best skincare in the game, right now is the time to do so, the link's down below. But to get perfect skin, it doesn't stop at a face wash. Let's go to the moisturizer aisle. Instead, you should go for a moisturizer that contains hyaluronic acid. You can see here, this is a daily moisturizer from Geology. It also has SPF 15, which is incredible. Hyaluronic acid is not an oil, so it's not gonna clog your pores. Instead, what it does is it helps your skin retain the moisture that you get from drinking water or when you shower. And like I said, it also comes with an SPF, so it's basically a two-in-one. You're also protecting your skin while also hydrating your skin. This is why Geology is where there's one of the best skincare products in the market, and right now is the time to buy, bro. These two simple products will clear your skin forever. Look, at the end of the day, you're only gonna need three simple products, you just gotta make sure they have the right ingredients. You can buy them from your local stores. I gave you the ingredients you should look for, but if you wanna make it as easy as possible and as cheap as possible, check out Geology. They win Moto Bro awards. It's the only brand I've used for the last five years, and right now they're having the Black Friday set, which means you're about to buy Geology at the lowest price you'll ever see it. You know you're buying the good stuff. You guys wanna check out Geology, click that link down below. Get those three products, and I promise you, you're gonna have a skin you've always wanted. Resolution number three, get a girlfriend. I'm going to get you a girlfriend in 2025, and I'm also gonna show you where you're gonna look for this future wife of yours. Look, this is the third most common resolution almost every guy has. Finally get a partner, a girlfriend. But most men never do because, well, you're overthinking the process when in reality, it's so simple to do it. And most of these guys will watch all the YouTube videos. You'll watch my videos on what girls want and how to get them, but they never actually get girls. By the end of it, most of these guys can tell you how to get the girl, but they never can get the girl for themselves because, let's be real, you don't even know where to look for all these hot chicks. Where do you go to get these girls? The solution is to stop watching all these YouTube videos, including my own, and use kinesthetic learning, which means you're gonna learn by doing, not by studying. So I want you to right now go to a site like meeting or Facebook groups, and I want you to find groups in your area that are centered around these 10 hobbies. All of these hobbies have a high concentration of women. So in order of lowest, the highest concentration of women. First, photography clubs with 90.5% women. Next, swimming clubs. Third, gardening groups. Fourth, riding clubs with 93.8% women. Fifth, painting classes. Sixth, woodworking classes. Seventh, cooking classes. Eight, instrument classes. Ninth, language classes with 95.6% women. And the most popular one, bro, join a book club. 98.6% women, bro, you're gonna be the only two there. At that point, if you can't get a girl, I don't know what else to do for you, bro. But by this point, I'm gonna get you ripped in 2025. I'm gonna make you glow up in 2025. And I just showed you where to find your future wife in 2025. Your boy's not playing around this year. I want 2025 to be the greatest year of your life. And for that reason, there's two more resolutions you need to have on your list, and I'm gonna help you accomplish them. Resolution number four, quit your worst vices. Almost every person's New Year's resolution starts with a list of things people wanna quit, which is amazing because there's eight toxic vices that most guys wanna quit and they never do. These include alcohol, cigarettes, vaping, marijuana, watching porn, fapping, scrolling on TikTok and eating junk food. I'm gonna show you how to quit all bad vices with a cup of water. Right now, as you're watching this video, go and fill a glass of water to the top. I can give you a few seconds. Now, let your back. I want you to grab this either out in front of you or out to the side of you, whatever you want. I'm gonna keep it to the front, make it easier for you. You see, most men never truly quit a vice because they think they have weak willpower. The truth is, your willpower, it's like any muscle. As a matter of fact, according to the American Psychology Association, if you give your willpower the right stimulus and the right nutrients, it's gonna go stronger. If you neglect it, it gets weaker. At first, this glass that you're holding, it doesn't feel that heavy, but if you're doing it with me right now, I'm already starting to get the burn in my shoulders. My muscles are starting to fatigue. That lightweight glass of water that wasn't a big deal is now starting to feel heavier and heavier, your willpower is no different. If you wake up, you have alcohol in your fridge, your vape is in your drawer, you have your favorite porn bookmarked on your phone, it's gonna be easy to resist these bad vices early in the day when your willpower is strong. But as time goes on, that temptation will become heavier and heavier. Your willpower will fatigue, just like in my shoulders. As a matter of fact, I got a trot. Bro, god damn, I'm getting a burn. You have to understand, to overcome any vice, you have to remove all temptation. That could fatigue your willpower. You wanna remove it from your phone, from your house, from your car, from your life. Then replace that habit you wanna fix with some healthier alternative. You can replace alcohol with 0% alcohol. You can replace cigarettes with a ZIN, or Coke with Coke Zero. Then when you're finally faced with that vice because you haven't weakened your willpower, you can finally say no after all. Resolution five, make more money. I want you to be a millionaire in 2025 and you're never gonna get there. Because you're falling victim to stimulus driven behavior. To truly succeed in whatever you wanna do, you need results. But to get those results, you need to push through the ideation phase into something that I call the preparation phase. So you can finally get into that result phase that you're looking for. When you first start something new, like a business or a side hustle, you begin with the burst full of motivation. And this is what gets you through the ideation phase, when you have all these ideas. But as soon as you enter preparation phase, which involves all the boring work, working long on your own, on weekends. Outseeing any immediate results. This is the boring phase. It lacks stimulation. So most men in this phase, they start looking for new stimuli, so they can get that stimulation again. And as a result, you jump into something that's more attractive, something that's high stimulus because it's new, like day trading or drop shipping. But then you'll hit that preparation and boring phase again, and you'll just end up switching to something else. Come a millionaire in 2025, you can solve this stimuli problem with what I call the PPP framework. Here's how you're gonna use it. And I need you to pay attention. Sit down right now, grab a piece of paper or open the note app on your phone. I want you to make one column, label it passion, and write down everything that you're passionate about doing. It literally could be anything. Working out, playing video games, reading books, doesn't matter. Next, you're gonna make a second column right next to it, and call it profit. And I want you to look at all your passions and try to figure out which of these passions you can actually get paid for. Finally, you're gonna create one last column and call it purpose. I want you to transfer anything from the profit column into this column as a role that you can take on, or something that you find purpose in. For example, if you love the gym, you could provide personal training services. And you become a personal trainer, which has high purpose because you're helping other people live healthier lives. This will have much more meaning than you jumping from day trading to drop shipping to E-Com and never committing to anything. You listen to me and I'll make sure 2025 is the greatest year of your life."

        "transcript": " The perfect shower routine for men is quick, effective, and it should make you attractive. And most of you miss out on this because you don't know how to shower properly. But that's fine. The brother has you because today I'm going to show you the perfect six-step shower routine. Let's get showered together. Let's toss. Let's go. Number one, before we step on the shower, you need to use the right products on the right days. The best shower routine is the shower routine that gives your face and your hair what it needs and in the amount it needs it. So here's a quick weekly schedule you can use to make sure you're not underdoing it or overdoing it. First, you should wash your face every single day. As long as you're being gentle with your skin, you shouldn't damage it. Next, you should follow up by applying moisturizer every single day. This is going to lock in hydration and avoid flaky skin. Next is exfoliation, which is something you only want to do a few times a week. For example, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Exfoliation is necessary for cellular turnover, which simply means less scarring and newer-looking skin. But if you do this too much, it's going to overdo it and strip your skin of its central oils that it needs. Next is daily shampooing, which is a no-go unless you have super greasy hair. For most guys, you want to wash your hair every two days. This is going to retain all those oils and hydration your hair needs so it looks healthy. As for conditioning, you should do this every day after you shampoo and even the days you don't shampoo. This will keep your hair looking smooth and healthy. Look, we haven't even stepped in the shower, but if you just change the frequency at which you use the products you already have, your hair and your skin is already going to look better. But there are six other steps in the shower routine that I formulated to make you look your best. So I need you to lock in. Let's get started. Number two, I need you to learn to take a shower depending on your skin type. Look, there is a perfect time to shower, but it's not what you think. According to experts from Penn University, showering in the evening and showering in the morning both offer different benefits and it all comes down to your specific skin type. If you're a guy with oily skin, then you'll want to shower in the morning. This is ideal because this is the time when your skin is going to be more receptive to products and a nice shower can open up the pores and increase absorption. But if you have dry skin, then an evening shower might be better. So you're not overdoing your skincare and damaging your skin. So the perfect time to shower is not morning, it's not evening, it's whatever is best for your skin type. Number three, you're going to learn how to wash your body the right way. See, when most men step into the showers, they make three common mistakes, which is what leads them with bad skin and bad odor. First, most men barely wash their bodies. You know what I'm talking about. You just let the soapy water run down. But if you want to prevent bad body odor, you need to target the five key areas that produce the most bacteria on your body. That's your under-arth, your feet, your neck, your groin, and your rear eye. Now, in these areas, you want to target them specifically. Start by wetting your entire body. Then, before you scrub anywhere else, you're going to start on these five key areas and spend around 10 seconds in each zone. After about 10 seconds and you've done all five zones, you're then going to use whatever body scrubber you spread the soap all over your body. Now, you want to make sure that if you use a traditional luffa like this, it has to be silver-infused because the cheap ones that you buy that aren't, they just grow with bacteria, especially when you leave it all wet in the shower. But silver-infused luffas naturally neutralize bacteria. Remember, what we're trying to do here is get rid of bacteria because that's just causing you to smell bad. Now, the one that I use is my PMD's Body Rubber. You guys know I love TNT when it comes to like tools for your skin. Well, they have a bigger exfoliator and this is specifically for your body. It comes with multiple detachable heads like this silver-infused luffa and it's super soft on the skin. It feels great. And also, it means I'm not spreading all bacteria around, but this thing vibrates at 7000 rpm. So, is that just me scrubbing? The vibration are literally breaking down the dirt in my pores, making it easier to exfoliate and smell amazing. This is my secret weapon. Now, the necklace that every guy is making is with exfoliating. Look, all of you are exfoliating every time you shower. You just don't realize it. And the reason you're messing up is because you're doing it with the luffa that's damaging your skin or even worse, you're doing it with a dirty wet cloth that just hangs in your shower all week and that's what you're rubbing your skin with. And then you're wondering why you're breaking out with body app. Look, if you don't have a body scrubber like I do, use a high quality homemade body scrub. We literally just grabbed a little bit of olive oil, some coffee grounds, mix it up. While you're in the shower, target any zone in your body that that you're doing with that has acid. Coptic grounds are great and not only exfoliates the skin, but study shows that when caffeine is applied to the skin, it pipes against oxidative stress, which helps you fight against acids. Now, for those of you that want to take it to the next level, listen to me, bro. Get a PMT body scrubber. Remember, I said they have multiple heads. So all you gotta do, if you don't want to deal with making a whole body scrubber, flip it around and you have silicone bristles on the other side. You turn it on and you just start scrubbing away. I usually do with a ton of back active and acne on my shoulders because of the gym. Those bristles, it's like when you exfoliate your skin with the silicone scrubber. These are way better at cleansing out your pores than your fingertips will ever be. I'm telling you right now, you do one shower with this body scrubber, bro. Your skin is going to feel insanely soft. It is game-changing after your first shower and then from day to never go back to your conditional chi lupas, bro. I'm telling you, listen to me, but you don't at least listen to this next mistake. It is the worst one and that is once you're done. You're not moisturized once you step out of the shower. If you skip this step, it leaves your skin vulnerable to dry and cracking, which is going to make you look older and increase your chances of body act. So as soon as I step out the shallow, I'm going to apply moisturizer within 30 seconds of drying my body. This is going to lock in whatever moisture is left on my skin and make sure whatever body moisturizer you use has ingredients like hyaluronic acid or aloe vera. By the way, while you're applying the moisturizer, remember the body scrubber? You can take off the luffa head and put on the massaging head. So as you apply moisturizer, you can give yourself a massage, bro. I can't tell you how many times I'm sore. I'm all tight. My chest is tight from the gym or jujitsu, bro. I grab this lupa. I start like massaging the knots as of applying moisturizer, not only in my increasing absorption, but it feels relaxing. It's like a spa session. I want you to name me a better body scrubber in the market where you can get all of that utility in one. You won't find it. You won't. Trust me because I love this body scrubber is a five in one where you get a body massage, a silver infused luffa, a silica scrubber, and a pumice stone styro plate, which you apply to the back to remove any causes on your fingers or any causes on your hands or on your feet. This thing will have you stepping out of the shower or completely new man. And if I were you, I would run and click the link down below and check out the PMD body scrubber right now for Black Friday. If you've ever wanted PMD, now is the time to shop. They have it at the lowest price you'll ever find the rest of the year. So if you see me talk about PMD and how great it is, it's because it's amazing. If you couldn't afford it then now is your time to go. Bro, pick one up for yourself and as a gift. This thing, it's amazing. You guys want to check it out. We've been in same disc cafe. You'll never see again. Click the link down below. Number four, use the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair tight. Look, if you want thick, healthy hair that never falls out, you just have to take care of its porosity, which is how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture. Now, if you don't know what porosity is or you don't even know what your hair porosity is, you could do a simple water test. Grab a cup, fill it with water, then go to your brush and just pluck one hair strand from your brush. I want you to add the hair into the water and observe what happens. If the hair strand sinks to the bottom, that means you have high porosity. You're healthy. If your hair strand floats at the top like mine for a little bit and then sinks, it means you have medium porosity. But if it's like mine and it just stays on the top floating, this means you have low porosity. If you have low porosity hair like I do, you need to look for lightweight products that have a glycerin or aloe vera, which is why I'm using here. Heat is also good for you if you have low porosity hair. So make sure you use a hair dryer to increase product absorption. If you have medium porosity hair, you want to look for balanced products that contain a good balance of both humectants and proteins like organ oil, pova oil, and shea butter. These will be in the ingredient list in the back of the bottle. For those of you that have high porosity hair, you need heavy moisturizing products that lock in the moisture. You want to look for ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil. Now by this point, like I promised, you have the perfect shower routine. You're using the right shower schedule. You're showering at the right time for your skin. You're showering with the right temperature. You're scrubbing the right area. And now you're using the right product for your hair type. This is the perfect shower routine because it's scientifically backed to make you look good, make you look attractive. And there's two last things I need you to know so you don't screw this up. By you need to treat these three areas that are just making you smell bad. Smelling good. It is one of the best things you can do for your attractiveness. The reason you smell bad because you're allowed to remove the three types of bacteria that cause bad odor. The first type of bacteria that's responsible for your bad odor is called halitosis. To combat this, you need to brush your teeth thoroughly for two minutes, twice a day. You need to floss every day and you need to scrape your tongue. And you can do this while you're in the shower or as soon as you get out of the shower. The next type of bad bacteria is called auxiliary, which is the one that's spout under the arms. For this, you want to scrub well in your armpits, which I showed you how to do, but you also want to let the soap sit there for a minute to allow it to absorb in the skin and neutralize any bacteria. And for better results, listen to me. Use the PMD scrubber if you buy it because the technology can remove up to 600% more bacteria than just your hands alone. Five litters, there's a bunch of volatile compounds found on your feet to eliminate any foot odor. You need to wash your feet with antibacterial soap and pay close attention and wash in between your toes. Number six, do not make these ten mistakes that are keeping you ugly. You could follow everything I just showed you in this video and completely ruin it by making any of those mistakes I'm about to show you. So to keep it simple, here's what men should and should not do every time they shower. Do not rub your body with a towel. You want to pat dry your skin. Don't shower twice a day. Do put a limit and only shower once a day. Don't use three or one products. Do use products that are made for each area's needs. Don't use a bottle soap on your face. Do use a gentle facial cleanser. Don't leave your hair wet without drying. Do blow dry it on a low heat setting. Don't forget to moisturize after shower. Do apply something right after. Don't scrub your skin too hard when you're exfoliating. Do use gentle circular strokes. Don't forget to clean your shower. Do set up a cleaning routine to prevent mold. Don't use a towel more than three days in a row. Do change your towel weekly. Don't apply deodorant on wet skin. Do apply on dry skin. That's it. You listen to me. Avoid these mistakes and apply the first five tips I just showed you. You will have the perfect shower routine that will make you more attractive."

        "transcript": " Men who smell good are perceived as far more attractive as those who don't. Most men, they assume that you need an expensive cologne to achieve this. You don't. I'm going to show you how to smell great every single day with what you already have in your doubts. Sower number one, stop wearing deodorant. When it comes to smelling good, most men, they fall into two groups. The first group, they love to spray themselves with cologne. The second group, they just wear deodorant. However, there is a third group of men who do something slightly different. And because of this, they smell better than every other guy. You see, the main cause of body odor is sweat. But deodorant, it doesn't block sweat. What it does is that it only masks any bad odors. Cologne doesn't block sweat either. It does the same. It just masks any odor and makes you smell nice. The problem is that sometimes your body odor is strong enough that it breaks through any of those barriers. This is why the third group of men not only use both, but as well, they use antiperspirants. Antiperspirants use aluminum salts to block your sweat glands, reducing the sweat in the process, which prevents any bad odor. So instead of just applying one of these three products, here's how you should do it instead. You will start by applying antiperspirant the night before to allow the aluminum salts to block your sweat glands and your pores overnight. In the morning, you will apply deodorant and then you apply your favorite fragrance. That's it. You do this one tip. Forget about everything else in the video, and you will smell better than any other guy out there. But this is just the bare minimum. If you really want to smell good all day, you need to keep watching because I have six more steps that most men have never heard of. Number two, never wear clothing that's made from this fabric. Most men just throw on any t-shirt or hoodie and they call it a day. But what you don't realize is that the fabrics that you're wearing is what's making you smell bad. Even if you put on cologne, deodorant, and antiperspirant, you see in a recent study, a team of researchers put threads of cotton, work your eyes, cotton, viscose, wool, nylon, and polyester inside a bottle of artificial sweat. After 24 hours, they dried all the samples and used a mass spectrometer to analyze the odor. Here's where it gets interesting. The fabrics that smelled the least, even in sweat, were cotton and mercury-ized cotton. Nylon and wool, they smelled the worst at the start, but then slowly they became less and less smelly as the day progressed. But polyester, it smelled the worst out of all of them and actually made the smell worse over time. So if you're going to be around a girl, you're going on a date, you need to make sure that you're only wearing clothing that's made from cotton or cotton-like fibers. You want to avoid polyester in Ireland and whatever you do, even though these polyester shirts are breathable, air wiki, whatever sweat you have, making it smell worse. Three, don't make these five mistakes to have fresh breath. If you avoid these five breath mistakes, you'll never even need to chew gum again in your life. You'll just always have fresh, minty breath first. Never store your toothbrush in an open room, especially with a toilet. When you flush that toilet, bacteria spreads through the air and ends up on your toothbrush. Instead, keep your toothbrush in a drawer or in a closed cabinet. Second, you don't have to brush your teeth for two minutes. You just got to make sure you're doing it well. And you explain. You see, in a recent study, they found that if you brush your teeth properly for less time, it was more effective at removing plaque and bacteria than you brushing longer, but with poor technique. To brush correctly, you use gentle pressure. You should line your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle against your gums and then brush in up-and-down circular motions. And if you really want to take it to the next level, don't use a manual toothbrush. Use an electric toothbrush. As studies show that toothbrushes that vibrate are 10 times more effective at removing plaque. This is why I always recommend using an electric toothbrush. The one that I've been using lately, which is revolutionary, is called the Socas Neal II. It uses high-frequency vibrations to help clean your teeth, which a lot of toothbrushes do. But it also has built-in water flosser inside the toothbrush head. I've never seen anything like it. I remember the first time seeing it and for it, I knew I had to pick it up. It was the best decision I've ever did. On top of that, it has a 30-day battery life. Meaning, I don't gotta charge this thing every day. And because it has three-intensity settings, I can find the intensity that works best with my teeth and my gum line. And every time I brush my teeth with this thing, my teeth just feel clean. Next, never use flavored flosser. As many of these contain forever chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer. Instead, you should look for unflavored and unwaxed floss, as this is just a natural fiber that you're using on your teeth and gum line. Now look, both waxed and unwaxed floss are equally effective at removing plaque, which is preferred unwaxed because it doesn't have any forever chemicals. But if you want the most effective method here, use a water flosser. Because studies have found that water flossers are more effective than manual flossers at removing plaque and reaching hard-to-reach areas. And like I mentioned, I don't have both the water flosser and the toothbrush. That's annoying. My Soka's toothbrush is a water flosser built-in, having a 0.6 millimeter water stream, which can clean any crevice of your mouth. It also makes flossing easy to integrate. I don't need to be buying floss or have two separate devices. I literally just brush my teeth, turn on the water flosser at the same time, and now I'm flossing my teeth as well. It is the most efficient way to take care of your teeth. That's why I said this thing is revolutionary. And if you go look at their sites and their reviews, they are 35 times more effective at removing any teeth stains and 100% more at removing plaque. Bro, if you want to have fresh breath forever, you don't have to be buying gum in mouthwash. Buy a good toothbrush. And if you buy something like this, that's both a toothbrush and a water flosser. Bro, your dentist is gonna thank me after this one. And right now for Black Friday, you're gonna get this toothbrush at a crazy low steel. If I were you, I'd click the link down below. Go check out Soka's right now. Look at the toothbrush. This thing's crazy, bro. Fourth, don't chew flavored gum or gum with sugar. You see, gum can freshen your breath temporarily, but the sugar in the gum can feed the bacteria in your mouth. Making your bad breath smell worse. You want to stick to sugar-free gum or gum that has a sugar alternative like xylitol, which has actually been found to improve the health of your teeth. And finally, you want to make sure you swap your toothbrush at least every three months. Toothbrush bristles are typically made from nylon, which easily fray over time. There's also why electric toothbrushes are amazing, because with them, you just have to replace the head, which is incredibly inexpensive versus having to replace your manual toothbrush every single three months. But if you avoid these five mistakes, I just mentioned, I'm telling you, you're gonna have fresh breath for the rest of your life. And if you really want to start at the root cause, it starts with your toothbrush. If you guys want to check out SoCas and see the toothbrush that I've been using recently, this two-in-one water flosser toothbrush, bro, revolutionary. If you guys want to check it out at a crazy steal, click that link down below. Fourth, you're going to triple the strength of your pheromones. Most men know that smelling good makes you attractive, but what you don't know is that you have a natural smell, which is a pheromone that makes you even more attractive. You see, when you swap, you produce bacteria that can cause a bad scent, but we also produce pheromones, which is like our body's own cologne. So I'm going to show you some quick hacks to enhance your natural smell for your date. First, you want to abstain from fapping for at least three days before your date or before you see this girl. When you stop, your body experiences a short-term spike in testosterone and estrogen, both of which boost pheromone production. On the day of your date, I want you to eat foods like parley, parsnips, or truffle. These contain androestinone and adroestinol, both of these compounds, enhance your pheromones. Lastly, you want to work up a good sweat a few hours before your date. The best way to do this is go for a run with a few extra layers or go into a sauna if you have one. When you sweat heavily in a short amount of time, your body produces even more pheromones afterwards. By this point, you're using deodorant and antiperspirant correctly. You're wearing the right fabrics to make sure you smell great. Your breath can be fresh forever, and now you've boosted your natural scent, which is your pheromone, to make you insanely attractive. But I have three more tips left, which is the most important ones of this entire video, which is picking the right fragrance so you actually smell good for the rest of the day. Number five, you're going to use the right cologne depending your age. Picking the right cologne is crucial for smelling great every day, but picking the right cologne is less about what you think smells nice, and more about what your age is and what image you're trying to portray. So here's what cologne you should wear based on your age. If you're a teenager between the ages of 13 and 20, you want to choose a scent that makes you appear more mature, but you don't want to be so strong that it's overwhelming to everybody in your classroom. So pick colognes with woody notes like sandalwood or cedar. If you're a guy between the ages of 20 and 30 years old, women are just looking to have fun, bro, so choose a scent that reflects that vibe. So you're going to go for fresh, incentressy notes like lemon or mandarin to give off that playful, energetic vibe. Finally, if you're a guy that's over 30, you'll want a fragrance that's powerful and strong, with spicy scents like pepper or cinnamon. This is going to help you stand out and project maturity, which is going to give you more confidence and dominance. Number six, use the right cologne for your race. You have to understand we're all different races, and we all produce different amount of sweat and odor. As a result, all women from different races prefer different scents and different notes as what they find attractive. You have to understand one thing, that the strength of your cologne depends on the concentration of oil inside that fragrance. So based on your ethnicity, I'm going to show you what concentration of oil you should use. According to studies, Asian men typically sweat less and have less audio. So if you're Asian, go for a lighter cologne with a fragrance concentration between 2 and 5%, like an American man like myself. We produce slightly more odor. So, bro, I grew up around fragrance and my family loved this stuff. You want a concentration between 5 and 15%. Now we have white men, which generally produce the highest amount of sweat and body odor. So for them, a fragrance concentration between 15 and 20% is ideal. And finally, we have African men who tend to produce the most sweat and body odor. Should opt for a cologne that has a fragrance oil concentration between 20 and 30%. Number seven, use these five hacks to enhance your cologne. Now you know what cologne notes to pick and what concentration to pick. Now I'm going to show you how to enhance whatever fragrance you're using. So here are five simple hacks to make your fragrance last all day. First, studies show that cologne lasts longer unmen with oily skin. So if you're a guy that has normal or dry skin, apply a thin layer of coconut oil on your skin right before applying the cologne. This will not only make your skin healthier, but it's going to make the cologne last longer. Next, you're going to avoid spraying cologne right before exercising your sweat. It's going to break down the sweat and make it fade faster. For the same reason is why you shouldn't apply cologne under your armpits, when in doubt, always use a scent that has vanilla, as it has been proven to be universally attractive. Next, you always want to store your cologne in a cool and a dark place to prevent both the heat and the light from breaking down the notes. And finally, never shake the cologne bottle or rub your wrist when you're applying it. The friction can cause the scent to break down faster. Instead, you should just spray and walk away. You start doing these seven hacks I just showed you boys. Bro, you're going to smell better than any guy."

        "transcript": " Vapping, it feels amazing. It is a short-term fix to a long-term issue of finding a good woman. I mean, all you gotta do is sit down, we get comfortable, and then you just pull out your, pause, come on. You pull out your phone, bro. What did you think I was gonna say? You see, it helps you when you're bored, when you can't sleep, and it lets you fulfill your wildest fantasies. It feels so damn good that over 96% of men do it regularly. I don't know, they're 4%, I think they're lying on the survey. Now that we've given the act its due, let's fap together, and see what would happen if you do this every single day. Day one, this is your initial euphoria. But first, you need to understand exactly what fapping is. It's not what you think. Fapping is the act of self-stimulation to achieve sexual pleasure. It doesn't matter if you're watching porn, scrolling through TikTok, reading a magazine, or you're just daydreaming. If you are touching your private part to feel good, you're fapping. The moment you do it the first time, you're gonna immediately get a mental boost, almost like a power-up in a video game. This is what we call initial euphoria. Your body's gonna power you up with dopamine. This is the reward chemical that makes you feel happy, makes you keep going. Then, serotonin and oxytocin will flood your brain and your body. This is gonna make you feel relaxed and calm. Next, your brain and your body will start releasing endorphins. This is gonna increase your self-esteem. But then, your body will start producing more testosterone, which is gonna make you feel more confident. And finally, once you're done with the act, your body will produce prolactin, which is what helps you relax and go to sleep. You see, when you're fapping, your junk is becoming erect through blood flow, which is actually incredibly important for your health and for your junk, so you never have to deal with erectile dysfunction. You see, when you increase blood flow to your junk, you're also increasing the amount of fibroblasts, which have been scientifically proven to prevent conditions like ED. The only problem is that to do this, you typically need to watch corn, which, as you've probably already found out, will lead you into a dark rabbit hole. The easiest solution to this is to use something to increase blood flow to that region without having to watch that stuff. Something, like the penis pump from Bathmaid, it increases blood flow by using a combination of liquid and vacuum-sealed air pump. I've used this personally. It is incredible, and it even increases the size of it naturally, and don't just take my word for it. You can go read reviews on their site, but I have a link down below. But within seconds of doing it your first time, you go from feeling like a level one player to a high-level boss. But as you're about to find out, this feeling, it's only temporary, and it goes downhill very fast. Because on day three, you will experience short-term side effects. See, by day three, you're gonna continue fatpin' every day, but you're gonna change your visual stimulation because at this point, you're gonna start to experience two of the worst short-term side effects. The first is called sexual desensitization. This happens when you become so used of giving yourself pleasure with just your hand that now, a woman's body, it doesn't actually spark pleasure anymore, or interest. One study found that there is a direct correlation between men who fat too much and their ability to be stimulated by their partners. The second side effect is dopamine desensitization. This happens when you become so accustomed to watching corn in its content that you no longer find normal women or normal sex attractive. By now, you're becoming both physically and emotionally desensitized to sex, which can lead to something called erectile dysfunction. In other words, you can't get it up anymore. And if you have no idea if you have it or you're down this path, on day three, you can test if you have it using the stamp test. I want you to purchase a row of postage stamps and place them along the length of your job right before you go to sleep. If you wake up and the stamps are torn, congratulations buddy. It means you don't have an ED and you probably got happy in the middle of the night. But if they're intact, means that you got no blood flow down there. You didn't get happy in the middle of the night. You might be suffering from ED. Now, fixing your ED isn't easy. Fortunately, one study found that if participants engaged in at least 40 minutes of daily exercise, over just a six month period, they had a substantial improvement in their erectile dysfunction. And that's because every time you exercise, you're increasing blood flow, even to that region. And that's what you need to increase the health of your private parts. Now, while exercise is an easy and natural and free solution, you can speed up the process of this by using the penis pump for bath me. You see, in just two months, over 92% of men who use this product saw an increase in their erections and a decrease in their erectile dysfunction, but this pump doesn't stop there. Look, this is a medical device. It is the only one that's FDA clear. And in Europe, you actually have to get a prescription for it. That's how good this is. But here in the US, you're lucky. You can buy it over the counter. This device doesn't just solve your ED. I'm telling you from personal use, I've used this thing, bro. This thing actually makes you bigger. So even if you don't need extra inch down there, it gives you an extra inch and extra inch in thickness. When I use it the first time, I'm not gonna lie to you, I was shocked, bro. You end up getting an atomic weapon down there. So use responsibly, both for your ED issues or for just personal enlargement. This thing is amazing. FDA clear, it's natural, and all of you can use it and you no longer have to be on the naughty website to increase blood flow and give your meal package the health it needs. If you guys wanna check out BathMate, right now they're running the greatest sale ever for Black Friday. This is the time to shop. You've probably seen me talk about this a few times already because this tool is amazing for men. If you've been wanting to pick one up at the lowest price possible, right now is your time to shop. If you guys click the link down below, they're having a Black Friday sale, this thing's a steal, bro. And look, don't just take my word for it. Go look at the reviews, go read the Reddit forums. This thing works. If I were you, I'd pick one up right now for Black Friday. It's gonna be a secret weapon for you for the next year, bro. I'm telling you, you're gonna be hooked when you look at the size increasement. If you guys wanna check out BathMate, it'll be linked down below. By this point, you'll have experienced the initial euphoria that comes from fapping every day, followed by a drop and a diminish in returns from doing it every day. Finally, you're starting to feel both the negative physical and mental side effects of performing this act daily. If you're at this point, you should stop now, because if you don't, you'll be experiencing long-term side effects for the rest of your life. But let's be real, most of you won't stop now. So what happens when you're on day seven? This is when the long-term side effects start to settle in. By day seven, all these short-term side effects you've been facing will start to slowly morph into long-term ones. These are gonna be issues that are gonna weigh you down. And you, you will have to go through life with these poisons just weighing you down. So to keep things simple, here's every position that's gonna drag you down from fapping every single day. First, you're gonna develop a habit of negative reinforcement because your mind is conditioned to get that fix from digital stimulation. Your brain is gonna lower your self-esteem so you stay isolated and look for that digital stimulation again. Next, you're gonna develop a hypersexual disorder where you now find anything digital sexual and now it's stopping your work in studies because every time you're working your study, you have to go and do it. After that, you're gonna develop dopamine dysregulation where your body is just gonna randomly produce high amounts of dopamine followed by low amounts. Seemingly for no reason, during those lows, you're gonna feel like you're forced to fap to try to bring those levels back to the highs just to feel somewhat normal or somewhat good. You'll also develop avoidance coping where anytime you experience negative emotions like anxiety, stress, or sadness, you're gonna turn to fapping to fix it. And finally, you're gonna develop the worst of them all, cognitive distortion. This is when your mind completely blocks out the negative side effects so you don't even think about it. Allowing you to keep fapping without the awareness of the damage it's doing to you. At this point, you're probably a full blown addict to fapping and you're gonna experience real world erectile dysfunction. If you're at this point, any of this sounds familiar, I need you to go through this 10 point checklist I'm about to show you. Do you have a BMI over 25? Do you sit for more than six hours a day? Do you exercise less than 160 minutes a week? Do you smoke more than five cigarettes a day? Do you drink more than five alcoholic drinks a week? Do you eat fast food more than twice a week? Do you sleep less than eight hours a day? Do you eat added sugars every day? Do you smoke cannabis more than once a week? And do you go to bed past midnight more than three times a week? Look, if you're only doing about three of these on the list, just cut those out and you're gonna improve your ED pretty quickly. But if you're doing more than three of these, plus your fapping, you're gonna need something way stronger to fix any ED issues you might have. And I don't want you guys to hop on, answer any prescription, bro, do it the natural way. Go check out Bath Bay and check out their penis pump. The reason is this natural device addresses the root cause of your problem, which is your blood flow to your private area. It fixes this by using a water pump to stimulate blood flow instead of you having to rely on your own body, which is already jacked up from all the corn that you're watching. Over time, that blood flow gives your junk the nutrients it requires. That's why 82% of men resolve their ED by using this product. And on top of that, you get the added benefit that you also actually make it bigger and thicker. And I'm telling you this from personal experience, when I used it, it's gonna be kind of shocking. The first time I used it, I was like, what the hell? Like, I've never seen that thing that big. That's just a plus. And then on top of all of that, they're having the biggest black Friday sale they've ever had, which means that if you've ever wanted this, you've seen it before, you wanna try it. Right now is the time to act because after this, you're gonna have to wait a whole year paying full price. I don't want you to pay full price. I would click the link down below and go check them out right now. Now we're on to day 30. Just when I call overstimulation, by day 30, this initial euphoria will have completely worn off. And you're junk, it's not gonna be working as well. We're just gonna make it even worse. And the fapping, it won't even feel good anymore. Here's why. You see, when you fap the first couple of times, you get this huge spike in dopamine. For context, if your baseline dopamine is 100%, the first time you fap, you're gonna spike that dopamine to 200%. But by day two, it's only gonna spike to about 195%. On day three, it's gonna drop to around 190%. By day 30, your dopamine's only spiking to about 110%. The reason you feel a bigger boost on day one rather than day 30 is because our brains are wired to seek out new experiences for our survival. Therefore, your dopamine, it's only closely linked to anything new, to anticipation and the excitement of a new experience. So when you fap for the 30th day in a row, you're gonna start to feel full blown signs of overstimulation. This means that the way you feel over fapping won't be quite as good as you did the first time. And now you're just doing it. This is known as the law of diminishing returns. With fapping, this process leads to more men seeking out unusual and darker ways so they can find something new and get that dopamine spike again. So this is when you start exploring darker fantasies to bring out that dopamine spike back to 200%. If you're doing this, you're now deep into the process of addiction. Save yourself, you need to quit right now. Otherwise, it may eventually be too late. Now, if you're listening to this, any of this sounds relatable to you, I sure hope you quit and regain back that self-control. Because if you reach day 100 of doing this every single day, these long-term side effects become permanent side effects where you no longer can operate. That's why day 100 and above, I call this the loneliness phase. And this and at that stage, that's the stage I want none of you to reach."

        "transcript": " There are seven things that make me unattractive. Now, most men, they try to solve these issues with all these expensive products and treatments, bro, you don't need any of that. You can do it all for free. So I'm gonna show you a step-by-step tutorial of seven free things you can do right now to improve your looks. So what I want you to do is, as you watch this video, to do everything that I'm doing with you. One, you're gonna instantly look taller without ever leaving your room. Forward head, rounded shoulders, and Donald Duck butt. These all make you look shorter and less attractive. But the good news is, you can fix these for free without ever having to leave your bedroom. Here's how you're gonna get taller. You see, when you wake up in the morning, instead of you laying on your back, doing scrolling on your phone, I want you to do one simple change. Just turn over on your stomach. This will force your neck to look upward and prevent forward neck. Then, once you get up, I want you to come and stop at your nearest doorway right before I go into the bathroom. I'm gonna put my arms at a 90-degree angle on both sides of the doorway and stretch out my chest. You wanna hold this position between five and 15 seconds. And then repeat it around two to three times. See, most of the time, rounded shoulders are a cause of a tight chest. But doing this in the mornings, loosens up and stretches out that chest so you can fix your posture before you get your day started. And finally, I want you to reach the top of your door frame and grab it. You're not hanging here. You're just stretching your entire body until you feel a stretch in your hip fletcher. Hold this for 10 to 15 seconds. And then release. You wanna repeat this two more times. This is gonna stretch out your hip flexors, which prevents them from pushing your stomach forward and giving you that Donald Duck butt so you can stand up straight and look taller. I want you to make a habit of doing this quick routine every morning when you're gonna start looking and feeling better, all for free. But bad posture is only one of the things that can make you look less attractive. There are still six things that are working against you. And I'm gonna show you how to fix for free, step-by-step, without you having to leave your home. Let's keep going. Through, use free methods to stop hair loss. Look, you can stop hair loss for free if you understand why it happens. Hair loss is caused by a hormone called DHT, which is a form of testosterone, which simply means you can stop hair loss if you can block DHT. And I'm gonna show you three free ways you can block DHT from home. First, you can block DHT with just your hands. See, in a study conducted out of Japan, researchers had nine men use palm-sized head massaging devices on just one side of their head. After 24 weeks, they measured DHT levels and also assessed hair health and thickness. They found that the side of the head that was massaged showed significant improvements in the hair thickness because every time you massage your hair, you're increasing blood circulation, delivering nutrients to the hair follicles and in turn, blocking DHT production. So every night, for around four minutes, you're gonna grab your hands and using light to medium pressure, you can use your palms or your fingertips. I want you to start massaging your hair scalp. I want you to massage in small circles, moving from the front all the way to the back of your head. Now, there is a way to supercharge this. If you really wanna level it up and speed up your DHT blocking game, you're gonna have to use some sort of serum for this. This is a brand called MD Hair. This is my customized hair growth serum. And like you see, it's customized. And what I love about that is that it's fore-realized to tackle that root cause of hair loss for you based on the quiz you take. So with MD Hair, you take a quiz online and then they figure out what's the root cause that's causing your own hair loss. And then they customize a whole line for you. So not only do I have a customized hair serum, I also have shampoo, conditioner, collagen, and even wellness supplements all customized for me personally. So using my hair serum, I apply it into my hair. You wanna get to the root scalp. I do about one ML every night. And now I do the same massaging technique plus your fingertips will move much smoother and the hair serum will do a much better job than just your fingertips. Now the cool part with MD Hair is that you right now can take a picture of your hair scalp. So take a picture of your hair. Go to MD Hair now by clicking the link down below and take the quiz. The quiz is free. Upload the pictures of your hair and they're gonna tell you where you are and what you personally need based on your type of hair loss. It's pretty sick and no other company is doing this. So if you want a natural solution to blocking some of this DHT and also figuring out what's gonna cause your hair loss, I will check our MD Hair. Next, this is not the only way to block DHT. You could also do it with Olive Oil. In fact, in a study done with rats, they found that Olive Oil had a positive impact on hair growth because Olive Oil contains alluropea which prevents your DHT from binding to your hair follicle and you losing your hair. So the easiest way to do this is to grab some Olive Oil, you're gonna apply it to your hair and use it as a hair mask as you sleep. Now, this is a bit messy. If you wanna bypass that, the best thing to do when you're doing these type of massages or leave-in massages, use a DHT blocking conditioner. So when you use a DHT blocking conditioner in the shower, you can apply it on and leave it on for around five minutes and then rinse off to get similar results without having to wake up with oily hair every morning. And finally, you can use four of the best foods to block DHT naturally. The best foods will contain an ingredient called Lycopene which is a great natural DHT blocker. And these are mango, tomatoes, watermelons and carrots. Now look, you have to eat these every single day to get its effects, which is why, while this is a great free solution, it's always best to take supplementation. So if you go to MD hair right now and take a quiz, you're gonna get two supplements, at least into the two that I have. Look, my family deals with hair loss. My brother has it, my dad has it, which means your boy's next, bro. And I'm not trying to lose my hair. So if you go to MD hair, I submitted my pictures, I went through the whole process and they formulated two supplements for me that are great natural DHT blockers with everything I need. There's a collagen powder, but I take every single day. And also the supplement, both of these have all natural DHT blockers. And now I don't have to worry about whether if I'm taking enough lycopene from these four foods that I mentioned. Whether you wanna do it for free or you wanna go the better and more effective route through MD hair, I don't care what route you take, but I wanna make sure you keep your hair. So for those of you that wanna make sure they keep their hair, go to MD hair now, take the free quiz, submit your pictures and look at the customized lineup you could get to save your hair loss. Three, give yourself dark triad facial features. Within seconds, there are three evil traits that women find attractive. These are not as dark triad traits. These are narcissism, Machiavellianness and psychopathy. When people say women love bad boys, what they actually mean is that they're drawn to men that have these traits. So I'm gonna show you how to have certain facial features that's gonna make it look like you have these dark triad traits. First, we're gonna start with your eyes. You're gonna practice in a mirror staring at yourself with the focus, intense gaze. You wanna hold this for a few seconds and practice being comfortable with it. Once you've practiced this enough, you can then use your computer and grab a picture of somebody, somebody's eyes and practice the same gaze. Once you feel comfortable here, I want you to practice this exact same gaze when you're talking to your friends or people that you normally talk to on day to day. As for your eyebrows, you wanna always keep them slightly furrow or almost in a neutral position. You always wanna avoid raising your eyebrows. You can already tell I look more timid or scared for an extra touch. You can learn how to manipulate how you move your eyebrows. You can hold one eyebrow while you raise another and then switch to the other eyebrow. It's almost like you're doing wraps in the gym, but you're really getting that muscle memory on how to keep that eyesight intense. And finally, I want you to tilt your chin slightly forward. Not too much, just enough, just look at the difference. Right here, you can see the bottom of my eyelids. As soon as you tilt your chin downwards, that bottom of my eyelids are gone and you develop that hunter eye look, which looks intense and it makes you look more dominant. Now, after everything you just practiced, take a look at these two shots of on the left. I appear timid, scared, non-dominant. On the right, I look controlled and focused. Number four, make acne go away in two minutes. Look, I don't have a lot of insecurities, but if I had to pick one of the biggest ones, it's acne, bro. So I'm gonna show you how to get rid of acne with a bottle cap and sunscreen. See, your boy has been doing a lot of jujitsu, so I'm rolling, I'm sweating, other guys sweat, the mat's dirty. You can see all the zits on my forehead. Watch how they disappear in less than a minute. We're gonna grab a bottle cap and we're gonna fill it with water up to the brim. Then I'm gonna put it in the fridge and let it freeze for about one to two hours. Once it's frozen, you can take it out and now you have a small ice cube with a handle that you can glide over your U-zone and T-zone, which are most people's problematic areas. The U-zone includes your jawline, your mouth, and your chin. The T-zone includes the middle part of your eyes, your nose, and your forehead. So to do so, just glide it over, over the problematic areas. You're gonna do this for a minute so all the redness and swelling of the pimples come down. Once the size of your acne has reduced, you're gonna then come in with step two, which is a tinted sunscreen. You can get these at any local store. You wanna buy a sunscreen that's the same color as your skin. You're then gonna apply this. Not only is it gonna protect you from the sun, but because it's the same color of your skin, it's gonna get rid of any redness from the pimples that might be left over after the ice. And because the size has been reduced with the ice, all of a sudden, your skin will look flawless. Number five, make your face more chiseled with simply just one line. You see, 99% of them still don't realize by just adding one cheek line to your face, you can make it more chiseled and more attractive overnight. It only takes a few seconds and you can do it completely for free. To start, pick up any razor you have at home. It could be a safety razor, it could be a straight razor, or even an electric trimmer. I prefer a straight razor. Next, you will grab a comb, you can even grab a ruler, anything with a straight edge, and you're gonna line it up, starting from your ear into your mouth. Now, how far down you go, all depends on your face shape. If you have a very round face, you want that line to be about one finger's width above your ear to cover your cheeks and make your face look structured. If you have a very long face, you're gonna aim for the middle of your ear, right here, as this is gonna create a sharp contrast between your skin and your beard, making your face look more compact and not as small. Now, if you have a very angular face and sharp features, you wanna start at the bottom of your ear and go all the way towards your mouth, as this is gonna highlight these aggressive cheekbones and features you already have. Once you figure out where your line goes, I want you to place your comb there and any hair you see all this hair above it, all that hair has to go. Look at these before and afters. I only did one side of my beauty. You can clearly see what happens when you perfectly draw in that cheek line. Bro, at this point, I've made you taller. I've changed your facial expressions. I've saved your hairline. I have fixed your acne and now I've made your face look more chiseled, all for free, all for home, all with the step-by-step guide. Your brother doesn't lie to you. I hope you followed along because these last two, these last two will make you a stud, bro. Let's keep going. Number six, do these three things to get a six pack within 24 hours. One of the most common questions in fitness is, how do you get rid of belly fat? And that's because both overweight and underweight guys all want to have a six pack. But your body likes to add more fat in your midsection to protect your organs. So here's how to flatten your stomach within 24 hours. To start, you're gonna wanna double your water intake in the next 24 hours. By drinking more water, you're gonna flush out excess sodium in your body which contribute to your midsection looking bigger and you're feeling more bloated. Next, you're gonna eat more potassium throughout the day. Potassium also helps get rid of sodium. Some of the best fruits that you can eat that are high in potassium are avocados and bananas. Third and final, you're gonna heavily reduce your salt and your carb intake for the day. Every gram of carb you consume through the day can cause your body to hold onto four grams of water. So when you cut back on carbs, you're gonna see an immediate reduction in puffiness both in the face and in your midsection, making you look much leaner and more attractive overnight. Number seven, you're gonna eliminate bad breath and have white teeth forever from home. First, we're gonna do a spoon test. I need you to grab a spoon and you're gonna place it on your tongue. You're gonna hold it on your tongue for around two minutes. Then I want you to even let that spoon sit for around three minutes. Let that bacteria cook up. I want you to then smell it. Your boy's good, my breath is fresh, but yours might not be. If it smells funky, that is exactly how your mouth smells and I'm gonna fix it for you. You see, if it smells bad, it means that you have a lot of bacteria in your mouth which is causing the bad breath and also keeping your teeth yellow. So here's a free way to get rid of that. So to fix this, I want you to come to your kitchen and grab a glass of water. You're then gonna grab a spoonful of salt and mix it in the water. You wanna mix this until it's fully dissolved. Once the salt is dissolved, we're gonna use this as a natural mouthwash. You're gonna rinse your mouth with this for around 30 seconds and spit it out. Do not swallow it. You're gonna be living in the toilet if you swallow that. So don't swallow it. I warned you. Once you spit it out, I want you to re-dew the spoon test with your tongue and smell your breath now. I promise you, it's going to be fresh. And just like that, I gave you seven free step-by-step steps for you to look as attractive as possible. If you listen to me and follow the law, you're probably a completely new man."

        "transcript": " Over the past 50 years, men are becoming more anxious, more depressed. The reason for this is your mind, your body, and your social life are filled with toxins holding you back. So today, I'm gonna take you on a three-part journey. Where first, I'm gonna show you how to detox your body. Then I'm gonna show you how to detox your mind. And finally, I'm gonna show you how to detox your social life. So by the end of this video, you can have a full reset. Start with a little more. Detox your body. The first step is to detox your body, as this is gonna be the quickest and biggest impact at how you feel and how you look. So, we're gonna start with the first thing, a sugar detox. Because this is how much sugar the average man needs to consume in a day. This is how much sugar the average man is actually consuming in a day. I'm gonna show you five foods that seem like they're low in sugar, but they actually are not. And then I'm gonna show you the benefits you'll experience when you do cut out sugar. White bread has half a tablespoon of sugar per slice. Ketchup has around one teaspoon of sugar. Granola can have up to four teaspoons of sugar per bowl. Protein bars, some have up to five teaspoons of sugar per bar. And pre-made store smoothies, which you think are healthy, but sometimes can have up to 12 grams of sugar per smoothie. Now, if you start to cut out sugar, starting with the known subjects and also the ones I just showed you, this is what you're gonna expect. In the first 24 hours, you're gonna start to think more clearly. Remove some of that brain fog. By 72 hours, you're gonna notice reduced pain in your body. By seven days, your skin will improve significantly and acne almost disappear. By day 30, you're gonna have the best skin of your life and all sorts of scars will begin to fade. And if you can make it to a year, you will completely lose your sugar craving and transform into a new man. Looking this good, it's just gonna be one part of being your best. I also want you to feel and perform at your best. And to do that, we're gonna have to detox a few more things. Two, a gut detox. Yo, my doctor caught me completely off guard when he told me my gut was unhealthy. Because yo, I work out, I eat healthy. So I wasn't expecting this. But when I learned that an unhealthy gut can lead to weight gain, bad skin, and a bad mental state, I knew I had to do something about it. So I'm gonna show you three natural ways to cleanse your gut using a breakfast fast. To do this, you're gonna stop eating breakfast altogether and you're gonna replace it with three super drinks. The first one is a vitamin C cleanse. To do this, you need a peeled ginger, three peeled mandarins. We're gonna do the juice of a lemon, one tablespoon of honey, one teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and one teaspoon of turmeric. Now, we're gonna put this on a blender. You see, vitamin C has been found by studies to increase the production of collagen, which helps keep the integrity of your intestinal lining. You also wanna add a little bit of water so it blends smoothly. Then you can store this in the fridge. You can even buy like little shot bottles so you can just take a shot every morning, but you don't need a lot. Take a little bit like that and just down the pipe. It doesn't supposed to taste good. It's supposed to make you feel good. However, if you want it to taste good, I recommend Aris Coastal. This is a post biotic superfood drink rooted in Japanese tradition that combines prebiotics, post biotics, and probiotics. I used to do this all the time until I found Aris Coastal, my experience. Making this switch has been life-changing. It also has enzymes that are packed with vitamin C. Now to mention, it's clinically proven to help with your gut function, which means it leads to healthier skin and healthier weight. So, the same way you would replace breakfast with this vitamin C shot, you can do it with Aris Coastal. All I do in the mornings, I grab a little bit of sparkling water. It can be flavored if you want it to be flavored. Then I like to eyeball it about a tablespoon of Aris Coastal. You can already hear it sizzling. So, the syrup is about a hundred different fermented fruits and vegetables. And when you mix it with sparkling water, it literally tastes like soda. That was delicious. And my skin has been better than ever. Once I started adding Aris Coastal in my morning routine. And now my body has a literal superfood it's gonna be running on for breakfast. You can supercharge these benefits by doing a full day fast and just taking Aris Coastal three times a day. However, for this, I do recommend you speak to a doctor before you do a full day fast. The second super drink is a salt water flush. A salt water flush helps improve skin by promoting hydration, which in turn leads to the detoxification of the body and the gut. To do the salt water flush, it's the cheapest one. You're gonna grab water and add two tablespoons of salt to four cups of water. You're gonna drink that mixture as quickly as possible on an empty stomach in the morning. By you flushing out your system, you're creating a healthier environment for your gut microbiome. But again, if you're really serious about your gut microbiome because you want better skin, better mental clarity or you want healthier weight, it's just better if you start implementing Aris Coastal to your morning routine like I do. Because this not only supports gut health but it also improves digestion, which means it improves nutrient absorption, appetite regulation and detoxification of your gut. All of that improves your skin and you can do it the same way. You skip on breakfast and you just do one quick drink every morning. Aris Coastal mixes sparkling water. It's the way to go, bro. It's delicious. Now finally, to clear my mental state, I do something called a bone broth fast. Bone broth fast has been proven to provide you with essential nutrients that support digestion and repair intestinal lining. This helps you reduce inflammation. This is the easiest one. Just pick up a carton of bone broth. You're gonna add it into a coffee cup, put it in the microwave for about two minutes so it's warm and then you're gonna sip on that in the mornings instead of breakfast. Again, is it pleasant? Not really. It actually kind of tastes nasty. If you want the most pleasant solution, that's the most efficient and the most powerful for your gut health, Aris Coastal. Like, I can make it simple and just tell you to do this. If you want the free stuff of everything, you can do that. But if you want a super charged version that has a hundred fruits, vegetables, and superfoods all fermented into a bottle, the concentration of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics in this bottle, it's unmatched. I want you guys to test it out. Buy yourself a bottle of Aris Coastal and for the next month, I want you to skip breakfast and just take Aris Coastal to see just how much healthier your gut will get, how much better your skin will look, and how much better you're gonna be able to maintain your weight. You guys wanna check out, it'll be linked down below and you can use discount code TMF15 at checkout. It's gonna make it super affordable. And remember, your gut health is connected to your brain, which takes us to the next part. Now we move on to part two. We're gonna detox the mind. Now that we've detoxed your body from sugar and toxins, we're gonna detox the mind. Starting with the first one, a dopamine detox. This chord you're seeing is about to hit the wall at 12 miles an hour. Right now, your brain is flooding with dopamine in anticipation of what's about to happen. Can you feel it? It feels good. It makes you wanna see more of that thrill and that feeling is a great thing because this response is crucial for feeling motivated when you have to do work. However, if you feel your life with easy dopamine hits, you lose your ability to feel motivated on less interesting tasks, even if they're far more important. The biggest source of easy dopamine, it's your fault. And here's a step-by-step tutorial on how I dopamine detox myself and reduce it from my phone. First, whether you're using an iPhone or an Android, you're gonna go to Settings and navigate to Accessibility. If you're on the iPhone, I want you to go to Display, Text and Size. If you're on the Android, I want you to go to Color and Motion. From there, on iPhone, you're gonna go to Color Filters and turn on Grayscale Mode. On Android, you're gonna go to Color Correction and pick Grayscale Mode. Your phone will now be grayed out. It's gonna be boring. It's gonna significantly reduce any easy dopamine hits you were getting before. The reason is because we've evolved to produce dopamine in response to certain color because typically those colors resemble the fruits in the wild. While you can try to delete apps or set time limits, this is the only method that genuinely prevents you from constantly getting dopamine hits. Next, we're gonna do a negativity detox. Science shows that there is a hidden motivation switch deep inside the brain that drives your craving for hard work and you keep turning it off. Most guys think, oh, I can activate this just by simply adopting certain habits. However, you really need to detox your brain from the obstacles in a way to be able to turn it on. And here's what you're gonna do that. First, I want you to identify everything you think about every morning, whether it's before school or work. If you find yourself thinking, oh, I have to go to work, I have to get up, you need to detox those dots. I want you to start writing down every negative thought just like that one on a notebook or on your phone. And I want you to keep writing them down as you think about those throughout the day. At the end of the day, I want you to review all of your thoughts and identify which are the ones that are having the most significant impact on your mindset. Now, the next thing you're gonna switch it and you're gonna replicate these same negative thoughts with something positive. Instead of saying, I have to work, refrain it and say, I get to work today. Instead of saying, I have to go work out. You get to say, I get to go work out right now. Over time, this is what's gonna turn on that inner switch in your mind, providing you with a constant flow of motivation. Look, at this point in the video, you've detoxed your mind and your body, you're gonna start feeling yourself again. You're gonna start feeling like the best version of yourself. Putting you ahead of most guys right now that just feel terrible, but I want you to feel better than the top 1% of guys. And to do that, you need to detox your social circle, which takes us to part three. First, you're gonna do a social detox. You need to cut out negative friends because of something called social contagion. Studies have shown that the negative influence of toxic friends can increase the thought patterns of suicide and violence. So, I'm gonna give you a checklist to determine whether your friends are negative. And then, I'm gonna show you how to detox them from your life without making it awkward. First, does your friend always swear for no reason? Second, does your friend talk about others behind their back? Third, does your friend judge other people's appearance or style in public? Fourth, does your friend constantly complain about everything, like service, at cafes or restaurants? Does your friend blame women for not being interested in it? Six, does your friend have a one-sided opinion about politics or worldview? Seven, does your friend believe all rich people are greedy and selfish? Eight, does your friend talk badly about their parents or all their ex-girlfriends? Nine, does your friend lie about his achievements to others? And 10, does your friend ever tip at a restaurant? Look, if your friend has more than four of what I just mentioned, that person's probably toxic and is having an impact on your social life. So, here's a three-month plan on how to get rid of them from your life. And your first month, you're gonna stop trying to text them to hang out. By month two, you're only gonna say yes to 50% of the time that they ask you to hang out. By month three, you're gonna stop replying to at least 50% of his texts. After that, you can respond to the occasional message. You can still remain cordial with them, but you do not have to hang out with them. They're gonna eventually get the idea. And they're gonna stop asking you to go out. And now, you've detoxed all your toxic friends out of your life. Which takes us to the final detox, a lust detox. What is the fastest and most effective way to beat your corn addiction and heal your brain from all its negative effects? Is it no-fap, hard mode, or even monk mode? No, it's none of that. The best way is through a lust detox. And here are the five rules you need to follow. Rule one, never work or study from your home. Being in a different environment prevents you from going into that secluded private place and distracting yourself with adult content. Rule two, add friction to your top three worst lust triggers. Instagram, TikTok, and X. You will set a zero minute timer for all these apps to make mindless scrolling harder. And because your phone's already in gray skull mode, because that's what I taught you, it's gonna make it less engaging to watch. Rule three, do not get into bed until you're ready to go to sleep. And when you do, you will read a non-fiction book that's non-sexual. For example, some of my favorites that are easy reads are rich that poor dad or atomic habits. Rule four, do not stare at women's bodies when you're walking past them in public. You can even turn it into a game, bro, where you're only trying to focus on their heads. Rule number five, if possible, you can contact your Wi-Fi provider and ask them to put filter blockers on certain websites. Do these, and this lust detox will be successful to finally quitting your court addiction. And if you do every detox I showed you in this video, your body, your mind, and now your social, you're basically doing a hard reset on your life so you can take full control."

        "transcript": " Most men just spend their entire life just rotting away in their rooms, but it has nothing to do with the room itself and everything to do with what you're doing in your bedroom. So, I'm gonna lock myself in my room for the next five days and show you what you can achieve out ever having to leave your bedroom. Day number one, you're gonna get rid of your morning routine to induce the flow state. You're gonna stop your morning routines because the first hour after waking up, it's the easiest time for you to enter your flow state and you don't even know the feeling of your flow state yet or your full potential because you're too busy doing drawn out morning routines. You see, when it comes to preparing in the morning, you got two types of guys. The first group, this is the type of dude that just rolls out of bed and then just do school on social media till he's tired. The second group is the type of dude that does these long drawn out morning routines. They do the ice bath, then they do groundwork outside. Now, while this is better than the first option, it's still not optimal for a guy like you if you're spending most of your time inside your room. That's why you watch those morning routines and you think, man, that's not practical. I don't need to do that in my life. You're right. Instead, you should follow what the most successful men in the world do in their morning routine. You see, when you wake up, your brain is flooded with theta and delta brain waves. These help you focus on whatever's in front of you. Now, as the day progresses, these brain waves start to diminish. This means that if you wake up, waste your morning routine, and then you start to work, you're gonna have fewer resources or fewer brain waves to work with, which is gonna make it increasingly difficult to concentrate. All right. So before you go to bed on day one, I want you to write down one of the most important things you need to accomplish the next day. I don't care if it's studying for exam, finishing a project on your business, whatever it is, you write it down. Then on day one, you're gonna roll out of bed. And before you do anything, you're gonna start on that task the first five minutes after waking up. Once you can no longer focus, then I want you to go work out, shower, eat breakfast, and carry on with your day. Day number two, you're gonna use AI to create an infinite money glitch. Look, at the start of this challenge, you're gonna feel real motivated and inspired, like, yo, I can do all of this for my room. So I want you to capture that motivation and make a lot of money using this AI infinite money glitch. Here's how you're gonna do it. Grab your laptop. Remember, you're not living in your room. So instead of gaming, do this. Go on your laptop and go on Google Maps. And I want you to find as many local businesses in your area as you can. And I want you to collect their phone numbers and their emails and build an Excel sheet. Next, for each business, take a look at their logo. Some might not even have one. You're gonna then use AI logo makers, which you don't have to do any work for and create a better and more refined logo for them. You will then message that small business with that updated logo, which you can put a watermark on, so they don't use it for free. And to make it even easier for you, you can use this email template on screen. So you don't even have to think about what you're gonna write. Most of them will say yes to their email because it's a free logo and you don't do any hard work. Then you can offer them to build a complete social media branding package, which you will use AI to create as well. And for this, you can charge them $50 to $100 for the service. As you build a larger and a larger portfolio, you can expand to other neighborhoods, other local towns. Eventually, you'll establish a good relationship with probably over 100 clients that you can easily upsell other services for their business, all of which you can use AI for. Bro, at this point, we're only day two inside of my room and you could stop here. You're being more productive starting in the morning. And now I'm giving you a business that you can work on for the next month and immediately start making money with. Essentially, I made you more rich and more attractive and you haven't even left your room, but we still have three days locked up in here. And I'm going to show you exactly what I would do. Day three, you're going to replace education with entertainment. See, after three days of working nonstop locked up in your room, your brain will be depleted of motivation, discipline, and creativity. So I'm going to show you how to refill all three of these with three different styles of content I want you to start consuming. To start, if you want to refill motivation, you want to watch movies of men that inspire you like Braveheart or Hacksaw Ridge, instead of comedies that really don't refill you with anything. Look, if you don't have some of these movies on your Netflix, you can even use this trick, use a VPN so you can digitally change your location and access a different catalog of movies that are only accessible in other countries. I'm going to give you an example of this. I personally use Surfshark VPN whenever I'm watching Netflix. For example, me and my girl last week, we watched The Godfather. Obviously, I got to put her on to The Godfather 2, the sequel, right? Lo and behold, Godfather 2 is not available in Netflix America. So what does your boy do? I pull up Surfshark VPN, I change my location to South Africa and boom, Godfather 2 is available in South Africa. It had the movie that I wanted. This is why having a VPN is so powerful on your phone or on your computer and Surfshark is one of the best ones to do it. Next, if you want to refill discipline, don't watch movies. Instead, listen to podcasts by great thinkers like Joe Rogan, Lex Friedman, and you want to avoid the pointless podcast that just reactive media drama or anything cultural. You can also watch documentaries about great men like Michael Jordan in The Last Dance or Conor McGregor in Notorious. Instead of just consuming mindless YouTube content, I promise you one of those documentaries, you will be refilled with discipline. And again, if they're not available on your Netflix and I'm recommending these to you, just pick up Surfshark VPN and you have an endless catalog of documentaries from around the world that you can always watch. And if you're worried about being able to find the right country, don't even be worried, bro. The reason why I like Surfshark and I'm recommending it to you right now and to download it as a VPN is that they have over a hundred country servers. So you basically, you can pinpoint your location almost anywhere you want in the world and find them. If you really want to influx your creativity, I want you to listen to impactful music by artists that have changed the world, changed culture, such as like Tupa, Kanye or Eminem, instead of rappers that only talk about girls, drugs, and money. Now, because you're going to be spending a lot of time online consuming all this content, the last thing you want is these websites tracking your information. So even if you're not using Netflix, you should still be downloading some sort of VPN and Surfshark's the best one. That way you are fully protected from malware, data hacking, or targeted ads. It could even get your cheaper flights because some airlines awkward cheaper rates if you're in different parts of the country. They also provide a free email generator. So when other companies start selling your email data, you're not slammed with a bunch of spam and garbage email. If you guys want to check out this VPN, go to surfshark.com slash teachments fashion for four extra months of Surfshark at an unbeatable price. You'll be linked in the description. Day four, I want you to do the daily 100 workout to target every muscle group in your body. Look, after a full three days of just being in your own, not going out, your body's going to be all tight from limited movement. But you can easily counter this and get shredded in your room with the workout I call the daily 100. First, you're going to start with 100 pushups. You're going to take your time on the decline and then explode on the incline. Do five sets of 20 reps. If this is too difficult for you, you can do your pushups on your knees. And if it's too easy for you, try pushing off from the ground on every rep. Next, you will do 100 squats and just like the pushups, you will go slow on the decline and explode on the incline for five sets of 20 reps. If it's too hard for you, grab a chair in front of you. If it's too easy for you, I want you to jump off the ground when you explode. Finally, you will do 100 superman. You're going to lay in the ground and raise both your arms and your legs at the same time for five sets of 20 reps. You should feel this in your core and in your back. If it's too hard for you, just lift your arms. You don't have to lift your legs. And if it's too easy for you, I want you to hold it at the top portion for three seconds. You should time yourself the first day you do this and then try to beat that time for all hundred movements every time you complete the daily 100. By using this exercise, you're physically feeling better. You are in cooling your body and you're targeting almost every muscle group in your body from your room for free. Day number five, I'm going to make your room cooler. Well, being almost a week locked up in your room, all those negative side effects of cabin fever, they're starting to pile up. This is the irritability you're feeling from being locked up so much. And you try to cover it up by hitting dope on me every time you hop on social media or play video games. But here's the thing, the man who creates a money making business spends just as much time indoors as the guy that plays video games all the time. So why is it that the business guy gets so much more done and feels great over the guy that gets nothing done and just plays games all the time? It's because he makes his room awesome. And here's four things you can do to make your room cooler for free. First, always open up your curtains for sunlight. Do not remain in a dark room. Sunlight helps your body produce vitamin D, which has been proven to improve your mood, your energy levels, and even your testosterone level. Next, if you have a window, you can open it with fresh air. This will increase oxygen levels in your room, which boosts brain function and overall just well being. It feels better. Next, invest in real plants. You can't afford a plant. Go to a nearby garden or park and pick some out. Because studies show that having greenery or real plants in your room lowers stress levels and makes you feel calmer. And next, buy a small box. It can be a wooden box, a leather box that you can put right next to your nightstand. Next, whenever you come home, put your keys, your wallet, and your phone in that box. That way you're never stressing out about something important you lost and you're always on time. And finally, buy some wet wipes. This is the easiest way to clean your room. Anytime you have a movie or a game loading, grab a wet wipe and start wiping down any dusty surfaces or game console. This is going to reduce the amount of dust in your room so that air quality is better. And you also feel better because your room's always clean. I'm telling you boys, well, you don't have to leave your room to level up. You can spend the next five days doing everything I just showed you and level up without ever having to leave your room. Your room's not the problem. It's what you're doing in there. It's killing you."

        "transcript": " Today, I'll end up reacting to some of the most viral things both men and women say on TikTok. Now, some of this stuff, it's gonna surprise you. But at the end, each of them, I'm gonna show you signs so you know if you're dealing with an evil woman or a good woman. Again, I need my bros to be able to tell the difference. Star number one, she only wants high-end experiences. At least like, you know, nice five-star type of restaurant and then... Never take a girl on a five-star restaurant on your first date and I'm gonna tell you why in a minute. You expect a man to spend $800 on a first date? Yeah. Who's this poor dude that did that, bro? Has it happened before? Yeah. Of course. Of course somebody did that because there's a bunch of sims out there, but you never want to be the dude that takes a girl out for an $800 dinner on a first date. Especially if that's what she requires, that's a major red flag. I always recommend you have your first date at a coffee shop because that way, you'll have the leverage and it can go two ways. If the date you're having with the girl goes well, you can keep it going and immediately just go for a walk with your coffee and it'll long need the date. But if you notice that it's going bad, there's no connection, there's no chemistry, it's so simple for you just to end the date right then without creating any awkwardness or having a high bill. And just like that, I just showed you the first sign that you might be dealing with an evil girl. Now, there's six more we gotta go through. Dude, she has a boyfriend best friend. Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah. Okay. Do you have a boyfriend best friend? Yeah. Is your boyfriend okay with that? Yeah. You used to call your boyfriend- And now we crashed. I can already tell just by how this video is going, it's not gonna end well. Now, I will say that just because the girl has a guy best friend, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. And it's a flag you should be worried about. I'll explain it a bit. You used to call your boyfriend best friend and tell him you broke up when he tried to sleep with you. Sure. Yeah, 100%. You wanna try? That's the first question I'll ask. That was perfect. You wanna meet up later? You want? I'm not liking this girl's response, bro. Here I come, come on. And there you go. Are you gonna meet up with him? Probably. Yeah. We have a boyfriend. And there you go. That hurts me, bro. A brother out there is getting played. Typically, it's the guy best friend that's obsessed with the girl and he's just sitting around waiting for his opportunity. Like you saw in this video, but in this video it's even worse. The girl in the video also has interest and that is a major red flag you have to worry about. Now, a loyal and a good woman, she'll never act like this. Nor will she be in a relationship that she knows makes you uncomfortable, especially if she knows that the other person is interested in you. Sign 3. She lacks faith and trust in you. Girl, it wasn't a date. She literally told me that you took her out to eat. No. Yeah, and you guys hooked up. You can't say you didn't deny that. I am denying because it's not true. I feel like I'm in a Jerry Springer talk show right now. Sorry, saying she's lying? I'm saying she's lying. Let's find out from her. Okay. All right. Damn. When a guy's calling it out to call her out like that, I kind of trust the dude, but you gotta notice what she's doing. She is prioritizing another woman's story over her own man's. Meaning she's in the second stage of distrust already with him. When a woman doesn't trust you, she's going to go through three stages. The first stage is disinterest. If she's acting disinterested towards you, especially in the early stages, this doesn't mean she doesn't like you. This just means she's just trying to figure you out, seeing if you're worth the time to invest into a relationship. The second stage is skepticism. This is when she thinks something's up, right? She keeps asking you questions. She's asking you for the password on your phone for you to always be showing your location. This level of distrust should be a concerning flag to you. And the third stage is avoidance. She's not going to say it outright, but her body language will show it. You'll notice that she's going to be super engaged with her friends and other people, but the moment you start talking to her, her energy will just drop. It's almost like she completely fades when she talks to you. At this point, she doesn't trust you at all. Look, communication is hard in any relationship, but it's even worse when the other person is not listening. This is why it's so important you can have somebody to go to that actually listens to you so you can get an outside perspective. Whether that's a family member, a buddy, a cousin, your brother, it doesn't really matter who it is. It's just somebody that you can trust and you trust their opinions. And look, if you don't trust anybody or you don't want nobody to know your personal things, I recommend check out our sponsor BetterHelp. They're going to match you with one of their 34,000 licensed therapists. You're going to have somebody to talk to that's going to provide you high quality advice, and it's somebody you can trust and can confide in, and you also don't have to see them day to day like a family member. Number four, signs of cheating. I cheat all the time. Are you a cheater? Yeah, repetitively. That's great. This is the thing. They'll never find out that they're being cheated on. I'll just break up with them. The fact that she's proud of that, I got to understand that when a woman cheats, there are certain sides that you can look for in both her appearance and her behavior that kind of let you know, like, yo, you're dealing with an evil person, right? The first sign is that you catch her smiling and laughing by herself. Look, they primarily cheat on an emotional basis, which means when somebody new comes into her life, starts to give her attention, she starts getting that sexual arousal and excitement, you're going to catch her smiling and giggling all the time by herself with no context. It's almost like she's a different person than the one you've been dating. The second side is that you'll notice she starts taking more and more care of herself. More than usual, you see, looking beautiful is a very big part of feeling hot, and this goes hand in hand with sexual activity. And the third sign is she stops texting you when she's out. Look, she doesn't have to be texting you all day long, but if you notice she stops texting you when she's out or when she's out with friends, that's a big red flag because most people, they have their phones with them 24 seven. So if she's not texting you back because you're not a priority anymore, look, picking up signs like this can be tough, especially when you're in love because it's almost like you're blind and you don't see that. When you're in this situation, the best thing to do is get advice from someone that isn't blinded by the situation emotionally, especially if it's a professional, like the advisors from Better Health, they can connect it to a therapist that'll hear you out, point you in the right direction. And the best part is you can communicate that however you feel comfortable, whether that's messaging through a video call or through a phone call. And if you don't relate with the person that well, they can easily swap out therapists until you find somebody that you're truly comfortable to talk to. Look, everyone's situation is different. I just want to make sure you're looking out for yourself and you're taking care of yourself. And if you need somebody to talk to, Better Health is the best solution. It's going to be linked down below or you can go to betterhelp.com slash man's fashion and get 10% off your first month of therapy. Number five, the conversation doesn't matter. I do not accept a coffee or a walk. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Your boy always recommends coffee shop dates. Let's see where she goes. We are doing dinner. You're going to pick me up. We're going to come to the restaurant. We're going to see table manners. We're just going to study you a bit. She's not wrong. You see, this is a great point. Most guys think that a date is all about the conversation and making her laugh. But in reality, most of the times girls are looking at how you. So here are three simple etiquette rules you should follow every time you're on a date. First, never pick up a fork or a knife that you drop. Instead, call over the waiter, let them know you've dropped it and ask for a new one. The reason for this is that if you pick it up and put it back in the table, it's not only rude. Kind of disgusting. Second, you should always compliment your waiter. See, everyone tells you don't be rude to service staff or don't be rude to readers. But that's obvious. Complimenting goes that extra step and it's a great way to show your appreciation. You can do this when they bring you your food or on your way out when they're done serving you. And third, never let the bill come to the table. Instead, I want you to excuse yourself to go to the bathroom and on your way, discreetly grab the waiter and pay for everything before you make it back in the restroom. This is going to remove any potential stress or awkwardness, make your date feel at ease and you, you just look like a man, bro. At this point, I've already showed you five signs that you need to know that you're dealing with an evil person. These last two I have left are truly important and it's going to prevent you from ever getting played. Number six, she doesn't really like you. Number one, a girl will drop a hint in hopes that's why most guys don't understand women. But a woman will tell you straight up the fact of what she wants and expects for you to hint it on your own. That sounds arrogant. Like somebody I don't want to date. Now, here's the problem with relationships. One thing no one talks about is that a lot of women will do things that seem as if they like you, but in reality, they don't. An example of this would be a girl might ask you to hang out with you, but it's only with group activities with other friends. If she never wants to hang out just one on one, it's probably a sign that she likes you as a person, but she doesn't like you as a potential partner. Another great example is when girls only send photos of their face to you on Snapchat. You might think she's into you, but when a girl really likes you, she starts sending more full body pictures instead of just pictures of her face. Like you'll see pictures of her sitting down, pictures of her with her friends, or pictures of her out on her walks or doing her errands. She basically wants to show more of herself to you if she truly likes you. Number seven, signs of being toxic. Five signs you're in a toxic relationship. All right, let's see if I agree with this. Feels like there's constant criticism. I 100% agree with this. A good woman will acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses and celebrate them for you. My wife used to always do this dating and still does to this day. Best decision of my life was marrying her. Two, there's an imbalance of power and you feel like you're being controlled. I see where she's going with this. See, as a man, your woman should always respect you. You as a man should always also respect her and see what her needs and her wants are and make sure you take care of them. You're not your best self around them and you don't like the person. 100%. This is so true. I can't tell you how many times that guy will get with the girl, the girl with their dreams and then they drop the ball. They stop all self improvement. They stop trying to get better or looking better. This sign, this one might be on us boys. Self esteem goes down and you're constantly questioning everything. 100% non-debatable. The girl you're with should be building up your self esteem. If your self esteem is trash, this is an evil person. You keep waiting and waiting for things to get better. Cut it right there. Absolutely. Never wait for things to get better. If things are already bad, this is an evil person and they'll always be this way. Do not wait for things to get better and get out. Look, these seven signs are blatant signs that you're dealing with someone that's evil and it's something you need to be able to recognize early. So you save yourself a world of hard day, bro."

        "transcript": " These are seven bad testicle habits every man should avoid at all costs. Or if your junker gets smaller, it could stop working or even worst of all, you could lose your ability to have kids. Each habit I'm about to discuss in this video gets worse as the video progresses and chances are, you're doing all of it. Starting with number one, prioritizing your health, it's killing your sperm. I want you to take a look at the 25 things that I'm showing on screen right now. Now, get a piece of paper or even on your note app and write down everything that you think of what I'm showing you, lowest testosterone. You see in a survey conducted on a thousand men, researchers presented to each guy these 25 items I'm showing. And then asked which one they believed were lower their sperm count. They then created a chart of the things that men believed lower sperm count, but actually didn't. As well as the stuff men believed didn't lower sperm count, but actually did. Now, here are some of the things the guys thought would lower sperm count. Drinking soap, being stressed, lubricant, bacon. And here are some things they didn't think would lower sperm count, but actually did. Exercise that heats up your package too much. To avoid this, you just want to invest in higher quality underwear when you work out that gives your area more breathing room and is made out of a cooling material like modal. For me, the best pair when it comes to working out are the eight inch sports performance shirts. You can find these on a brand called Sheath. It's all I wear and I 100% recommend is the only thing I trust on my own package. The second are non-stick frying pans. Due to their forever chemicals, they have been proven to reduce sperm count. So it's much better to invest in cast iron pan. Third is eating soy. So if you drink soy milk, replace it with oat milk. And if you eat soy, replace it with another high protein meat substitute like beans or egg. And fourth, this one surprised me, sunscreen, which was found to reduce sperm count by up to 33% because of a singular ingredient called avobenzol. So now when I use sunscreen, I make sure that ingredient, it's not on the list. You just doing this one tip will drastically reduce the chances of your junk getting smaller or it not being able to produce your future children. But I don't just want you to reduce the chances. I want you to eliminate altogether so you can have a healthy package. And to do that, you need to avoid these next six tips. Number two, never consume the five worst carcinogens. I'm gonna show you the five most common products you use that have been proven to increase the chances of a distinctular cancer. The first are candles because they release chemicals like toaline or benzene, which are both linked to cancer. Next are any plastic containers that you use for your pre-cooked meals or any of your leftovers. These contain something called bisphenol A or BPA. They also contain valiants, both of which are carcinogens known to increase the risk of cancer. Be careful with receipts too. I'm talking about the receipts you get after you buy something. The ink, they also contain BPA. Your mattress, it's also a concern. Some mattresses are treated with chemicals to make them less flammable, but these chemicals contain volatile organic compounds which also have been linked to cancer. And finally, watch out for any self-care product like shampoo or body wash that contain parabens or mildehives or cold tar dye. All three of these have been identified as carcinogens linked to cancer. Three, never make these underwear mistakes. I'm gonna show you the top common underwear mistakes most men make that is damaging your pack. First, never use fabrics that trap heat. Materials like cotton, which you're probably wearing, or even polyester, both are known to trap heat. Instead, go for breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics like Modo. Look, this fabric is not always easy to find. It's a little bit more premium, which is why I always recommend the brand called Sheep. They have a dual-pouch design and are made with 92% Modo fabric and 8% elastane. I started wearing these about three to four years ago, and ever since then, I've never gone back. My entire underwear drawer is just Sheep underwear because of how cooling Modo fabric feels. If you've never felt it compared to cotton and polyester, which is what you're probably used to wearing, well, actually, it's kind of game-changing. I'm only going to warn you that once you buy one, you'll never go back. Next, you don't want to wear underwear that's too tight, as this restricts movement and blood flow. This leads to discomfort and even chafing. Instead, you need underwear that gives you room to breathe. Ideally, you should be able to slide two fingers around your waist to come to, or you can even try a pair with an athletic waistband. These provide more support while also giving you that breathability that your package needs. You need that airflow. Again, these boxers from Sheep have that athletic waistband. These are the ones I used to train. Again, my training underwear is specific just because I know I'm going to be producing a lot of heat. If you guys want to check out Sheep or the underwear that I use, I'm going to have it linked down below, and like I said, for me, it was kind of expensive, but for you, it doesn't have to be. They gave me a discount, which I'm also going to link down below. It's a limited time discount. I don't know how long it's going to last because your underwear moves fast. It's that good, but for you, you can try one or two pairs just so you can see the difference that this is going to do for your daily wear versus your regular underwear at a discounted price and see just how amazing it is. I promise you, it's going to be the first time in Christmas you're going to actually ask for underwear. That's how good this is. If you guys want to check it out, Sheep will be linked down below. Next, never buy underwear without proper support. Basic underwear often lacks support, especially boxer boots. This is what causes you to adjust and readjust, which is uncomfortable. Another big reason why I only use Sheep is because they also have a dual pouch design. Dual pouch means that you get two pouches, one for your testicles and one for your Johnson tip. Essentially, each part of your anatomy has its own section. So now it's not moving anywhere. When you wear this, bro, I promise you, it stays in place all day. You never have to adjust. And finally, make sure your underwear is not dirty or any old school style, like whitey, tidies. Just like any other clothing piece, you want your underwear to look as good as possible. I don't even recommend the bright colors either. I recommend you get dark black or dark gray colors, as these are going to be easier to keep clean and you're going to look more attractive when you're wearing it. If you guys want to check out Sheep, like I said, this is my only go-to. I make sure it doesn't have any of the mistakes that I just mentioned. You can as well, if you click the link down below, pick up a pair or two, just to see the drastic difference to them. Number four, never sit the wrong way. If you sit the wrong way, you're going to lead to a negative impact on your testicles and your sperm count. That's not just my opinion. This is backed by study. So here's what you should and shouldn't do to protect your package when you sit down. First, never cross your legs. Instead, sit with your legs shoulder-width apart to reduce any pressure in your private area. Next, do not sit on a hard surface for a long time. Instead, find a soft chair. If you don't have one, try to put a pillow underneath. Also, never wear overly tight briefs. I know I talked about support, but you don't want to go too extreme where you're causing too much heat. So when you sit down, it causes even more pressure. Again, if you listen to me and you checked out Sheep, you don't have to worry about this part because you have individual pouches where everything has room. Next, you want to avoid leaning forward when you're sitting. Always sit up straight or even lean back as this is going to relieve any pressure you're putting on your groin. And finally, don't sit for too long. If you're working all day, try to get up every 30 to 45 minutes and just walk around for a minute or two. This is going to increase blood flow to your junk but also relieve any pressure you're adding. Five, make sure your BMI is not in this range. You have been lied to your whole life. Most men are told that if your BMI is over or under a certain number, they're unhealthy and that this is going to negatively impact their sperm count and their testosterone levels. But the real test is actually how much fat you have on your body. And this, you can test at home. In a study conducted in Korea, researchers looked at 2008 men between the ages of 20 and 67 years old. They compared their body fat percentages with instances of erectile dysfunction. What they found is that men with high body fat were nine times more likely to have erectile dysfunction while men with extremely low body fat were also at a high risk. So what exactly is considered high versus low body fat? Well, the study defined low body fat, anything under 20.5% while anything over 28.9% was considered high body fat. That means that if your body fat percentage is between 20.8% and 28.9%, you are less likely to experience an erectile dysfunction or low sperm count. And knowing that exact body fat number is very difficult unless you wanna spend hundreds of dollars on a body scan. So here's an easy way to estimate it at home. If you have a six-pack with visible veins, you're likely between 10 and 15% body fat. If you have a four-pack with no visible vein, you're likely between that 15 and 20% body fat. If you only have a two-pack with no other visible abs and no excessive belly, you're probably between that 20 and 25% body fat. Now, if you have a bit of a belly and some chest fat, you're most likely between that 28 and 35% body fat. Now, by this point, I have done my job with this generation boys. I have saved every young man's testicles by stopping you taking the worst carcinogens that can lead to the circular cancer, by showing you how to sick around and now by even showing you how to maintain the ideal weight for your testosterone. And I wanna congratulate you too as well. You have drastically reduced your chances of destroying your junk by just watching this video. But remember, I said these tips get worse as we progress. Elastin are the most damaging. You don't stop these, everything else, all this progress we've done won't matter. Number six, never let your testicles get to this temperature. Too much heat can kill sperm and prevent you from having kids. So, here are the most common causes of the stickular heat and how to eliminate it. First, any extremely hot baths, hot tubs or showers, you gotta go. If you still wanna enjoy some of these things, you wanna keep the temperature under 105 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius. Another common source of heat, your laptop. This often happens when you sit on the couch or in your bed and you put your laptop on your lap. If you wanna prevent this heat transfer, put a pillow in between your laptop and your lap. Next, avoid any material or fabrics made from polyester. Is this not only traps, but it's basically a plastic, which is not breathable. Instead, you want either natural fabrics like your cottons or linens, or if it's underwear, your moto. Finally, sleeping in underwear, it's actually terrible for your job. One study found that men who slept naked had higher sperm counts. So, for the nighttime, you can go, commander bro, ditch the under. Number seven, never make these five shaving mistakes. Here are five common shaving mistakes you're making in your private area. But I'm also gonna show you techniques that have been complete game changers for me. Let me show you how to, you're still here. Why are you still here, bro? This is not gonna be a step-by-step tutorial, but I'm gonna show you what to do. Never shave your testicles with a razor without first trimming down your hair with an electric trimmer. Otherwise, you're gonna end up with the worst shave of your life, and I promise you, you'll never do that again. Next, you wanna soak your hair in warm water before shaving with a razor. This is why it's better to do it in the shower. This is gonna prepare your skin and soften the hair so the razor can glide. Never, ever shave against the grain. This is not your face. You're not trying to get the closest shave of your life down there. What you want to do is a safe shave down there. Shaving against the grain will increase your cuts, your nicks, and ingrown hairs. That is not comfortable. Also, never use a body moisturizer down there. Find moisturizers that are specifically designed for your private area, because a lot of these moisturizers will have parabens and sulfates, which are damaging for your testosterone and your sperm. And finally, don't just throw on a cheap pair of underwear. You already know. You want something quality, especially after a fresh shave, to keep that area cool. If you listen to me and avoid the seven mistakes I just showed you in this video, I promise you, you're gonna save your boys and your future generations. I've completed my mission. See you boys next time."

        "transcript": " 93% of communication is non-verbal. Yet most guys are only focusing on what they say when they're speaking. So in today's video, I'm gonna show you 7 things you can do right now with your body language to be perceived as more attractive and more confident. Number one, use this hand gesture to demand more attention. Why do powerful men like Elon and Ronaldo always put their hands like this? It's because you can influence others with your hands, but only if you use the right hand gestures and you use the right hand to do it. In a study published on PubMed, researchers had two groups explain a metaphor. The first group used their right hand to explain, while the second group would use their left hand. What the scientists found is that when a participant would explain a metaphor with their left hand, not only did the explainer feel more confident, but the listener was also more attentive. The reason is that people aren't used to seeing others use their left hand as much as their right hand. So when you're talking to someone, whether in person or at a cafe, you want to make sure your right hand is occupied. If you're standing, you can be holding your phone. If you're sitting, you can be holding your coffee cup. Then you're going to explain using your left hand instead of your right hand. You'll not only feel more confident, the person you're speaking to will be more attentive. They'll be paying attention. Look, body language is that simple. Just by you switching the hand that you use to talk, you're making yourself more interesting. People are going to pay attention to you. It's a massive upgrade. I imagine if you finish this video and you actually apply all seven techniques I'm about to show you. Bro, your charisma is going to be out the roof, bro. Go to number two. Learn to read other people's minds only using body language. By just understanding their body cues, you can influence those around you by knowing what to avoid and you appearing more confident. So I'm going to show you five body language cues you want to study in men. Followed by five body language cues you want to study in women and what they mean for men. One, a soft and weak handshake. This means they lack confidence in what they're about to say. Two, if the first words that they speak are soft or they're broken, that means that they're intimidated by you. Three, fidgeting and playing with their nails. It means that they're nervous. Four, if a man can't maintain eye contact, it means that they're threatened. And five, if his feet are pointing away from you, it means that they want to leave that situation. You want to study these five signs to always understand what type of man you're talking to in front of you. Now here are five cues for women. One, a slight tilt in the head means that she's genuinely interested in you and what you're saying. If she's neutral, it means that she's disinterested. Two, if she's within two feet of you, it means she's comfortable with you. If she's standing outside of that distance, it means she's uncomfortable with you and wants to leave. Three, if she's using a lot of hand gestures while she's talking, it means she's emotionally invested in what she's saying. Four, if she's touching her jewelry or her neck, these are known as pacifying gestures, which suggests she's feeling nervous. Five, if she smiles with her teeth, it means she wants to continue talking to you. If she smiles just with her lips, it means she's just trying to be nice to make you feel good. If you know these five female body cues, you'll always know exactly what she's thinking. Let's move on to number three. Use the right power color to look your best. As a man, you want to wear more color, you just don't want to wear it like this. Each color here looks good on its own, but together they clash and they make the outfit look messy. So here's how you're going to wear color the right way. First, you're going to find out what color looks best against your skin tone by looking at this skin tone color wheel. For the cooler skin tones, the brighter colors like blue, green, and yellow look great. For warmer skin tones, shades like dark blue, purple, or red are flattering. If you want to check your skin tone, you just want to hold a white piece of paper next to your face and look in the mirror. If your skin looks yellowish, you're warm tone. If your skin looks bluish or pinkish, you're a cool undertone. And when you're picking an outfit, only keep the colors on your outfit. Try to keep your shoes neutral, that way you can wear colors easily. For example, I love wearing sneakers. Now, the one thing with sneakers is that they get dirty very fast. I hate that you have to be replacing them unless you try these from Vessi. Bro, I found these the other day and I've been wearing them nonstop. These are the black title sneakers from Vessi and they're waterproof. They're high quality and they're super affordable for how they are. What I love about them is that I wear sneakers way too much and I'm tired of replacing them. But with these because they're waterproof, they rarely get dirty and to clean them, it's a breeze. They're in dry in style with select waterproof vests. Now, just $99 at Vessi.com. Don't wait. I'm going to have Vessi linked down below. They have a wide range of shoes. They're all waterproof. And like I said, they're affordable. So there's a style for everyone. I'm also going to have a special code that's going to make it even more affordable for you. Next, once you've chosen your color, you're going to use contrast to make that outfit pop. Let's look at the color wheel again. Colors that are across from each other are complementary colors and they make each other stand out. Colors that are next to each other are analogous colors, which makes a contrast way more subtle but still look good together. To wrap it up. If you're choosing to wear more color in your outfit, you can neutralize your sneakers even more and you can use something even more subtle like black. Vessi has a great pair of sneakers called the Stormburst Sneaker. It's a black pair and these are waterproof as well. And because they're black, these will rarely get dirty. In other words, you can pretty much mix and match with any color outfit you have and you can be rest assured you'll always look good. And the best part is because they're high quality, you're not going to be replacing these. If you guys want to check out Vessi, they're going to be linked down below. Look at their entire range, but the true that I suggest, which I wear all the time, are the Stormburst Sneaker. I'm going to have those linked down below so you can wear the same ones that I wear. It's easier. Four. You're going to maximize the three elements of your foot body language. I'm going to show you three things you didn't know about your feet and what they're saying when it comes to body language. The first one is proximity, which refers to how close you are to someone when you're talking to them. If you want to show your comfortable, you need to place your feet within two feet from the other person. If you want to convey discomfort, you want your feet at a distance and you want to be outside that two foot range. Next is direction, which indicates where your feet are pointing. If you want to show interest, always point your feet towards the person you're talking to. Conversely, on the other hand, if you're in a conversation you want to get out of, you want to point your feet away from them to signal that you want to leave. Finally, we have stance, which refers to how far apart your feet are. A wider stance, it conveys dominance and confidence. A narrow stance may come across as weak or insecure, so you always want to stand around shoulder width apart. With that said, look, there isn't any point in putting this much effort in your feet if your shoes always look messy, which is why you should check out Vessi, bro. Damn, I made that rhyme. But the point is, you don't want to be in a conversation with a girl or with anybody and they look down. Your body language is on point, but your shoes are all scuffed up. How good you look depends on what you're wearing. It is so simple when you buy quality sneakers that look good with everything. Like the two that I just picked up from Vessi. Bro, these sneakers are so stylish, it makes any fit look good. If you guys want to pick out the two pairs that I wear, I'm going to have them linked down below. Like I said, I recommend the white and the black, because they're just easy to pair with anything. Plus, there's going to be a special discount that's going to make it a steal. 5. You're going to influently become more attractive by walking with confidence. Most men will walk with their head down with this forward tilt and a hunched back. It's like a nerd neck. This makes men appear weak and unattractive. I don't want that for you, bro. So here's how to fix these issues so you can start walking with confidence. I want you to stand up right now and follow these instructions. First, before you even start walking, I want you to imagine a tiny string attached to the top of your head and attached to your ceiling. This is pulling your head upwards, pulling your chin slightly up. Next, you're going to pull your shoulders back and down until you feel a slight tension on your traps and upper back. Now is when you start walking, but notice I'm not looking down. My hands are in my pocket. I'm not looking at my phone. I'm looking straight ahead while my arms are swaying parallel to my upper thighs. This is what shows dominance, confidence and control. Now, if you really want to level this up to the highest level, you want to add a slight sway to your shoulders. To do this, you're going to let your hands swing slightly more towards the back swing of your stride. This will push your shoulder back a bit to create a natural sway. This is insanely attractive in the same way how women sway their hips when they walk, that you find that attractive. Similarly, women will notice that sway in your shoulders and find it attractive because it conveys confidence. Six, you should never do this when you're sitting down. Look, there are a few things you can do to drastically appear more confident anytime you're sitting down. First, you want to avoid any body language that makes you appear small, like sitting with your legs closed. Instead, keep your legs or knees shoulder width apart and open. Second, avoid leaning in with your head and your body. Instead, you want to lean back while you're extending your legs outward. Third, never look down. Always keep your head and your chin up to make it easier. Just focus on looking in between the eyebrows of the person you're talking to. Fourth, avoid any pacifying behavior such as biting your nails, playing with your jewelry or rubbing your arms as these are signals of discomfort. And fifth, you want to steer clear from any erratic behavior, like tapping your fingers or your feet constantly, or like moving your head around looking everywhere. Instead, remain calm. Now, you've learned how to use hand gestures to command attention. You've learned to read other people's mind with their body language. You've learned how to move your feet to look more confident. You've learned how to walk with confidence, and now you've even learned how to sit with confidence. These changes will instantly make you look more dominant and more attractive. That's a guarantee and you can do them now. But there are two more changes I want you to do to your body language that's going to change the game forever. Number seven, use the three second pause to increase magnetism. A super simple way to increase your charisma and magnetism is with your body language and you're going to do it with the three second pause. When someone asks you a question, instead of immediately trying to answer, I want you to look slightly to your side. You can even place your hand near your mouth, almost like you're in deep thought to add even more weight to your body language. You can almost even slightly move back and count to three seconds. When you do this, you signal that you are extremely invested in what that other person is saying, as well as carefully crafting your answer. This demonstrates confidence, self-assuredness, but also it keeps the other person at the edge of their seat, waiting for what you have to say. Number eight, you will use these two hand body language tricks to control any situation. If you want to take control of any situation you face, you need to use these two hand gestures. The first is the play caterer. When you approach someone, you want your hand in your palms facing upward. This creates a very warm and open approach, which is ideal to use with people of lower status. And no, I'm not just saying this as my opinion. This is all backed by science. Biologically, we are more likely to trust someone when we can see their open palms. The second is the leveler. And this is when you approach someone with your palm facing downward. Notice how even my tone changed. That's because this gesture is used to convey authority. Now imagine you use this in two situations. First, I want you to picture me talking to an old friend pointing my hand upward as I face them. Like, yo man, it's been so long where you've been. Now, compare it to this. Hey, how have you been? You see the difference. The first, open and friendly. The second, it's closed off. That is a huge upgrade to your communication style. And all we did was change how you placed your hand. This is why body language is so important. And why I want you to implement all eight body language tricks I just showed you so you can be more attractive and confident."

        "transcript": " I'm 29 years old and over the last decade I built an athletic body. I married the girl of my dreams. I've retired my parents, built eight figure brands, and I created an online community with you guys where we get 150 million views a month. If I could go back and talk to my 20 year old self, here are the seven things I would tell myself that I want you to learn that actually work. Starting with number one, you're going to go to bed and wake up between these hours. You struggle to focus at school at work because you're always just so tired, but that's because you're not going to sleep at the right times. So here's what you should do to make sure you always get the best night sleep possible. First, you're going to try to fall asleep between 9 and 11 PM. This is important because our bodies operate on an internal clock known as the circadian rhythm. According to research, aligning your sleep with your circadian rhythm, which means going to sleep around 10 PM at night, will significantly enhance your rest and recovery. Next, you want to aim to wake up between 5 and 6 in the morning. This is actually the hours where around 67% of CEOs wake up. That's not a coincidence. Similar to going to bed, when you wake up at this time, it aligns with your internal clock and your circadian rhythm, allowing your body to naturally produce more hormones that give you energy like cortisol every time you wake up. Finally, you're going to use the three to one method before you go to bed. Three hours before bed, you don't eat anything. Two hours before bed, avoid drinking any liquids. And one hour before bed, steer clear of any technology that could emit blue light. If I was going to sleep at night, I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. I would be able to sleep at night. No. Did you notice the difference? Imagine someone asks you to do something and you respond with a strong no. Instead of a hesitant no. Even if you don't feel confident, you're going to appear more assertive, which are going to make people respond to you and listen to you. Next, you want to point with your hand instead of pointing with your finger. See, when you point with your finger, it can come across a bit weak and rude. Whereas when you point with your hand, it shows confidence and you command respect. You see, when it comes to body language, it's not always about being loud and puffing out your chest. It's about conveying calmness and control. For example, I want you to watch the gestures between these two shots. On the left, I'm acting erratically. Everything is fast and I seem on edge. On the right, my movements are slow. I'm taking my time. I seem as if I'm in control. It really is this easy to fake confidence and I wish I would have learned this younger. No. 3 Read nonfiction and fiction books at different times of the day. You need to stop reading self-help and autobiographies all the time. See, most men, including myself when I was younger and I was hungry, all I would read was self-help books and autobiographies right before going to bed. But I never considered fiction and this mindset was wrong for two reasons. First, you shouldn't read those self-help books right before bed. You're less likely to retain the information. Plus, it keeps your brain active, which prevents you from having quality sleep, which will further hinder your ability to retain all the information you just read. What I recommend is any nonfiction or self-help book, you need to read those in the morning or listen to them during your commute. That way, all that information, your mind is fresh and you can apply it that same day and it helps you retain the information. Second, as a man, you should read more fiction. Studies show that men who regularly read fiction have higher emotional intelligence and analytical skills, both of which are important in the dating and in the business scene. On top of that, fiction allows you to unwind at night, giving you better sleep. Number four, use the most effective looks, maxing techniques when you're young. Look, I became the goat of self-improvement by trying all the most popular looks, maxing techniques over the last decade. So if anyone is qualified to tell you which ones are the most effective, it's your board and you need to start this young. So I'm going to rank the best techniques you need to start using now based on my results. After testing every skincare looks, maxing technique you can think of, ice rolling is the best one. It's my favorite because it's quick, it gives you a noticeable boost instantly and it's free and simple to do. All you do is grab an ice from the freezer and you're going to roll it across your face evenly for around five minutes. The cold helps reduce blood vessels and reduces puffiness, which ends up making your skin look tighter and fresher. It also boosts blood circulation, which is why your skin gets that like healthy glow right after doing this. I also found that intake in biotin was a game changer. See, biotin is key for healthy hair, skin and nails. Now you should be consuming around 5,000 micrograms of biotin for it to be a considerable amount, which you can get from your diet, from eggs, almonds or sweet potatoes. But let's be real, you're not going to be consuming this every single day. So the best way to do it is by consuming a supplement and the best one in the market is your boys, which is get attractive, a supplement I formulated with all the information that I know from studies and stuff that I've done on myself. I formulated 27 vitamins and minerals that are scientifically proven to make your skin and your hair look as good as possible. And one of those 27 is biotin. And I'm giving you the exact daily dose of 5,000 micrograms every time you take one a day. Because the key with looks maxing is all about consistency. If you're consistent, you will see dramatic improvements. Next, after trying every sort of hair looks maxing technique from derma rolling, scalp massages and special shampoos, I found that the most effective way to keep your hair healthy is with what you eat. Specifically, eating foods that block DHT. See, DHT is our arch enemy for every guy because DHT is what's causing your hair to fall out. Now, some of the best DHT blocking food is your spinach, your pumpkin seeds or your green tea. These are packed with nutrients that keep your hair thick and full and healthy. Then, all the other looks maxing techniques when you do them, they actually are more effective because you have healthy hair. Now, just like biotin, let's be real, you're not going to be eating spinach and pumpkin seeds every day, even though you should, which is why 14 micrograms of vitamin E, which scientifically, according to studies, is a potent DHT blocker. Like I told you, all 27 vitamins and minerals in here, I made sure, are backed by studies proving to help your skin and help your hair because this is the supplement that I take. From all the knowledge that I've had, I've built it into this. Make it easy to just consume appeal and give your body everything it needs to look and feel great.

I suggest you take it for at least 60 days, one a day, so you can actually see a difference and you need to be consistent. Confidence. I tried all sorts of looks, maxing techniques to boost my confidence, but I landed on something that was a bit unexpected. Now, everybody will swear that lifting weights, affirmations, or even meditation helps boost confidence. And while those are solid and I do them myself, nothing boosted my confidence more than running. Man, that sunlight vitamin D plus exercise combo really boosted my confidence and my overall mood. The problem is that most of you are locked up in your room. So no matter what you do, if you're always indoors, you're not getting enough vitamin D, you're always going to feel down. You're not going to feel your best self. And boys, I added vitamin D into my Get Attractive. So don't worry about it.

Focusing all your attention in one goal is incredibly effective for your overall success. And I want to prove it to you in 30 seconds. I want to apply this rule in a simple and visual way. Most of you might feel inspired when you try something new like a drop shipping business. You'll sit down, you'll map out a plan, you start dreaming about all the things you'll achieve, right? The fancy car, the hot wife, you get it. But after a few days, that initial motivation starts to drop. Making all the work you have to do seem less appealing. This is what leads most to quit. So you jump onto something more exciting like day trading or maybe starting an agency. But you always end up in that same drop of motivation and anything you start. What I would tell my younger self is that success lies just beyond that drop in motivation. Whether it's building a business, getting fit or building a relationship with a great woman. You will always start with high motivation and then on drop. But then on the other side of that drop are all the rewards you ever wanted, which will create a positive feedback loop to keep you motivated. So the key is to pick one thing and stick with it long enough before you ever quit. So I want to give you a quick guide to this. If you're going to start a new business, make sure you make at least $10,000 before you decide to call it quits. If you're going to go to the gym, you have to make sure you go for at least six months consistently before you decide to quit. And if you're dating someone, and she's already your girlfriend, you have to date her for at least a year before you decide to break up. This is how you achieve real success that lasts. At this point, I've showed you some of my best life lessons I've learned over the decade. Sleeping at the right time to always feel energized. You read the right books at the right time. You're learning how to fake your confidence. Your looks maxing early so you look more attractive as you age. And now I've taught you how to stick to something long enough so you actually see success. Right. If you apply this now, you're going to crush everyone around you. Shoot, you're going to surpass me. And that's the point. But to truly maximize your progress, I've left my best two strategies for last. Number six, you're only going to listen to people who meet this criteria to be a man. You need to master three areas of your life. The physical, the financial, and the social. And when men try to improve these areas, they'll tend to do one of two things without realizing. There is a third method that beats both of them. The first guy will try to progress and do everything entirely on their own. And while that's admirable, it's not optimal. You're going to take a long time learning from all those mistakes. The second group will also work on their own, but they'll also seek advice from those around them. From close friends, close family. This actually ends up being worse than the first guy. Because if you're asking the wrong people and they don't know what they're doing, they're going to lead you down the path, a wrong path, which is going to take you longer to get to your goal. The third guy is the guy that takes the smart route. They will push themselves on their own, but they will use a specific criteria to only take advice that comes from high quality people. So I'm going to give you my criteria that I want you to apply to anyone that gives you advice. If it's advice on your physical, you should only take advice from men who have reached an advanced level. Whether it's with lifting weights or athletically like running, if it's financial, only take advice from men who have generated themselves, not from a job, but themselves, a hundred thousand dollars a year. And if it's social, you should only ask advice from a man who has been in a committed relationship with a woman for over a year. These are not just only good criteria or standards from who to get advice to, but man, these are also great goals for yourself to try to achieve. If I had used this criteria when I knew this younger, I would have saved myself a world of bad information. Finally, number seven, I want you to get high without ever using a drug. I love caffeine, but it's something that you should not rely on long term. You see, caffeine doesn't actually provide energy. It just makes you less sensitive to the feeling of tiredness by stealing energy away from your future reserves that you're going to need later. Instead, what you should do is boost your mood by doing the right exercises that boost the five feel good chemicals in your brain that literally give you a natural high. To produce dopamine, which is what makes you feel motivated. I want you to write down the work that you're going to do. And every time you complete the work, one of the exercises, I want you to tick it off. This year act of you just ticking an exercise off as you complete it will flood your mind with dopamine, motivating you to keep going. To produce serotonin, which is what makes you feel happy and balances your mood. I want you to go for a walk in nature, like in a park or in a bench, because nature has been scientifically proven to drastically increase serotonin levels. To produce more endorphins, which are your brain's natural pain relievers. Go for a 30 minute run because this physical activity will release endorphins, boosting your mood. To produce oxytocin, which is the bonding hormone or the social hormone. You always want to have a friend along or even your pet engaging in hugs, high fives, handshakes. All of this Cuban connection helps increase oxytocin to make you feel more connected. And finally, to produce more adrenaline, you should do something extremely challenging in your workout. For example, instead of going for a jog, change your workout to do 30 seconds of sprinting, followed by one minute of jogging. And repeat this for a total of 15 minutes. This intensity will give you an insane adrenaline boost. Now, if you want to do this all at once, grab a buddy, go to a park and do this high intensity sprint. And you're literally getting all five hormones from just doing this activity once a week. Now, you're high on life, you're not high on drugs, and you have natural motivation that'll keep you going. Bro, if you do every lesson I showed you now, especially that you're young, you're going to crush your competition and you're going to surpass and get to all your goals. At the end of the day, that's my goal for you, bro. See you at the top."

        "transcript": " Your Wager Art has started. Stop fucking doing that bro. You don't need a Wager Art. You just need to fix your life and today I'm going to give you a fit the easy things you can do. Turn your life around but just know by you just finishing this video you're signing a contract with yourself. A contract that comes with five specific terms that you must follow for the next 90 days. Contract term number one you need to start a mandatory cut or bulk and I'm going to show you 10 ways to do that. First I want you to go to a BMI calculator website. You can put all your information and then calculate. If you're overweight that means you need to start a mandatory cut. If you're underweight you need to start a mandatory bulk. Next you will visit a calorie calculator. You're going to input all your information and find your daily metabolic rate. If you're out of bulk you're going to eat 400 calories more than what it tells you. If you're in a cut you're going to eat 400 calories less than what it tells you. Number three you're going to step on the scale every morning. If you're bulky your goal should be to gain eight pounds every month or 3.6 kg. If you're cutting your goal should be to lose eight pounds or 3.6 kilograms every month. Number four make exercising the very first thing you do every morning during this winter art. Look if you're bulky you should be doing 45 minutes of weight training with 15 minutes of cardio. If you're cutting you need to be doing 30 minutes of weight training with 30 minutes of cardio. Five after each workout you must have a smoothie. If you're cutting you're going to do two scoops of a low carb protein but if you're bulking if you're boring you're still going to do two scoops but it's going to be a high carb protein. You have to choose the right products for your goals. If you're bulking go for the full fat options like full fat popcorn but if you're cutting go for the low fat versions of the same food so you can eat more of it without overeating on calories. For example you got skinny pop. Number seven I want you to do a dehydration check. Grab your finger and I want you to pinch that loose skin in the back. If it snaps back quickly you're hydrated but if it takes a while to snap back this means that you are dehydrated and you should be aiming for three liters of water or around six pints every single day to stay hydrated especially if you're working out during this bulk or cut. Number eight to maximize muscle growth. Stop looking for the pump or that burn. Yeah it feels good you think you're doing a lot but instead what you should be doing is focusing on sets that are between five and eight reps. With those last four reps taking you to absolute failure once you reach failure you want to give your body's central nervous system three minutes rest before you do it again. Number nine scientifically if you want to speed up muscle growth let me show you some. See you probably think when you do a lift that your muscle is growing when you do this movement it's not. Your muscle is growing the most here in this movement. This is the eccentric portion of the movement. I want you to find that eccentric portion of every lift that you do and focus on tonal control on that part and watch just how fast your muscle will grow. If you follow this first term of the contract and the 10 tips I just gave you on how to complete it it will completely change how you look but to completely change who you are you need to abide by the next four contract terms I'm about to give you. And finally number 10 you want to delay your last meal till 12 if you're cutting but never skip on breakfast if you're bored. Contract term number two give yourself a glow up to become unrecognizable. You're gonna start with the first step I want you to grab your body lotion and your favorite fragrance you're gonna open it up and you're gonna spray your favorite fragrance inside of your body lotion. What this is gonna do is it's gonna force you every day when you step out the shower and moisturize you're always gonna smell good no matter what. Number two you're gonna start washing your face with the face wash that contains hand thinning. Everybody likes to just buy any face wash but you never look at the ingredients. This one is important because it's a strong anti-inflammatory which is great for not only just cleansing your skin but also reducing any puffiness and any acne scars. This one has been feel confident and it's formulated by a doctor which is why the formulation on this is on point. It also feels amazing on the skin once you're done washing your face with an ingredient like this you're gonna see an immediate difference you do this for the rest of the Witcher art. Bro you're gonna look completely different. Three I want you to start oil pulling every day. Grab some sort of edible oil and a tablespoon you're gonna take a tablespoon of this and swish it around in your mouth for 10 minutes every morning. Now make sure you drink at least half a gallon or two liters of water every day to cleanse your body and have fresh freshful day and your teeth will get wider. Number four use a moisturizer every day that changes the color of your skin. Now the only moisturizers that do this are the ones that have vitamin C as it is great to regulate your melanin production and make your skin look brighter. But the best moisturizers have an ingredient called tetrahaxidicil absorbin. This is basically vitamin C but a more potent version where they extract the tetrahaxidicil this is the active ingredient that actually brightens your skin and create a more potent version inside of my moisturizer. This is a hat most guys don't know and when you apply this one from feel confident remember feel confident is great because everything is formulated by a doctor and this guy not only researches but makes sure that the formulation is on point to give you great looking skin so when you apply it as you can see it applies matte it looks great on your skin it dries quickly but it also will brighten your skin if you use it every single day. If you guys want to check out feel confident I'm gonna have it linked down below as well as the other face wash which I'm telling you will completely change how you look inside this winter art. Number five you will change how you shower depending the time updated. Look if it's the morning I want you to shower with cold water you want it to be anywhere around 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit around 10 to 15 degrees Celsius at least it's gonna tie in your skin and also wait you up to give you energy but if it's night time I want you to shower with warmer water between the 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit or between 37 and 42 degrees Celsius. This is going to open up your pores which is better for your skincare but also prepare your body for best so you can sleep better. Six use Vaseline to make your skincare products more effective. See after you've done applying your moisturizer and your eye cream for the day I want you to grab a little bit of Vaseline and apply it all over your face the Vaseline will basically seal in the moisture to keep that product as close as possible keeping your skin hydrated. Number seven before I get into the shower I want you to buy a shampoo that has soft palm metal. If I had a lot online you could also get it from feel confident which is the one that I showed you but soft palm metal has been scientifically proven to stop the production of DHT which is the hormone that causes hair loss. Try to save your trip from turkey bro and while we're at it replace your conditioner as well. This will be number eight you want your conditioner to contain something called Curcubita Teppo which is going to stop hair loss. This is a component from pumpkin seed oil. If you use that three times a week similar to soft palm metal it's been scientifically proven to help stop the production of DHT which is what we all get as men and why we end up losing our hair. So save yourself the trouble and just wash your hair and condition it with the right product that's achieved salt in the store. If you guys want to check out feel confident I'm going to have them linked down below. Top it to the shower with nine. I want you to place a clean towel over your pillow before you go to sleep. This way you'll prevent transferring any bacteria from the night before onto your face as what causes acne. In this you can easily wash every day. Number ten make sure you drink at least half a gallon or two liters of water every day to cleanse your body and clear your skin. Contract term number three you're going to eliminate all distractions and first you're going to start by going ghost on all your messaging platforms. You're going to turn off your red receipts and you're going to turn on your offline status so you always appear offline. No one should know when you're online and when you've seen that message. Next before you go to bed I want you to grab your iPhone go into settings then you're going to go accessibility then you're going to go into display and text size. Score all the way down and go into color filter. Once you're here turn it on go to color tint and intensify this. Turn your screen extremely red helping you block all sort of blue light which will negatively impact your screen but also reduce how much time you spend on your phone. It's no longer that pleasant. Three right before you go to sleep I want you to grab your phone and place it on the other side of your bed. When that thing rings you have no choice but to get up and get it. Four you're going to reduce your consumption of pornography down to 20% which means that if you usually watch it every day so for the next 10 days you can only watch it for two days because instead of trying to eliminate it what you won't do we're going to try to control the loss. Five use Parkinson's law to get everything done faster. If you have a job that will take you an hour give yourself 30 minutes on a timer. If it's supposed to take you two hours give yourself just one hour. Number six consume the right amount of caffeine. Look you got some guys that don't even consume confit at all while others consume way too much. Studies have found that if you want prime focus you need to be consuming between 50 and 100 milligrams of caffeine every day and just for reference every cup from Starbucks has around 60 milligrams of caffeine. Seven never work in bed and if you're going to work in your bedroom let's be real you're not going to focus bro if you're going to work go to a library a coffee shop or even your own living room. Number eight use the three minute rule. Anytime you have a task that you have to do that you hate like freaking cleaning nobody likes to clean bro tell yourself look I'm only going to back you for like three minutes and then you'll stop. This will get you over the hump of actually starting to do the thing and what you'll notice most of the time once you've started you'll actually finish the job. Number nine you're going to time block like the billionaires do specific hours every day. Let me show you every computer has this I want you to go to your calendar once you see your calendar block off three hour block just to work on your stuff so this could be get money this is just to work on your side hustle no one can disturb you in these three hours all you'll do is focus on that. Number ten allow yourself to play video games but avoid the top five most effective ones which are Fortnite League of Legends World of Warcraft Call of Duty and Candy Crush. At this point you're committing to a mandatory bulk or cut you're committing to a glow up and now you're committing to fully focusing on your goals but there are still two more rules in the contract you need to follow completely transform your life. It takes us to contract term number four you need to get rich in 90 days starting with step one the infinite money glitch what you're gonna do is make a list of all the brands you love you're gonna reach out to these brands as a micro influencer even if you only have like 2,000 followers you're gonna then tell them you will promote their brand for just their product most brands because they're not paying you will send you the product and they'll say yes so now you're gonna have a bunch of product where once you do the post you can grab that product and then resell it on a marketplace like ebay or facebook giving you an infinite money of new product that you sell that also builds up your brand. Number two try to cancel or reduce all your subscriptions bro if you don't need them cancel and if you do need them try to reduce the cost by getting onto a family plan with some friends for example if i were to just pay for spotify by myself it's 12 bucks but if i pay with the group of friends it's about three to four bucks each. Number three start using cash instead of your card and set a weekly budget i want you to remove all cards from your phone because studies show you physically handing in money reduces spending by 130 percent and four becoming over each driver but instead of driving around aimlessly turn on the app only when you're driving home from work or school you're only gonna accept orders during your drive effectively doubling your hourly rate and eliminating time wasted waiting on order. Number five instead of scrolling through tiktok every day why don't you scroll through facebook marketplace and just start low balling people like for iPhones for example if you don't ball 20 people eventually one of them is gonna say yes and then you can flip it for like 30 50 profit every day. Number six i want you to invest in an air fryer bro this thing is the easiest to use when you want to cook things it's gonna help you stay healthier stick to your bulk or cut and then you're gonna even save you money because you're gonna actually want to cook at home it's not that difficult. Number seven i want you to come to your room and make three piles donate keep and sell anything that you can't sell for over five bucks i should be your donate pile whatever looks good it makes you feel great you keep and everything else you sell to make extra cash. Number eight you will learn a new skill through youtube now this is simple once you have this skill you will reach out to three companies within your country and offer your skill for free this is just so you can get some experience then you will reach out to three more companies and now offer your skill for your country's minimum wage let's say your minimum wage is like ten dollars an hour once you get that you will do it again and reach out to three more companies but this time you're gonna double your minimum wage and now you're gonna i ask for twenty dollars an hour and you will continue to do this until you see these businesses no longer respond which means that is the most you can charge but now you're making three four five times minimum wage and you're getting better at that skill. Number nine pretend to cancel all your subscriptions sorry about that no yeah just wanted to cancel this it's just it's just getting way too expensive and i have too many subscriptions anyways um i see that you're a value customer how about if i offer you 50% off in the next month um it doesn't sound so bad can you do two months at that price can you know what we value your business um how about do the next four months uh 50 that sounds great this guy we're the again is learning negotiation skills do that with every subscription service now you're gonna take all that money all that extra money you just saved because of what i've showed you and you're gonna invest it into the s and p 500 because you'll never beat the market but if you're in the market that's when you're really making money in the long run contract rule number five do not date or chase any women during this art you need to completely remove yourself from women in a romantic set however you don't need to completely stop talking to them which takes us to the first step read books that help you understand women forever like no more mr nice guy or the way of the superior man number two stop asking girls advice of how to get girls well they've never done it so they have zero success to back it up you should instead ask that one guy that's semi-ugly but is always on dates number three you're tender but do it efficiently instead of swiping all day on tender don't do that just like 10 times then reset the or close the app to reset the algorithm and get off for a few hours then when you log back in the algorithm will put your most likely matches at the top saving you time number four you're gonna implement a no talking to girls time block this means let's say from the hours of 8 a.m to 2 p.m and then 4 p.m to 8 p.m you're not going to talk to girls this is not only going to help you keep you focused but also they're making more desirable number five anytime you meet out a girl out in public i want you to approach her and ask her something along the lines of what is your ethnicity then when she before she responds follow up i say oh because i thought you were x but when you say that make it some random ethnicity for example if she looks latina say oh i thought you looked dutch that's gonna remove any awkwardness immediately and get you right into a conversation it looks every time number six make it a rule to stop complimenting girls for the next three months yo girls already get a bunch of compliments you're not doing it it's gonna make you look different and then she's gonna start wondering why you're not even complimenting her which will make her think about you more number seven if you don't often meet girls out in public you can go to sites like omegle to talk to girls from all around the world to build your practice you can even ask for their instagrams and that way you start building up your instagram profile following and being followed by a bunch of attractive girls number eight i need you to make a list and think about what you want in a future wife or girlfriend that way you can stay focused and stop chasing low quality women for example you don't want to go posting on holy fans that dream survives that goes out every weekend or is posting with a different guy at her stories every day number nine remove any girl on your social media that likes to post half naked to avoid distractions number ten finally replace all interview questions like where are you from what do you study with more in-depth and interesting questions like why did you choose to study eck and go to this university did you like it or how come you chose that university instead of the one closer to you at home you have now waited till the end by doing so you have signed the contract and the five terms you need to agree to for the next 90 days i promise you you're gonna change your life"

        "transcript": " When you invest in the stock market, your investment grows and then you pay dividends from it. The same is true for yourself. So today, I'm going to show you six hard skills that if you learn now will pay you forever. Starting with number one, learn to pick your friends using the social theory exchange. Before you make friends with anybody, you should evaluate them on this chart I'm about to give you to know if they're a good person or a bad person. To use this social exchange theory, you need to weight the potential rewards from that relationship versus the amount of energy you put into it. If that balance tips in your favor, they are worth your time and energy. If that, you should not be friends with them. And here's how you're going to apply it yourself. First, think of any friend you have and look at all the positive traits I have on screen right now and count how many of those does that friend have. Now, I want you to do the exact same thing for that same friend with the negative traits you see on screen right now. Now, take the number of positive traits that friend has and subtract the number of negative traits that same friend has. If their score is less than zero, bro, that's a low quality friend and you shouldn't be investing your energy into them. If they score between zero and five, look, you can see them here and there may be on weekends but avoid trying to spend all your time with them. However, if they score above a five, bro, that should be one of your best friends. They should be in your intimate circle and spend as much time as you can with them. This skill alone is going to pay you massive dividends for the rest of your life. But that is still nothing compared to the next five hard skills I'm about to teach you. Number two, replace everything you're used to doing in the mornings. Look, there's no perfect morning routine. There's only things you should and shouldn't be doing. If you do the right things, your mind and your body will pay you back a lifetime. If you do the wrong things, your mind and body will tax you for the rest of your life. So to keep it simple, don't wake up with an alarm clock. Do wake up with the alarm on your phone on a soft ringtone. A loud alarm is proven to spike cortisol, which is going to stress you out in the mornings. Don't make your bed. Do just unfold it. If you tuck the left side correctly and only lift up the right side as you sleep in the mornings, you just have to unfold it back and you're right out the door. Don't start your day with coffee. Do wait 90 minutes before you take caffeine or start your day with water and lemon. Don't check your social media as this is going to lead to you just doom scrolling in the mornings. Do check your emails and texts so you can be prepared for the day. Don't shower for 30 minutes every morning. Do quickly rinse off using the Navy shower technique. Number three, learn to get rid of motivation. As a man, the most important hard skill you can learn early is to get rid of motivation. You see, every time you start something new, like a hobby or a new girl, you have a phenomenon called the overcommitment effect. In the beginning, you overcommit yourself so much because of the motivation, you quickly burn out, which in turn always leads to bad or weak results. Instead, you need to start off slow in anything you do so you can sustain yourself and actually deliver better results. And all of it will be through discipline and not motivation. The best example of this that's simple is skincare. Most people will ignore their skincare for years and the moment they get a zit or wrinkles, they try to overhaul it with 15 different products to try to fix it overnight. But in reality, you just need three steps and you need to start slow. First, you need a good face wash and make sure it has psilocylic acid. Silicic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that penetrates deep into the skin, which in turn helps all clogged pores and prevent breakouts. This is why you need it in your face wash. In fact, studies show that psilocylic acid not only helps get rid of acne, but it also helps prevent future breakouts. Now, the best face wash I've ever used is from Geology and that's for a reason. I've been using it for five years now because they've won every single award you can think of from Men's Health Men's Journal as one of the best grooming brands in the market. Geology delivers all the basic products guys need. They don't overcomplicate things, but they deliver it with the right formulation. Their everyday face wash has 2% psilocylic acid and it is hands down the best one you're going to find in the market to get rid of acne without breaking the bank. Especially because you're coming from your boy and I get you a 70% discount bro. So if you want to level it off, click the link in the bio so you can get that code and check out Geology. The second step, you need a good moisturizer. However, this one should contain hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, which basically means it attracts moisture from the environment and retains it close against your skin. In fact, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. This is why it's so good at keeping your skin hydrated and looking amazing. One study published in the National Library of Medicine found that if you use hyaluronic acid regularly, it improves skin appearance and remove fine lines and wrinkles. And of course, I'm going to recommend Geology as the best moisturizer because there's a lot of the market, but they're expensive, especially when they have hyaluronic acid. But Geology's moisturizer has hyaluronic acid and it's crazy affordable, especially if you use a 70% discount on getting you. It's the most affordable one you'll find and this one also won an award for already being one of the best ones in the market. So it's not only that it's affordable, you're getting the best quality you can find. Plus, it also has SPF protection. So when you use it every day, you're not only hydrating your skin, you're also protecting your skin from the sun's higher for rays. And the cool thing with Geology is that it gets delivered to your door every month. So once you subscribe, you're getting a crazy discount. Plus, you can have a skincare system that gets delivered to your door easily. And the last step you need in your three-step system is retinol. Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A. This is one of the most well-researched ingredients in skincare. It works by stimulating collagen production, which is the protein responsible for keeping your skin tight. Yes, Geology does have a retinol cream because I'm going to make it easy for you, but I'm not going to send you to three different brands. That is a headache. If you want one brand that's not expensive and gives you everything you need, it's always Geology. I'm going to have Geology linked down below, plus a 70% discount code. Grab those three products I just mentioned. Build your skin routine. Start slow and watch just how much your skin's going to improve. If you guys want to check it out, it will be linked down below. Number four, stop reading self-help books. You need to stop trying to read all the self-help books everybody recommends to you. Instead, find one, two, or three that are really good and then read them over two, three, four times. The reason for this is that when you get self-help books, for you to truly understand the concepts and retain that information, you sometimes have to read them three to four times. So, to make it easy, if you don't know where to start, I'm going to give you the five books you should read at least three times over. To master the basics of personal finance, you should read The Richest Man in Babylon. To master your mind and build resilience, you should read Can't Hurt Me. To master social situations, you should read The Loss of Human Nature. To master your emotions and always stay in control, you should read the four agreements. And to master your body to build an aesthetic physique, read the Squat Bible. At this point, all of those skills, if you implement them today, will pay you for the rest of your life. But there are two more and I left these two for last because if you apply these, bro, your brother is setting you up forever. Number five, replace multitasking with single-tasking. Multitasking is going to make you lazy and forgetful. Single-tasking will make you focused and productive and know it's not just my opinion, this is science. During a recent study, researchers had 46 young men perform multiple tasks, such as working out and solving math equations. The researchers then analyzed how effective they were at completing the tasks in short-term memory. They then had them repeat the tasks, but this time doing them at the same time. And here's what they found. When men focused on a single task instead of multitasking, they improved both their short-term and long-term memory, as well as their reaction time and their ability to focus. In short, single-tasking makes you more effective than multitasking does. So, I want to show you five areas in your life that you're probably multitasking and you should it. When you're studying, you usually listen to music with lyrics. Don't do that. When working out, you usually listen to podcasts. Don't do that. When reading, you like to check your phone and read your notifications as well. Don't do that. When you're working and you're focused, you also like to be checking your emails. Don't do that. And finally, when you're talking to someone, you'll usually have your phone on the table as well, so you can keep an eye on it. You don't want to do that. You learn to single-task and that one hard skill is going to pay you forever. Number six, schedule your day using the Harvard Timeboxing Technique. There is a hundred different productive techniques you can use, but according to Harvard, there's only one that is truly powerful. It's called timeboxing. In fact, it is so powerful, it is what almost every single billionaire uses every day. And here's how you can do it too. First, you can grab a sheet of paper or create a template on an online document. Then you're going to create three columns, top priorities, brain dump and time frame. Next, I want you to write down everything you wish to complete in the brain dump column. Then I need you to write down everything you must complete in the top priorities column. And then in the time frame column, you're going to plan out how you're going to complete your top priorities and then you're going to schedule them around your needs. Doing this will pay you for the rest of your life because you will efficiently use your energy and time to complete everything you set your mind to. You do everything I taught you in this video, bro. I'm setting you up for life. They may seem like simple habits, but implement them for the next week and just watch how your life just gets easier."

        "transcript": " When it comes to grooming, you have three types of guys. First, you got Diddy. Nah, I'm just playing bro. First, you got the type of guys that don't even groom themselves. For you, just stay in this video, you need it. The second type of guy, they groom themselves in the morning but they use the exact same techniques at night. They look good. You could look better if you do what the third guy does, which is using the correct nighttime grooming techniques. So today, I'm gonna show you the nighttime grooming techniques you need to do to look more attractive. Get started. Number one, change how you shower at night. When you shower at night, you gotta do it differently than when you shower in the morning. This nighttime shower method is not only gonna give you better skin, it's also gonna help you sleep better. So to start, you're gonna get into the shower and I want you to set it to around a 106 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius. This heat is exactly enough to wash up the bacteria off your body without damaging your skin but also to prepare your body for sleep. To look to sleep well at night, your body keeps it dropped around one to two degrees at its core temperature. So what most men do is they assume, oh, let me just turn the water into cold to do that. But that's not how it works. You see, the surface of your body will stimulate the central nervous system, causing blood and heat to rust to your core, which is just gonna arrange your body's temperature. This is not what you want. This is why I want you to use warm water because on the other hand, warm water will decrease your body's temperature. Your body will try to cool down by cooling the heat from the inside towards the outside, which is gonna drop your core body temperatures and prepare you for a better night's sleep. All right, I fixed your shower routine, which means that your hair, your skin, and your sleep will start being better than ever before. But to truly look more attractive, I want you to do these next six grooming steps I'm about to show you. Two, you're washing your face incorrectly at night. You see, most guys will wash their faces at, they'll grab any old product and then they just start scrubbing their face. This does nothing because you need to understand that your face needs a different type of face wash at night. You see, according to a meta analysis in the library of health, our skin follows a sleep cycle very similar to our circadian rhythm. The study found that our skin becomes more permeable in the evening, which means that our skin is better able to absorb the ingredients during the nighttime. Because of this, that means that the face wash you use at night, like the one that I'm using right now, should contain ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin E, and glycolic acid. Now, instead of just applying your face wash and forgetting about it, I want you to take a step further. I want you to turn your water into a temperature between 98 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit or 36 and 40 degrees Celsius. This is the perfect temperature to open up your pores and really allow those nutrients to absorb. Scientists believe that your skin becomes more permeable at night, due to the increase in blood flow that happens through your body throughout the day. So at nighttime, this is prime time to get perfect skin. Now, you're gonna start washing your face slowly, using circular motions while you move upwards. Remember, I would suggest you stay here for about two minutes, because right now, my skin is absorbing all the nutrients. This is essential to truly wake up, looking like a stud next day, bro. Number three, stop making these three body-shaving mistakes. Look, most men know that if you shave yourself, you're gonna look more ripped. But if you're making the mistakes I'm about to show you, you're not only gonna cut your skin, but you're gonna be dealing with ingrown hairs, which is a problem. So, you're three body-shaving mistakes, you're probably making, and how to fix them. First, stop shaving against the grain. I get it. You want the closest shave possible that you don't have to reshape, and shaving against the grain seems to get the job done. But this increases your chances of getting ingrown hairs. If you deal with ingrown hairs, you have three options to get rid of this. First, you can just shave with the grain. This is gonna minimize most of your ingrown hairs. Next, if you wanna minimize it even more, shave with the grain and then exfoliate your body. You can use the same exfoliator we just made, as this will prevent any sort of ingrown hairs. And third, a technique that I recommend, that I've been using a lot, it's called the IPL. This is an IPL machine, or intense pulsating light. This machine literally gives you a pulsating light that removes hair, almost like laser hair removal, except you can do it from your home. All you gotta do is simply turn it on, you can hear the fan, you place it over your skin, or wherever you're trying to remove hair, and then you just press the button. Then an intense light, I don't know if you heard that. It doesn't hurt at all, literally you can't even feel it. That intense light is basically like laser hair removal from your house, and these things are crazy affordable. Now the second body shaving mistake is that you keep using dull blades. And this is both to traditional razors and even electric ones. The more you use them, the taller that blade gets, which leads to ineffective hair removal, the easiest fix. On top of replacing your blades regularly, is to buy blades that are made from 316 or three or four stainless steel. These are way more durable and they last longer. For electric razors, you need to be cleaning that trimmer after every use, and replace that head every six months. And you're probably surprised, because most guys don't know you have to replace the head of an electric trimmer as well. This is why, honestly, I think the most cost effective way to deal with body hair is the IPL system. Ditch the blades and get one like I have. This is from ULIK. ULIK has won a bunch of awards for their IPL machine. You can go to their website, they have several, but they're considered one of the best at home, intense pulsating systems. But the cool part is that you buy this once, there's no replacements, you don't have to be replacing anything, you don't have to deal with ingrown hairs, and you pretty much get permanent hair removal-like results from the comfort of your home, and you can do whatever you want. And lastly, you're shaving areas of your body that you should be trimming. Look, there are certain areas, even if you get everything right of your body, you should never put a shave rod. Or your armpits, such as your private areas. Because the regrowth process is extremely uncomfortable, plus it's so easy to nick yourself. That's why in these areas, you should always trim with the clip guard to always stay safe and avoid that uncomfortable regrowth. But at the end of the day, bro, make sure you're not making any mistakes, because you can use this in every part of your body, private, face, anywhere. It's 100% safe, there are no damages, there are no ingrown hairs, you don't have to replace anything, and it lasts longer than every other hair removal process. And you're doing it from your home. Bro, this is the most cost-efficient way, and your body is gonna look jacked. If you guys wanna check out this IPO system to better manage your body hair, I'm gonna have it linked down below with a special discount. You guys wanna check it out, it'll be linked down below. Four, renew your skin with an at-home exfoliant. You should always exfoliate your skin at night and never in the morning. Because at night is when your skin's cellular turnover is at its best, which basically means you're literally replacing your old skin with new skin as you sleep. However, most exfoliants suck, they have a lot of ingredients and the good ones are way too expensive. So, I'm gonna show you how to do a natural one at home that's gonna last you for months, and it's cheap to do. First, I want you to grab this 20 ounce tub of coconut oil. This is cheap, you can get it at a supermarket. You're gonna pour this into a bowl, and then microwave that bowl until the coconut oil turns into liquid. Once done, I want you to put half a cup of sugar into that same bowl once it's melted, and I want you to mix it well. After a few hours, I want you to then pour that back into the jar and then let it sit for a few hours. After a few hours, the oil's gonna solidify, and now you've created an exfoliant that's gonna last you months. The best part is it's all natural. So, when you're in the shower, grab a good amount, and you can put it all over your face and body anywhere you deal with acne, right before you go to bed. Five, you're in the 10 grooming and hygiene essentials that every guy should own in their bathroom. One, a high quality pair of tweezers. Two, a high quality fingernail clipper for both your toes and your nails. Three, a straight razor. Not the cheap five blades, the straight razor. Four, electric floss for cleaning in between your teeth. Five, an electric toothbrush to keep fresh breath and white teeth. Six, a silicone facial scrubber. You should not be using your hands to wash your face. Seven, a silicone body scrubber. Eight, a tongue scraper for removing all that white gunk on your tongues. My electric floss has a tongue scrape in the back, but if yours doesn't, you should have to. Nine, is a high quality beard trimmer, some that come to the clip guard, that has multiple size settings. And 10, the IPL machine, I'm telling you. Since I added this into my grooming routine, it's been a game changer, bro. I no longer have to be shaving my body here, because this IPL machine is basically laser at home that doesn't hurt and has no side effects. It's one of the greatest tools a man can have in their bathroom arsenal. And if you guys wanna check out that IPL machine from you like, like I said, it'll be linked down below with a special discount. Number six, I want you to start using my night time sleep routine. One bad night of sleep can take you from attractive to unattractive. So, here are my top three bedroom essentials to make your room better for sleeping, and they cost nothing to do. The very first thing I do is I set my temperature at 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18 degrees Celsius. The reason I started doing this is because of a study conducted out of Sweden. Researchers took pictures of 23 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 31 after they had eight hours of good sleep. Next, I like to duct tape all the small little lights that are coming out of my room. So my room is pitch black, and then I try to limit eating water intake at least one hour before going to bed. That way I don't have to be waking up in the middle of the night to go to use the restroom. Because when the researchers took pictures of those same participants, I just showed you, 31 hours later after they had been sleep deprived. So just one day of bad sleep. They showed them before and afters to a group of 65 individuals. So they can rate each picture of attractiveness. On average, that second picture was rated substantially worse than the first one. That's just one night of bad sleep. That's why you need this sleep routine. So the final step you should do is what I did. I invest in high quality bedding and don't replace your home mattress. Literally you just need to buy either silk or bamboo sheets. They are super cheap on Amazon, but the reason for this is that they're antibacterial. So you won't get any transfer of bacteria to your skin, and they feel insanely soft against your skin. So you sleep, bro, I sleep like a baby. But think about it, bro, this nighttime routine I just showed you, you're showering with the right temperature. So your body is prepared for bed. You're using an at-home exfoliate that helps your skin repair overnight. Your body's gonna look ripped. You're using the right face wash at night to absorb more nutrients. You have the right tools you need to groom yourself. And now you've prepped your room to get your best night sleep. Everything you've done up to this point is so by tomorrow, you wake up looking completely different. But there's one last thing I want you to do. Do not make these final nighttime grooming mistakes. I'm gonna tell you this right before I go to bed. The best grooming tips are not actually the products you put on your face, but instead the habits that keep you attractive. So here are the four best ways to wake up looking amazing. First, if possible, use some mouth tape to put over your mouth, to prevent snoring, but also to prevent you from breathing out of your mouth as you sleep, which over time, it weakens your jawline. Second, if you have long hair, make sure you wash out all the product out of your hair before you go to bed so that product doesn't transfer onto your skin. Third, never have any dark chocolate, green tea, coffee, or soda before bed. All of these are packed with caffeine and it's gonna mess up your REM sleep, which in turn, tomorrow, it means you're gonna wake up with bags under your eyes. And fourth, after you brush your teeth, I don't want you to drink anything, including water. As doing so, you're gonna remove all the ingredients from the toothpaste that are supposed to stay on your teeth to make them wider overnight. If you follow every step out of this late night grooming routine, I promise you, you will look 10 times better than you already do. You already look good, bro. I'm just trying to help out."

        "transcript": " Sex is amazing, but no one ever teaches you how it works. More importantly, how to use it. So in today's video, I'm gonna have to play your daddy, and I'm gonna do exactly that so you don't end up becoming obsessed with it for the wrong reasons. Where most people go wrong with sex is when they think about it. They only think about what's physically happening in between their legs. However, if you were to actually scan your body, you would realize that the real action is what's happening in between your ears. And this happens way before physical interaction. In fact, there are actually five steps that need to occur before sex can commence. Step one, I call this the starting zone. This process of sex begins the moment you see someone you find attractive. This is a phenomenon that scientists refer to as the pleasure principle. During this initial stage, your heart rate will increase by anywhere between five and 15 beats per minute, which elevates the hormone cortisol. And this hormone cortisol is what elevates that familiar butterfly in your stomach feeling. Soon after, your body will start releasing dopamine and serotonin, which are hormones that affect your brain similar to cocaine. This is why you feel that strong urge that every time you see that like, fine, that baddie, you just have to look at her. Because it's similar to taking a hit of cocaine, bro. It's that addicting. It's like, it gives us dudes a natural high. But this rolls us to part two. What I call the risk zone. When it comes to choosing someone to have sex with, women are way more pickier. And it's easy to think that women are shallow because of this. But in reality, their pickiness comes because sex comes with four major risks for them. The risk of pregnancy, which demands a huge amount of energy and resources. The second risk is childbirth, which can be life threatening and expensive. The third risk is raising a child, which requires years of intensive care and attention. And the fourth risk is that women are more likely to become infertile if they come into contact with sexually transmitted diseases. But rather than just me telling you that women are pickier when choosing their sex partner, let me show you. In 2015, there was this video by the channel called Whatever, where they went out and asked a hundred guys for sex. It was a social experiment. In the video, an attractive woman approached a hundred men and asked them directly if they wanted to have sex with her. At the end of the video, 29 men said yes and 70 said no. This channel repeated the experiment, except this time they had an attractive man approaching a hundred women. In this case, not one single woman said yes, further demonstrating that sex involves way too much risk for them. Now, what's interesting in this video is that a lot of women actually considered the offer before they said no. This shows that women may not be as open to have sex with somebody right there at the spot. They definitely think about sex as much as you and I do. And why wouldn't they? Sex is one of the most pleasurable experiences on the planet, but before I dive deeper, I need to first break down for you their biological checklist. This takes us to part three, what I call the checklist zone. Because of the risks associated with sex and pregnancy, women have a biological checklist that almost all of them have that determine if a man is worthy to have sex with. The higher the quality the woman you're chasing is, the more criteria on this checklist she's gonna require. Now, this checklist includes three points. The first one is protection. Now, the fastest way to show that you're a protector, get muscle, lift heavy weights three times a day, and pick some sort of martial arts like Brazilian jujitsu or boxing. And to maximize your muscle growth, start taking natural supplements like iron. You just need 10 micrograms of iron every day. And this increases the red blood cells in your body, helping transfer more oxygen into your muscles so your muscles can be healthier. Iron you can buy separately in a singular bottle, but it's also in our new get attractive supplement, which is a supplement that's fully geared and giving you the vitamins you need to look as attractive as possible. Guess what? This one includes 14.5 micrograms of iron that I take daily. The second biological checklist is resources. In today's world, that means money. So to demonstrate resources on a girl you just met, you wanna dress well, you wanna wear jewelry, and you should always pace for that first date. And the third checklist is attractiveness. Now, to appear as attractive as possible, you should be eating healthy. You should be getting a haircut every two weeks, and you should be dressing better. And you should maintain a skincare routine. And if you listen to me with supplements, take the supplements that contain the holy trinity of skincare. This would be biotin, vitamin E, and vitamin B6, which of course, you can get separately. When you combine these three, it gives your skin everything it needs, from protection from the sun, moisturizing within, and giving you clear, acne-free skin. This is why you need to be taking supplements to look better. Women do it, but no one does it for men, which is why I created get attractive that launched this month. It is the first time we launched. Now, you could just try one bottle. I recommend you take this for two months, and you're gonna see a noticeable difference in your skin and in your hair. It's gonna make you more attractive. But if you believe in your brother, and all the work he put into the supplement, and you subscribe and receive this monthly, I'm gonna give you a gift for trusting me. I'm gonna give you 20% off right now, and you're gonna have that 20% off for the rest of your life. And with this new company, Get Supplements, I'm gonna be dropping supplements every two months, a new supplement. Because you were one of the first believers in this brand, and are truly trying to make yourself look more attractive. I'm gonna give you that supplement for free for the rest of your life. You're gonna be grandfathered in. So every time we drop a new supplement, you're gonna get that free bottle in your subscription. That's insane, bro. Like, I'm never gonna do this offer again, and this offer will expire October 31st. We're just doing this for this month of October, which is the month that we launched. After this, you will never see this offer again. So if you want to, subscribe, and pick up Get Attractive to look as attractive as possible. But once you've met the criteria that girl wants from you, you're gonna eventually move on to the act of sex. This is the moment where most men misunderstand the purpose of sex, and how to approach it, which takes me to part four, the act of sex. As a matter of fact, let me show you how to have sex. Bro, why are you still watching, man? I'm not gonna show you how to have sex, bro. When it comes to sex, most of you, you guys are gonna fall into three categories. The first type of man, they want sex, but they're too scared to talk to a girl, so they're never gonna leave stage one. These are the type of men that end up having these dark, twisted fantasies that can usually only be fulfilled online. Now you have the second type of man, where they validate their entire worth around sex. And so, this is the dude that tries to get as much sex as he possibly can. He skips all the stages he can. He skips all the stages of sex right into stage four, which is the act of sex, and ends up sleeping with a bunch of low-quality women. But then, there is a select small group of men, which is the third group of them, which I'm assuming is all of you boys, that see sex for what it is, which is energy. You see, sex produces a ton of hormones that make us feel good, like dopamine and serotonin. But more importantly, it also produces hormones, like oxytocin and narrow-pinephrine, these deep, these scientifically that we have with the person that we're having sex with. The problem, however, is that there's only so much of these two hormones that we can produce. This means that if you were to only ever have sex with one person in your life, all of those hormones would go into deepening your relationship with them, and only them. Now, compare that to the dude that decides to sleep with 10 women, and then he decides to commit to just one. He's gonna have all these strings of attachment, pulling at his focus for the rest of his life, making it difficult, and in some cases, impossible, to truly ever commit and be the man he needs to be for his partner. In fact, a study found that if you only had sex with the person that you married, your chances of divorce are 5%. But if you just had sex with one person outside of your marriage, those chances of divorce jumped to 22%. The reason is that as you sleep with more people, you're diminishing your ability to connect with somebody that you love. This is why. If you're gonna have sex with someone, it's crucial to do it with someone that's worth it. Look, by this point, you understand the purpose of sex, the risks associated with sex for women, the checklists that they're gonna put you through, and the risks of sleeping with multiple women. But you're missing one last stage of sex, you call part five. Intimacy is the secret to success. As I've gotten older, I've realized that intimacy is the most important thing a man can have. So I'm gonna show you what that means. And why your goal is to be with just one woman and how to achieve that. First, intimacy only develops when a woman knows both the good and the bad sides of you and still chooses to stay. This is the most powerful connection you will ever experience with a woman, like having a true rider die. However, that true intimacy is only gonna emerge if you allow yourself to be vulnerable with this girl. And that vulnerability is only possible when you fully commit to her. If you find a high quality woman and you commit to her, these are the five immediate benefits you can expect. You're gonna have increased focus and energy throughout the day. More motivation as you now have a purpose, reduced depression, anxiety, and stress, improved confidence and self-esteem, and even a stronger immune system to fight off sicknesses. This, boys, it is the chico to truly becoming a powerful man. This is essential. Just take a look at billionaires like Phil Knight, the creator of Nike, Bill Gates, the creator of Microsoft. They are extraordinarily successful in their own right. And all these men, they have one thing in common. They were married to one woman, their whole ride up to success. In reality, sex is a great drug. And if you use it wisely with the right woman, it can fuel you with the level of motivation you never thought was possible. But if you waste it on low quality women you don't care about, it will prevent you from ever reaching your potential. All right, daddy lesson done. The choice is now yours. See you boys next time."

        "transcript": " Yo, if you want healthy teeth and a great smile, you gotta do 3 things. Keep your breath fresh, keep them clean and keep them white. So today, I'm gonna show you how to keep your teeth healthy by giving you 2 tips to complete each of those. It started. Step 1, let's keep your breath fresh. Look, most girls, you might not even notice your yellowish teeth, but they work for a fat. Notice if you breath steak, so here are 2 ways to have fresh breath. You have to use the right toothpaste for your teeth. Most people think, oh, I'm just gonna brush my teeth twice a day and I'm gonna have fresh breath. Wrong bro, this is not gonna work. Instead, you need a toothpaste that contains the right ingredients for your specific teeth. So here's how to test if you have bad breath and then how to find the right toothpaste for your teeth. Alright, first, I want you to come into your kitchen and grab a spoon. You're gonna place this bottom part on your tongue like that and then you're gonna hold it there for 2 minutes. Afterwards, I want you to smell your... I'm scared bro, your boy always asks for his breath. I want you to smell your spoon. If that thing stinks, it means that your mouth has way too much bacteria, which means the toothpaste you should use should contain antibacterial ingredients like trichlacin or fluoride. Next, I want you to go into your freezer and grab an ice cube. I want you to grab my ice. I want you to place it right on your front teeth. Hold it there for like 10 seconds. If you can't withstand that coldness against your teeth, it means your teeth are too sensitive and you should look for a toothpaste that contains desensitizing agents like potassium nitrate. Number 2, eat these 5 foods to keep your breath fresh. Look, every dentist always tells you what foods to avoid for a healthy teeth and good breath but they never tell you when you should be eating. So to keep it simple, here's a list of my favorite foods that will help clean your mouth and keep your breath fresh. The first one is apples. You see, the crunchiness of apples help increase saliva production, which washes away food particles and neutralizes acids in the mouth. The second is mint. No, there is a reason why most toothpaste have mint in it. It just smells fresh but it also has antimicrobial properties that helps neutralize any bad smelling bacteria. So I love adding mint to my teeth. The third is oranges. They're packed with vitamin C which strengthen your gums. While the natural acidity clears away plaque without causing damage to your teeth. Fourth is green tea. The tea contains catches that kill bacteria in your mouth, preventing plaque buildup and bad breath. And fifth is watermelon. Because just like apples, watermelon stimulates the level of production in your mouth, which helps wash away food particles. So if you just incorporate one or two of these into your daily diet, you're going to have clean your teeth and freshen your breath without having to be chewing gum all the time. Now by this point, you're using the right toothpaste for your teeth and now eating great foods that'll give you fresh breath. Bro, immediately you're going to have a better smile, bro. But remember, if you truly want to have the most attractive smile possible, there's still two things you need. Clean teeth and white teeth. Shows us out to part number two. Step two, clean your teeth. See now that you've taken care of like the worst offender, nobody likes bad breath. You now need to understand how to properly clean your teeth. Which takes us to number three. I want you to brush your teeth using the four quadrant technique. Everyone tells you you should brush your teeth twice a day, but they never explain to you how to do it properly. So your boy is going to show you first, imagine your mouth divided into four sections. You have the upper left, upper right, bottom left and bottom right quadrant. You'll start by angling your toothbrush at a 45 degree angle towards your gum line. So then you're going to start on the upper left section of your mouth using small circular motions to remove all the plaque buildup from your gum line and in between your teeth. You're going to spend 10 seconds on the outside of the tooth, 10 seconds on the inside of the tooth, and then 10 seconds on the bottom of the teeth. You're going to then repeat the process for all other three quadrants in your mouth with the entire process taking around two minutes. By the end, you will have removed bacterial causing bad breath while also removing all the plaque that ends up staining your teeth giving you that yellow look. For real, you're going to remove bad breath forever by flossing like a dentist. Because everyone thinks, oh if I brush my teeth and I floss correctly, I should have great teeth right now. You won't. Not if you don't learn how to floss. And there's three steps to floss like a dentist. First, you need to pick up either waxed or unwaxed floss. Waxed floss is thicker and stronger. However, they have PFA or forever chemicals on them so I don't recommend it. What I recommend is unwaxed floss. It has no chemicals. It's thinner so it's easier to maneuver it between your teeth and really get all the dirt out. Now, if you really want to have the best smile ever, bro, level up to an electric flosser. I picked this electric flosser up a few months ago. It is a complete game changer. It has unwaxed floss, I made sure of that. But the high frequency vibration, bro, I'm getting dirt and plaque out of in between my teeth that I was never getting before. This one is from a company called Slate Game Changer. Now that you have your floss, you need to learn how to do it correctly. Like a dentist. So to do that, you need to take out about 30 centimeters of floss of unwaxed floss. You will then wind it around both your index fingers and you're going to use your thumbs to stabilize the floss. Here's the key. When you go in between your teeth, go along the curve of your tooth and not just up and down. You want to get the plaque out of all of that. Now, if you've never flossed like this before, it will be painful at times, especially your first couple of times. But that's also why I recommend an electric flosser better. Because this floss is so finely woven, you can almost see how thin that is. It allows me to get in there deeper without causing any bleeding or damage. And the cool part is that the flosser has three vibration settings that help floss your teeth and all the duck out better while also massaging your gums. This is crucial because it is that leftover plaque and bacteria that you're leaving in there that's causing you the bad breath or causing it to grow in stain your teeth. Now finally, you want to finish by the one flossing step. Everyone skips. You want to scrape your tongue. So once you still have your floss and again, you stabilize with your toes, you will rub this down your tongue to remove all white gunk. Go as deep as you can and move forward. That white gunk is what causes 90% of the bad breath. Now if you listen to your older brother and pick up the electric flosser, you can actually skip this step because the flosser comes with the tongue straight by the back and because it's super charged with vibrations, it does a way better job at scraping your tongue. So if you want the version that's going to give you the best smile possible and the freshest breath possible, you guys need to check out this flosser by Slate. I'm telling you, it is a game changer that most men don't know about. It's like a secret weapon, bro. If you guys want to check it out, it'll be linked down below with a special discount. It's going to make it way more affordable than anybody else that checks this out. Now we move on to step three, which is white in your teeth. Step number three, we're back in the kitchen because now we're going to white our teeth here and out of the bathroom. See, you've already removed your bad breath with the right toothpaste, eating the right booth. You've cleaned your teeth properly using the four quadrant technique and the right floss. But now it's the most important step of all. This is what everyone sees. I want you to have a good smile. I want you to be white, bro. So to do that, we're going to move on to number five, use sugar to whiten your teeth. Look, the best thing for your teeth is sugar, but not just any sugar. I want you to use a sugar replacement called xylitol. Xylitol is a sugar substitute that's often used in baking to make foods healthier. But what many don't realize is that it can also help your teeth look wider by strengthening your enamel. This is what reduces plaque buildup and increases the whiteness of your teeth. So we're technically going to use a sugar substitute to make your teeth whiter. So to use xylitol in your dental routine, you're going to do three things. First, I want you to go to your local store and buy sugar-free gum. If you look at the ingredients, they almost always replace sugar with xylitol as the main ingredient. Second, you can eat foods rich in xylitol. There's a lot of natural ones like strawberry, pumpkin, and cauliflower. And finally, I want you to replace your toothpaste to also include xylitol in its ingredient. If you start adding this across all three aspects of your life, your enamel is going to naturally start getting stronger. And overall, you're going to be using a sugar substitute to make your teeth whiter. Number six, you will use oil pulling for white teeth. Oil pulling will whiten your teeth better than whitening strips. And you can do it from your home naturally. Let me prove it to you. First, you will pick up a bottle of coconut oil, sesame oil, or sunflower oil. In my opinion, coconut oil is the best choice because it contains antibacterial properties, which means it won't only whiten your teeth, but it's also going to get rid of bacteria that smells bad. But on top of everything, it's the best tasting oil as well. Then you will take a tablespoon of that oil and swish it in your mouth, focusing on the teeth. This is the hard part. You have to do it for around 15 minutes. I personally like to do this when I'm on TikTok or something. This is the only time I ever tell you guys to doom scroll because it makes the time go by way faster. Once you're done, don't spit it in the sink. Spit it in the trash can and then rinse your mouth with warm water to remove any residue. If you start doing this every day, that only way you have fresh breath, but you will have the whitest teeth you've ever had and you no longer have to use whitening strips. If you listen to me and you follow these six steps to have healthy teeth, I promise you, you're going to have the best smile you've ever had."

        "transcript": " Most people assume that massive life changes is what leads to massive results. This isn't true because for you to actually change your life, it all comes from tiny, small micro habits and changes that compound every day. So in this video, I'm going to show you 10 micro habits you can implement today. And if you do them for a week, they will change your life. Starting with number one, wake up to these five songs to get energized. Whenever you want to get motivated, you want energy. You need to start listening to music that has temples between 140 and 160 beats per minute. You see, when you hear a fast-paced song, your body will try to imitate that rhythm by increasing your heart rate as your heart rate rises in response to the music. So does your motivation and energy. So I'm going to give you five songs that have this temple that you can build into a Spotify playlist. So every time you wake up, this is what you're going to listen to. One, silence. Two, I like it. Three, you really got me. Four, every time we touch. Five, seven rings. Six, my mother told me. Seven, feel good. Eight, I can't stop. And nine, think of it. I'm just playing on the last one. But if you put these into a Spotify playlist and you listen to them, as soon as you wake up, you're going to start feeling more energy throughout the day and feel motivated to actually accomplish things. And this is exactly what I'm talking about. You don't have to do drastic changes. You just have to do tiny changes that have a drastic impact, like feeling energized all day. I have nine more of these, which are going to completely transform your life in the next seven days. Number two, you should eat depending what you weigh on the scale to avoid becoming overweight and lazy. There is a scale trick you can do where depending on how you weigh, you're going to change how you eat that day. The reason these daily morning waves will work for you is because it's going to create accountability, which will encourage positive behavior changes. Because when you know that you're going to step on that scale every morning throughout the day subconsciously, you're going to be reaching towards healthier snacks. So the more when you get out of bed, first thing you should do is go take care of your business in the bathroom and then you weigh yourself. If you weigh the same number as you did the day before, eat as you normally would today. If you weigh more than yesterday, I want you to fast till lunchtime. But if you're underweight from yesterday, I want you to reward yourself with an extra snack. The amount of food you eat every week will keep your eating habits in check while also maintaining your healthy weight. Number three, eat the right foods to look better. I'm going to show you exactly what you need to eat to level up your skin, your gut health and your muscles. So here's what you're going to eat based on your specific goals right now. If you want to improve your skin, I want you to start eating avocados, walnuts and berries. If you want to enhance your gut health, I need you to eat more yogurt, kimchi and whole grains. And if you want to build more muscle, I need you to focus on eating more eggs, chicken breasts and quinoa. However, if you want to achieve all three, do what I do every morning to get all these categories in one meal. For breakfast, I'll just have a whole wheat bread with avocado and two eggs. That way you're nourishing your body on all three goals. Number four, rewire your brain in a single day. I'm going to give you three things you can do today to rewire your neural pathways. First, get up. As you normally would, I don't care what time you get up. Go brush your teeth, but instead of using your dominant hand, I want you to brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Second, when you go on your phone to check your emails or if you're going to do scroll, I want you to go on your phone using your non-dominant hand. And finally, I want you to make your cup of coffee or your morning tea only using your non-dominant hand. When you're doing this just one morning, by doing everyday's tasks with your non-dominant hand, you are challenging your brain to create new neural pathways, which has been proven to improve neural flexibility and your ability to learn new skills. That is how simple it is for you to change your life around. You thought I was playing with you and we still have six more to go. Number five, I want you to listen to these books for 15 minutes a day. Here are the five books every man should listen to at least once in their life and why. If you want to find purpose, you should listen to the alchemist. If you want to develop an entrepreneurial mindset, you should listen to the four hour work week. If you want to attract more women, you should listen to No More Mr. Nice Guy. If you want to gain wisdom, listen to man's searching for meaning. And if you want to develop a beast mentality and unbreakable mind, you should listen to extreme ownership. But instead of just reading the entire book or listening to the entire book, I want you to look at the chapters and pick the ones that are specific to what you need right now in your life. For example, most people will listen to the entire four hour work week. But when I picked it up, I only listened to chapter eight, outsourcing life, offloading the rest in a taste of geo arbitrage. Chapter 16, the top 13 new rich mistakes and chapter 20, how to get $700,000 of advertising for just $10,000. Number six, use your mirror to complete every goal you have set. I want you to try this for the next seven days. And yes, you're going to feel weird at first. You don't have to tell anybody you're doing it, but I promise you it's going to change your life every night. Before you go to bed, I want you to look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself one question. What is the one thing that I can do today that can make that person proud, that person that's looking right back at you? I want you to write that down on that mirror, on the window of your car or put it as the background on your phone. By doing this, you are setting an intention for yourself to hold yourself accountable to take it even further. You should check out our sponsor for today, BetterHelp and tell another person so you can increase your accountability. I don't want you to just keep it to yourself. If you're talking to a licensed professional like the ones from BetterHelp and you tell them what your goals are, now you have somebody that's not only listening, but can give you advice to help guide you through your life and keep you on track. And what I love about BetterHelp is that if you click the link down below, you can fill out an entire questionnaire and you're going to be matched with the exact therapist who fits your personality and your needs. Once you have somebody like that that can hold you accountable, that's there for you, they might even be able to help you show you what's limiting you or what's holding you back. And the great part is you get to talk to them however you're comfortable, whether that's a video call, a phone call or just through messaging. If you guys want to check out BetterHelp, you can go to BetterHelp.com slash men's fashion or click the link down below. But if you do this, you're going to crush every goal you ever set for yourself and you're going to start seeing massive results. Alright, by this point, you are giving yourself unlimited motivation and energy with the right playlist. Meaning, depending on your weight, you're also consuming the foods that are going to make you look better. You rewired your brain, you're consuming the right books to level up. And now you have the cheat code how to reach any goal you set yourself for. And every single micro habit I just showed you takes seconds to implement. That is what I'm talking about. If you do this for the next seven days, you're going to be a completely new man in a week and there are still four more things I want you to implement. Number seven, use this hand technique to instantly remove anxiety. Let me show you a super quick anti-anxiety technique you can do anywhere. First, extend your hands outside in front of you with your palms down and your fingers together. Then, you're going to angle your hands and bring them together, latching them just like I'm showing you. Now, press your thumb down into the hand on top. Hold for five seconds, then release for a few seconds. And then repeat that process a total of five times. If you do this right now, even if you're not anxious, you're going to start feeling this like calmness, this like release of like, of intensity. It is the best hack that you can do anywhere. And look, if you don't feel any dequeous and anxiety or you still feel down or depressed, it could be a more deeply rooted problem at which point you should have somebody to talk to. I always recommend to have a friend or a family member. And if you don't, better help is the best solution because it is somebody you can confide in that's always going to be there and they're a profession. So they can guide you and help you out through whatever problem it is that you're facing. And remember how I said that they'll pair you with the right person? If for whatever reason you can pair with the person and you don't like it, you can easily swap therapists until you find somebody that truly resonates with you. I'm telling you, better help is a cheat code for guys that want to level up. If you guys want to check them out, it'll be linked down below. Number eight, only work out between seven and 10 a.m. If you want more testosterone, you should work out between the hours of seven and 10 a.m. with these five exercises to build the ideal male physique with the highest testosterone production possible. First, like I said, you should schedule your workouts between seven and 10 a.m. According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine, this is when every guy's testosterone is at its peak, which just means you're going to be able to push yourself further. Studies have also found that men who work out at this time can increase their testosterone levels, which means you're getting more bang for your buck. Next, you're going to want to perform the five exercises that produce the most testosterone and men, which I have ranked from least to most testosterone production. First, it's chest tips. Second, it's pull-ups. Third is bench press. Fourth is deadlift. And fifth is barbell squats. If you work out between seven and 10 a.m. with these five exercises, your testosterone levels are going to explode. Number nine, use this journal technique so you can learn every single day. Imagine that you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed with negative thoughts and emotions swirling in your head. This is what's draining your energy, making you less productive, and having you procrastinate. You can easily fix this with three easy journaling questions. First, I want you to grab your journal, a notebook, or just open the Notes app on your phone. And then I want you to ask yourself one of the three questions that you see on screen. I'm going to leave them on screen so you can easily screenshot. I don't want you to hold back. I want you to write as much as you can and as detailed as you can, and you're going to feel an instant relief as you do. And this is what I'm trying to explain to you guys. When you express what you're feeling instead of holding it in, it helps you actually deal with the problem head on. So whether it is writing it down or talking to a professional through better health, it is an amazing solution for you to get rid of all the negative thoughts that keep you procrastinating. And number 10, I want you to watch more TV. To be successful, you heard me right. You're not going to do it like every other guy, because most men, they consume movies that leave them unmotivated or uninspired. What I want you to do is what I do. I like to watch movies that inspire me or that teach me something about business. Here are the 10 movies I love watching that I think every man should watch at least once in their life. One, the founder. Two, jobs. Three, the social network. Four, the wolf of Wall Street. Five, the pursuit of happiness. Six, the big short. Seven, Wall Street. Money never sleeps. Eight, money ball. Nine, war dogs. And 10, Rocky. I'm telling you. If you watch any of these, you're going to have unlimited motivation. And if you combine them with these next nine micro habits I showed you in a week, you will feel and be a completely different dude. See you boys next time."

        "transcript": " When a girl finds you attractive, she's gonna make eye contact, she's gonna smile, play with her hair, even make an excuse to try to touch you. But these signs are obvious, you know this, and it usually only happens when the girl's extremely confident. So today I want to show you six subtle and un-obvious signs that you're more attractive than you think you are. Number one, girls sweat when you look at them. Everyone will tell you if a girl looks at you, she likes you. But sometimes a girl will look at you and it's a complete accident. However, if she looks at you while removing obstructions, this is an un-obvious sign she likes you. Let me explain. You see in a recent study, you know I had to come with the facts. I don't just make things up, bro. In a recent study, researchers had multiple men and women look at each other. Throughout the study, the men and women viewed each other as normal while wearing sunglasses and also while wearing vision obstructing blindfolds. What they found is that when a woman looked at a man with their own eyes without any obstruction, she experienced the largest physical response. What this means for you is that if you're ever out at a party or at school and you notice a girl physically trying to get a glimpse at you while looking past obstructions, even if it's only once, she's looking for that physical response. That means she's attracted to you. It also means, for example, let's say you make eye contact with a girl with sunglasses and she removes her sunglasses to then look at you again. She's looking for that elevated physical response, meaning you're definitely attracted. It also revealed that when a man looked at a woman eye to eye with no obstruction, her skin produced more sweat as a response. So if you notice that you're talking to a woman and then she complains that it's really hot in here, even if it isn't, or you notice her take her jacket off. It's an unobvious sign she finds you attractive, bro. I didn't lie to you. I'm going to give you all the signs you've never heard of to show you that you're more attracted than you've ever thought. But I'm not stopping there because there's five more signs that I need you to learn. Number two, babies and children, they'll stare at you. I want you to look at these four pictures from a study and I want you to select which one you believe is the most attractive. I'll give you some time. Chances are you pick the exact same picture that a baby would pick. I'm not lying to you, bro. It's not a hook. The reason for this is that babies are able to spot conventional attractiveness. And no, this is not just my opinion. This is a scientific fact. In the study with 29 babies, they were shown four variations of the same woman. The same variations I just showed you. The original image shows the women as symmetrical as possible, which is conventionally attractive. While the others were slightly manipulated and distorted to make look less attractive. Then using visual trackers, they tracked the baby's eyes to see which pictures the babies preferred to look at. And the study revealed that the babies were far more interested in the face that was traditionally attractive and more balanced. It's simple. We as humans are genetically hardwired to prefer things that are symmetrical, even as small as babies. And as we grow older, we find this symmetry to be sexually attractive. So if you're ever out in public, you're grocery shopping and you notice somebody's baby's pointing at you or they can't stop staring at you. It's not because you look funny. It's because it's an unobvious sign. You probably have a symmetrical face and that's attractive. Number three, girls will try to get within four feet of you. Studies show that close proximity is key to establishing attraction. So if a girl finds you attractive, she's going to try to get closer. This is obvious. However, exactly how close she needs to be. So you know she's for sure attractive. Totally depends on the environment, whether you're at school, work or at a party. So here's how to know if a girl finds you attractive in any of these settings. Let's start at school. If you're at school or college campus, girls tend to feel more comfortable being closer to guys. So if they find you attractive, they'll get within one feet or 30 centimeters of you. This happens while you're at the library. She sits next to you in class or while walking to your next class. If you're noticing that they're comfortable being that close to you, it's an unobvious sign that you're attractive. Now, you can also manipulate this. You can artificially, almost like in Thai swim into want to be closer to you if you use the right cologne. Now, for school, you want more of a citrus note that's not too heavy. And I also don't recommend you going for the fragrance that everybody uses like your savage. Instead, try something different. One that smells amazing is history's the perfume from Semper. I'm subscribed to Semper for the last five years and I love it because I get to explore new scents all the time. I got this one last month. Bro, this thing's a cheat code. It smells delicious and it's citrusy. It's well balanced. It's not strong. It's perfect if you're in school. The next setting is if you're at work. Here, a woman's still going to want to get closer if she's attracted to you, but because it's a professional environment, she's not going to get as close as if she was at school. So here, if she finds you attractive, she's going to get within around three feet of you or around 60 to 80 centimeters. And again, you can do the same thing you did at school and encourage her to get closer with the right fragrance, except the fragrance has to be different because, again, you're in a professional setting. For work, you want something slightly stronger that gives more of a mature note. And again, I'm not going to recommend to you a basic cologne. I want something that's low key that nobody uses. Try the Drift Open Road Cologne. Bro, this thing smells amazing. This also came in my in Semper subscription. It's a low key fragrance that I promise you. No one she's ever met has smelled and it's going to entice her to get closer to you. And that's what I love about Semper. Look, if you were to buy these fragrances as an entire bottle, you're going to be spending hundreds, if not multiple hundreds of dollars, just to get a single bottle. With Semper, you get fragrances delivered every month and you're spending under 20 bucks. And the great part is that if you apply it correctly, it lasts you around two to three months, especially as you start building a collection and you're interchanging the fragrances. But now let's talk about a party or casually hanging out with friends. In these settings, sometimes the girl, you might not know her that well or you're just getting to know her. So she's not going to be comfortable with getting super close to you. So if you notice her inching her way closer and closer to you within that four to five feet range or 90 to 110 centimeter range, this girl has interest in you. And as the night progresses, she's going to start closing that gap. But again, don't be dumb, bro. Entice her to close that gap faster with fragrances. I swear fragrances are a cheat code to get women hooked to you. You just got to buy the right one for a party. This is the time you want something strong. I recommend dark, brooding notes. These are the ones where you stand out in a room and when she smells you, she's just going to want to get closer. A great one is this one from commodity. If you want all of the most popular fragrances, some of the biggest brands in the world, without having to spend that type of money, you have to check out Semper. I'm going to have them linked down below with a special code that's going to make your first month an absolute steal so you can start wearing fragrances that literally entices women to get closer to you. If you're smart, I would click that link down below and check out now. Four, no one ever calls you attractive. That's right. You never getting a compliment on your attractiveness is an unobvious sign that you're actually attractive. There are two main compliments a girl will give you, intrinsic compliments and extrinsic compliments. One means that you're attractive. The other means that you're not. I'm going to show you how to tell the difference and what each compliment actually means. First, I want you to look at extrinsic compliments. These are what I call the low risk surface level compliment. They don't require much thought stuff like, I like your shirt. Your haircut looks good. You're such a good friend. You look good today. If you're always getting compliments like this, it likely means you're not that attractive and the girl's just being nice, bro. But next, you have intrinsic compliments. These go beyond your looks and focus on who you are as a person. But these are the ones that actually mean you're attractive, but they're just not as obvious, such as, You're so funny. You always make me laugh. You're different, not like other guys. I feel like you're going to get me into trouble. You're so easy to talk to, I love it. If you always get compliments like this often, this is an unobvious sign that you're actually attractive. Number five, older women show interest in you. If a woman ever does this, she's not just trying to be nice. She's flirting with you. You see, younger women, they always get messages from men, so they don't waste their time messaging men first. Older women, on the other hand, they never get as many messages. So they actually have to put an effort and message guys first if they want to meet up with someone. And they're only going to message the guys that they find attractive. What this means is kind of a stop, but you can easily gauge your attractiveness by running a test on older women. So go to your favorite dating app, Bumble Tender Hinge, I don't care. And then I want you to increase the age range of women you want to meet by 10 years above your current age. If you're under 18, don't listen to me. This is for everybody else. Then over the next seven days, I want you to assess the amount of likes and messages you start getting. If you see an increase, it means that you're attractive and you're likely just spending time around other attractive women that have so many options that they don't have the need to tell you. By this point, most of you guys should feel like studs. I guarantee you have experienced one of these signs, whether it's unobstructed eye contact. Babies appreciating that facial symmetry. Girls trying to get close to you and you're not even realizing it. You never getting those personal physical compliments. And now understand that older women showing interest in you is actually a good thing. If you haven't seen any of these signs, I guarantee you this last unobvious sign. Almost every guy has experienced and it means that you're attractive. Number six, your male friends are sneaky f***er fish. You see, most men will focus on the behavior of girls to determine if they're attractive or not. However, you can figure out if you're attractive much faster by just watching the behavior of other dudes around you. Yo, no ditty, bro. Put that baby oil away. That's not what I'm talking about. The most unobvious sign that you're attractive is when men use a behavior called sneaky f***er fish. And here's how it works. In nature, that dominant male always gets the most attention from females. For humans, this is typically the good looking guy that's mogging everyone. Because of this, non-dominant males or uglier guys will adopt feminine behaviors or even pretend to be women to avoid threatening the alpha male. Once they bypass that alpha male and pretend that they're no longer a threat, they quickly shift their focus to pursuing those same women. This behavior is commonly seen in fish, which is where the term sneaky f***er fish comes from. What this means for you is if you notice men around you displaying feminine traits, especially when you're present, it probably means that you're attractive and they feel threatened by you. And the only way they'll get access to women is by acting like they're their best friends. Now, these behaviors include always agreeing with the girl, even if she's wrong, constantly defending a girl, even if she's made the mistake, or pretending not to be interested in girls or touching girls, even though it's obvious he's obsessed with them. If you ever see one or two of these signs, it's an unobvious sign that you're more attractive than you think."

        "transcript": " Have you ever caught a girl looking your way and then quickly just glancing away? Bro, I know you were probably confused wondering if she liked you. I'm here to tell you. She probably found something about you irresistible. So today, I'm going to show you exactly why that was and show you six more traits that women can't resist on a man. So number one, women can't resist this specific color on men. You see, dark colors make men look more mature or successful, making them irresistible to women. The best part is that these colors are easy to style to begin. You need to consider the five primary dark colors. You have black, dark blue, deep black, dark brown, and dark green. From here, you have three easy options on how to wear them. First, you can pick any of the five colors and just wear it on your entire outfit for a monochromatic look. That all was easy. But next, you can try something called the highlight technique. This involves wearing a shirt and pants in the same color and then adding a contrasting white pair of shoes. And finally, you can switch things up with the Oreo technique. This involves wearing dark colors for your top and shoes and then pairing them with light colored pants in the middle. So now I just want you to pick your favorite dark color and choose one of these three styling techniques. And I promise you, you're going to look irresistible to women. You're going to notice them looking at you. It might even catch the odd one looking away quickly. But the actor can get them to come over and talk to you. You're going to need these next six irresistible techniques. Sixth is number two. I want you to wear this specific scent. You see, these cologne I'm about to give you are the best colognes for every season that women can't resist. You see, in colder seasons like fall and winter, the slower evaporation of your fragrance means that you should prioritize scents that have strong top and middle notes. So for these colder months, you want to choose scents that have amber, vanilla, sandalwood, cacao, caramel, and chestnut. Now in a war war season, like your spring and summer, the heat will cause your fragrance to evaporate faster, which is going to make the scent very strong for anybody around you. For this reason, you should go with lighter and fruitier notes such as your citrus, like lemon, lime, or orange, or something like coconut, floral, or marine notes. Now, when you start wearing the right scent for the right season, with the right colors, bro, the girls around you, I'm making it almost impossible for them to be able to resist you. You're welcome. Theta is number three. I want you to walk like you're the man. A woman can tell right away when you're not confident if you're walking around with bad posture. So I'm going to show you how to instantly fix your posture and become irresistible to the women around you. First, I want you to find a flat wall and stand with your back against it and make sure four points on your body touch that wall, your feet, your hips, followed by your shoulders, and finally your head. Now, I want you to try to maintain this exact position as you walk and you're going to immediately feel and improve it, not just on your confidence, but just how you feel. Now, if you practice this every morning before you leave the house, you're going to start walking with such a confidence that any woman's going to notice. Number four, skin that looks like glass. As a matter of fact, here are the three most popular skin care products. Men buy to get perfect skin and why they're not working for you. You see, most women, they'll focus on products to get clear skin. What they don't realize is that clear skin, it starts within how many times have you bought an expensive face wash? You wash your face twice a day, but you still end up on breakouts. You want to know why? Because your body doesn't have enough biotin. You see, biotin helps metabolize sugar and bad fats in your body, which aids your skin into producing more protein and making it firmer. Daily, you need about 5000 milligrams of biotin. Most of you never think about that when it comes to clear skin. And this is exactly why I decided to start my own supplement line, Get Supplements, and start with our first product, which we're calling Get Attractive. One of the main ingredients that I'm adding is biotin. Exactly 5000 milligrams I'm a science guy. I love studies. And I wanted to make sure that the formulation was perfect. Now the second step to achieve glass skin is sunscreen. Right? Every guy knows that they should have sunscreen. And while that is amazing and you should be doing it, you have to understand that your skin can also create its own protective barrier and protect itself against the sun's harmful rays if you give your body enough vitamin E. Vitamin E works by creating a protective layer around your skin that shields against the sun's UVB rays and any other external factors. But again, most of you understand that this pelvic skin that you're looking for starts with what you consume, the food that you're eating. Now to give your body enough vitamin E to produce its own protective layer, you need to be consuming 14 milligrams of vitamin E. You guessed it. I did all the research on this. This is why I know all this stuff. I added in that exact amount in our new Get Attractive supplement. And what I want is to create a supplement for men that makes you attractive from within, that you can take every day and it's just a single capsule and you don't have to think about it. You let me do the thinking. You let me do the research and I formulate a product that doesn't exist because no one is doing supplements for guys so they can look and feel great. And that's what we're going to do with Get Supplements. And finally, when it comes to clear skin, you'll also buy a good moisture every guy does it. But what you don't realize is that if you have enough vitamin D in your body, your skin in your body will be healthy enough to hold on moisture to keep it plump and hydrate. You see, your body is an amazing machine. But if you don't give it the nutrients it needs, you will always be battling with bad skin no matter what your routine looks like. And the sad part is that most of you are deficient of vitamin D and you're not going out enough, which is why you should be aiming for 10 milligrams of vitamin D a day to get that natural boost in hydration and health in your skin. And you guessed it. I added that exact amount to Get Attractive, bro. This is going to be the best supplement to become more attractive and feel better at the work. As a matter of fact, there is no other supplement. We're the only guys because I noticed no one else was doing it. Now, the key here is consistency, which is why when you guys purchase Get Attractive, you can subscribe and receive it every month. That way, you never have to think about it. And every day you can take the supplement and start noticing over the weeks, over the months, just how great your skin is going to start looking. And now whatever skin routine you use, it's always going to work because your skin is actually healthy from within. But from here on out, every other month, we're going to be releasing a new Get Supplements product that's aimed for men to feel and look better. But because you're one of our first buyers, I'm going to call you guys are Attraction Half-Hairs Club. You were one of the first guys to try our supplements. Every time we drop a new supplement, you're going to be able to test it out for free. As part of your multi-subscription, you don't have to pay extra for it. And that's just a gift from me to you for the rest of your life. As long as you're subscribed, again, this offer will never exist again. And it's just for those of you that are believing in Get Supplements and are becoming the first time buyers. Number five, you want to use the right smile for your face shape. You see, there's different types of smiles for different types of faces. And if you master the right smile for your specific face shape, women will not be able to resist you. So if you have more of a rounder face, I want you to keep the top and middle portions of your face still. And I want you to smile mainly with just the lower part of your face. This technique will elongate your face and give you a slimmer appearance. Now, if you have a thin and long face, you want to smile upwards with both the lower and middle parts of your face. This is going to shorten the appearance of your face to balance out your appearance. And finally, if you have a larger mouth, along with one of the previous face shapes I just talked about, I want you to smile still with the lower and middle portions of your face. But I want you to push outwards and not up. With these techniques, not only are you going to look more attractive in every picture, but in person when you do, women will not be able to stop looking at you. Now, by this point, you're starting to understand when you start wearing dark colors, you wear the right scent for you, you walk with confidence, have amazing skin, and a great smile. Of course, women can't resist you. You're starting to understand why they're always looking at you. But there's still two more things you need to truly understand to become fully irresistible to women. Number six, I want you to top down to her. You see a deeper voice will make people treat you better and with more respect. It also makes you incredibly irresistible to the women you talk to. So here is a technique to deepen your voice forever. You see, when the average man talks, he will often finish his sentence in an upwards way. For example, hey, can you pass me a pen? Or, hey, how are you doing? They do this to avoid coming across as rude or to create conflict, but it also makes you sound weak and non-dominant. So an easy way to deepen your voice is to simply end on a download. For example, hey, can you pass me that pen? Or, hey, how are you doing? Versus, how are you doing? Do you notice the difference? When you start down talking towards the end of every sentence, automatically you will deepen your voice and become more irresistible. Number seven, look at her with these types of eyes. The first guy has hunter eyes. While the second has prey eyes, women find men with hunter eyes irresistible compared to the men that have prey eyes because it just signals dominance. So here's how you as a guy can start developing hunter eyes. Start by imagining almost like you have like a light weight attached by a piece of string to your chin. This is going to help you slightly start looking down, giving both your head and eyes more of a dominant appearance. Next, you're going to want to thicken your eyebrows. And the easiest way to do this is to use a dermaroller every morning and apply tea tree oil after each session. And finally, you're going to want to darken your eyebrows, which you can easily do with a coffee scrub where you grab coffee and oil, mix it together and apply it to your eyebrows for 10 minutes once you wash off. You're going to have thick dark eyebrows. And when your chin is tilted downwards, your eyebrows will weigh heavy on your eyes, giving you a more dominant stare. Start doing this and the six other irresistible techniques I showed you in this video. I promise you girls won't stop looking at you, bro."

        "transcript": " Today, I'll react to some of the most viral appearance boosting hats on TikTok to see if they actually work. Look, some of these have been doing some pretty weird stuff, but the last one, bro, your boy would be out of a career with this last hat. So number one, use the right fade. So many guys don't understand that there's different types of fades. You can't just pull up to the barber to say, you know, can I have a fade? But to make it simple for you, there's really only three types of fade that they did with a little bit extra, and you only need one of them depending your face shape. The first fade, it's a low fade, and this is the best type of fade for those of you that have sharp facial features, like a chisel jawline or even high cheekbones. Because your face is already sharp, a low fade will add a little bit more softness to your face so there's more balance. The second is a mid fade. This is for those of you without any sharp features or round features. This will add a bit of definition to your face while a top part prevents it from looking too harsh. Low fade, mid fade, high fade. And third, you have a high fade. This is the best one for guys that have round features or no jawline definition as this is going to give your face a more aggressive appearance to make you look more masculine. Now if you don't know what type of face you have, I'm going to make it simple. If you can look at your cheekbones and your jawline clearly, you have sharp features. If you can't, you have soft features. And if you can kind of see them, you have a balanced face. All you gotta do is choose the fade that matches your face structure. Bro at this point you can walk away just with that one and have a completely changed appearance. But there's still a bunch more tips we have to test out today, including the last one which then I'm telling you this is a little ended like career bro. Number two, no goishak, no problem. Okay, you see those little lines that girl has on her face? Just go on TikTok or Instagram Reels and look for face yoga filter, like you're seeing me do right here. And then you're going to get those exact lines so you know exactly how to move the spoon. So I got the spoon here and some oil. We're going to put some oil at the back of the spoon, kind of like you're seeing. I'm going to mix it around and make sure your face is washed. And then we're going to move in the same direction as you would a goishak tool. Oh, that feels good. And if your spoon is cold, I honestly think this is probably better than a goishak tool because the coldness of the spoon can also help with decreasing inflammation, making your face look more defined. So you can see she's just using light pressure as it go underneath. Then she changes to the back end to do the eyes where you have to be careful. Now, the whole purpose of this is to stimulate the lymphatic system and help drain some of that excess fluid. So if you do it on a daily basis, that's when you're going to get the defined cheekbones and just look more attractive. This is a 10 out of 10. Number three, lip massage. Oris muscle over time, it gets tense and causes your lips to become thinner. See, a lot of guys don't understand this, but nice lips is extremely attractive and something women want. But you probably don't think care of it. What are we going to do? First massage and knee through your entire mouth area. Especially get into the sides of your lips. Okay, that first one's kind of a stretch. These lip massage type of techniques really don't do much other than waste your time. Third, this is a great exercise to plump your lips, lock your lips with your fingers and kiss against the resistance. And number four, your boy ain't doing no kissing masandas, bro. Blood circulation and plump your lips naturally. And lastly, cover your teeth with your lips and press them against each other. All right, let's go test this out. I'm playing, bro. You ain't about to see me kissing facing on this video. Look, most of these are a giant waste of time. There are ways that you can make your lips healthier and look fuller, such as exfoliating them or using a good lip balm. Massages, it's all fake science. Number four, use a derma roller to prevent hair loss. A derma roller uses needles and is one of the best treatments against hair loss. 100%. This guy is feeding literal facts in a study published in the National Library of Medicine. They found that 75% of men that use some kind of derma roller on their head saw substantial increase in hair growth in areas that they were losing it. Here's what most people do wrong. First you need to choose the correct needle size. The best needle size. Yes. Yes. Never use needles. Okay, everyone tells you to use a derma roller, use a derma roller. Nobody tells you that there's different needle sizes and if you don't get the right one for hair growth, it's not going to work. You need to buy a derma roller that's made for hair growth because you can use derma rollers for other things. This one is for a company called Growplex that specializes in hair growth for men and this one has 540 titanium medical grade needles that are 0.75 millimeters long. That is the exact length you need for optimal hair growth. Any longer than this and you're just going to be damaging your skin and it's going to be painful which is not what you're looking for. This is why I like Growplex. So if you guys want a good derma roller for hair growth, thicker hair or help with a receding hairline, I'm going to have Growplex leave down below. 50. Second, to use the derma roller. Wet your hair to expose the thinning area. Yes. Parting where you want your hair to grow back. Roll the derma roller. Yes. So most of the times you will notice where you're losing hair. The best time to see where your hair is thinning is right when you get out of the shower. That's why he recommends wetting your hair. 100% sure. Derma roller 5 to 7 times horizontally. Lift the roller and do the same 5 to 7 times vertically. So he's absolutely correct. You want to hit the derma roller both vertically and horizontally. However, I recommend 5 to 10 times and it really depends on how much hair loss. If you have a lot of hair loss, I would do up to 10. So if you want thicker hair, 100% I recommend this. Add a derma roller to your grooming routine. As a matter of fact, this from Growplex. 95% of their customers that use the derma roller correctly have seen significant hair growth. So if you want hair growth, click the link down below. Number 5. Today I'm going to show you how to find the perfect glasses depending on your face shape. Let's do this. See, glasses are an amazing accessory. It can make anyone look more attractive, but only if you do it right. Most of the times they look weird. The one you're going to want to use is the TikTok filter to figure out the shape of your face. For example, for me it's the oval one. Alright, let's see if this works. So I went out to TikTok. I opened the app and we're going to see which is my face. So we have circular, there's too much space there. Oval. My jaw kind of sticks out there. Still square. Square kind of seems fit. So triangle. No, I think it's square. So your boy has a square face. Alright, my boy did us a favor and put the chart on screen so let's see. Your boy has a square face. And okay, those are the glasses that work on me. Let's go see if this actually looks good. Number 6. No way, I'm excited to see what happens because I did the same thing except I didn't do it like you think I did. The first thing I was worried about was the side effects. Luckily the only side effect I have experienced since starting with monoxidil is dryness in the areas where I apply it. He's absolutely right here. I was applying monoxidil in my beard to make it look thicker and it worked. The problem was dryness. So today I made the switch to use a vitamin hair growth formula that's natural from Groplex and doesn't have any of the side effects that he's discussing. The reason I did this is because this formula contains biotin which helps offset the dryness that monoxidil provides helping my hair maintain its moisture. I've been using monoxidil on and off for 8 years. Anytime I want to thicken my hair you can see them before and afters. It is incredible and it's the one supplement I always recommend everyone to use. So whether you want thicker beard or fix your receding hairline, Groplex is amazing because they go that extra step with their formulation. It is a quick fix with any sort of moisturizing product. Personally I have used different hair oils and of course shampoo. The most important thing, the results. When I started my hair was rapidly thinning and was starting. After just 3 months of daily monoxidil usage my hair looked nice. That is the type of results that I got so I know this dude ain't lying. Just imagine the confidence this man must have received. This guy went from a 3 to an 8 just by thickening his hair using something as simple as monoxidil. I didn't even know he did that on his beard. Bro I'm telling you, monoxidil is the secret formula. It is a literal superpower for us dudes and if you mix it with a derma roller I just showed you you're gonna 10x your results. And if you need either of these go check out Groplex. What I like about them is that you can click the link down below and take a quick quiz and they're gonna tell you the exact products you need for your goals. Again if your hair is falling out or you want a thicker beard I'm gonna leave a link down below for Groplex so you can start maximizing your hair growth with a special discount. It's gonna make it an absolute steal. Number 7 Keep Your Clothing White Man I own a ton of white shirts and white socks and I can never keep them white so I'm excited to test what this guy has to say. Okay here we have my famous essential shirts which are coming back bro but I always work out with these and you can see my collar is yellow let's see if this works. Here I got my antibacterial spray. Here we go. Alright okay now I'm just putting in the washer see if this works. I can't even over the truth. You better not be lying bro. See not bad bro check that out. Pretty white to me. Separate colors. If your mama didn't teach you how to separate your clothing colors you're doing it all wrong. Just wash them in separate bundles that for sure will save your color. Okay I definitely recommend a tide pen it's always a good go to with anything. Definitely a great tip if you want your clothes to stay white. Now you're using the right fade for your face shape. You're using a spoon to drain the fluid in your face so you look more defined. You learned how to use a d'herv\u00e9 roller. You learned how to pick the right glasses for your face shape. You now understand how to have better hair and now you're gonna keep your clothes looking white forever. Number eight. Three style hacks for skinny guys. Okay I'm not a super skinny guy but I used to be so I know if these will work or not. Every skinny guy needs to know. First thing use white undershirts as an underneath layer. This will not only make you look more stylish but the white will also make your torso appear thicker. Agreed it will draw attention to your body. This is a good one. Shirts with long sleeves and then roll up the sleeves to create some excess bulk on your forearms. 100% this is one of my favorite ones. You can do it with sweaters too. It's free. It's fast to use and it applies with any shirt that has long sleeves. It's to avoid anything with diagonal lines around the neck because it slims your face and your neck. So yes, personally I don't like v-neck shirts period that kind of outdated but crew nicks just help cover up your long neck if you're skinny which overall makes you thicker. Number nine. A homemade lip scrub. Wow. Great. I love this. We have a two ingredient lip scrub and this is good because every guy wants better healthier lips but you don't want to have to be buying lip balm. You can do this at home bro. Let's see how it works. Alright so we got some olive oil. Put it in the cup. Then we do some sugar. We mix. Oh I like that. Try it out. The sugar will help remove any dead skin while the olive oil will help hydrate your skin and give them a nice shine. This is great bro. I don't know. I'm trying to look at like you find it here. My lips look good bro. They feel hydrated. The olive oil hydrates while the sugar exfoliates. It's amazing. Number ten. The fade comb. Yo that's way too easy bro. I don't know. I can start saving you 40 bucks every time you go to the barber shop. Now originally the plan was to do it on my hair but I don't want to chop myself up because who's going to shoot the video so we're going to try it on my brother. Let's go. Alright so my bro went and cut his hair. He knew this was coming but this is the fade comb. You ready? Look at the cauliflower here bro. That's what happens when you mess with me. Bro this guy's not a black belt. I promise you that. Alright here we go. So you're just supposed to light it up. Turn on the trimmer. The whoppers to fade him. Ah damn. I mean it's clipping some of your hair. I swear if you are mad. I didn't even jack. Crap. I put you in a rear naked choke. Alright. This is an Amogold metal widow. Ritter bro. This."

        "transcript": " Today, we're gonna go through a day in my life and show you some of the products that I can't live without with the goal being to save as much money as possible. Let's get started. Starting with number one, you're gonna start your morning by cycling your caffeine to save more money and make it more effective. Look, unlike most men, you don't have to use caffeine every morning to start the day. What I recommend, only use it once or twice a week so you can reap the benefits and save money. You have to understand caffeine, it's a drug, which means the more that you use it, the less effective it becomes. So if I'm having caffeine, whether it's coffee tea or an energy drink, I like to have it on a Monday. Then you can skip caffeine Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. And then on Friday, I'll have it again. I do this for two reasons. First, it allows me to start and end my week strong. And second, these two days are the ones that are scientifically proven where people feel the most exhausted. Then on the days that I don't have caffeine, I like to take a glass of water with lemon slices as studies have found that a shot of vitamin C boosts your natural energy levels. This way, you're no longer spending money on coffee or energy drinks. If you want the same results, just take your caffeine on Monday and Fridays. Look, just like that, I'm saving you more money every week and helping you become more productive. This is why I can't live without this stuff. And I still have six more habits that I just can't live without. You're gonna make your life better and saving money. Let's keep going. Number two, replace all expensive skincare with just one product that has three key ingredients. A lot of people spend an insane amount of money trying to treat blackheads, dark eye circles and acne. But these can easily be treated with the right ingredients that target all three layers of your skin. To target the first layer of your skin, you want a product that contains silica acid. This is gonna exfoliate the top layer of your skin and reveal a softer, more hydrated layer underneath. To target the second layer of your skin, you wanna make sure that same product contains seraline, which helps your skin keep in moisture while also building a protected outer layer. And finally, to target the third and deepest layer of your skin, you want that product to also contain retinol, which speeds up cellular turnover and helps eliminate your dry skin. If you use a product that has these three ingredients, you're gonna get rid of 99% of your skin issues. Number three, wear expensive clothing because it's way cheaper to wear. So as I'm getting ready in the morning, this is a $1,000 custom jacket, but I don't like to look at the price. I like to look at the price per wear because what I realized, actually pretty wild, when it comes to buying clothing, I want you to look at these two scenarios. Let's say when you're buying a jacket, you buy a $100 jacket that you somewhat liked. I think this was from Macy's. And you only end up wearing it five times because you didn't like it that much, which means your cost per wear is around $20. In the second scenario, you buy a jacket that you absolutely love. It fits amazing, but it costs you $1,000, but because you love it, you wear it twice a week. So you ended up wearing it a hundred times in one year. This brings your cost per wear to just $10. The point here is that when you're choosing clothing, I want you to prioritize clothing that you truly love over clothing that you might just save a little bit upfront. Because in the long run, you'll actually save money by investing in a few high quality pieces that you adore over a bunch of low quality pieces you barely wanna wear. And by the way, I use this same chain of thought for everything that I buy. For instance, if it's accessories, I could buy a cheap backpack or I could buy a nicer backpack. This was from Nomadly. It's a little bit more on the premium side when it comes to price point, but I love wearing it to the point that I even bought the matching travel bag. They call this the bento bag. So when I'm traveling, I feel good. Like I actually want to wear this stuff because it elevates my outfits and because I actually like it, my cost per wear on this backpack, I use this every single day. It's probably under $5. And as a matter of fact, for you it's gonna be cheaper than for me because if you guys click the link down below and check out Nomadly, you can see all their cool accessories and you can even get an extra 10% off if you use my code teachingments fashion 10. Four, always have your everyday carry. Everything I carry in my backpack is for a specific purpose. So let me show you what's inside my bag and why I carry it. First, let's start with the front pocket. We have wired headphones because I am sick and tired of losing my AirPods. I was wearing them in a store the other day and I've got a bunch of comments. You know, why are you using these? I'm tired of losing my AirPods. I've gone through like 10 AirPods. We're not doing that anymore. Next, always carry a sunscreen stick. This is game changing because you can re-up your sunscreen midday. My skin has been flawless ever since I started carrying this. Of course, you got the car keys. Always carry a fragrance with you. This is a must. Every guy needs a small deodorant in their backpack. Self-explanatory. Let's move on to the bigger bag. The stuff in here, I don't think anybody carries because they don't think about it. Rice Krispies. These rice cakes, every time I'm hungry, because I'm always hungry, I'm always munching. This is great, low calorie snack. It's amazing. The boy has a sweet tooth. I always have candy either in my office or in my backpack. I've been this with my entire life. I'm not changed now. I always carry a hydration pack. This is the first thing I pack up in my bag because in the middle of the day, I like to add it to any water cup or water bottle I'm having to fuel up on my electrolytes. I'm always getting cramps because I'm working out too much, I guess. Back of gum. Self-explanatory. Every guy needs a clean, crispy white tea. Whether it's, you know, I'm gonna go do a pickup game. I'm gonna go to the gym real quick, or if I just get stained and I wanna re-up a fresh white tea, always carry that with me. Now we're moving on to the main bag. Now this is what I love about my No Man Bag. I showed you this before. This is my go-to. Look how small this thing is, but I carry a ton of stuff because of all the compartments. This is what these guys do well. Not only is it a compact bag with great leather finishes, it has a waterproof texture, but all the compartments make it easy for me to carry everything. And I know where everything is. Moving on to the big bag. The big compartment has padding. And this is obviously where I put it. I have my MacBook and my tablet, my iPad, which again, it's a mandatory, but the padding helps protect my stuff. Bro, I'm telling you, if you wanna level up your accessories and buy something that you're cost per use, it's gonna be under $5 because you're gonna be wearing it so much. No Man Bag. Go to No Man Lane, check out their bags. I'm gonna have them linked down below. Use my special discount code, which is gonna make it even more affordable. It's gonna change your life and change how you carry everything. And then last but not least, a pen. I always, I love pens, but this one was given to me by a friend and business partner. It's a limited series Cartier pen. Bro, I love cycling my pens, but this was just sexy. Anytime I have to sign a check, sign a contract, you know your boy's pulling out the big boy. So this is what I carry every day. You as a man need your own everyday carry and everything you carry should have a reason. Number five, use food delivery apps to get cheap food. Look, I'm better go downstairs and get the food that I just ordered. But it reminded me, one of these, I can't live without this habit. See, food delivery apps are doing crazy deals all the time. You just need to know where to find them. So what you first wanna do, avoid the big players. Uber, Eats, Door Dash, these guys just care about profit, which means they're charging crazy amounts of money. You don't order there. Instead, order from lesser known players, horsemates. Order up. These apps typically offer crazy discounts. And in some cases, even free meals, just to get you to come in. In a lot of cases, when you download all of them, you'll see 10, 20, even 30% off. But I'm not stopping there. There's more to do. Next, I want you to find their new up and coming restaurants. A lot of times, they're offering buy one, get one free deals because they want new customers or restaurants that are lower priced. That way, you can get amazing deals on top of the discounts that these up and coming delivery apps are giving you. I am putting you on right now, bro. When you stack these two tricks, I just showed you right now, which is what I do all the time. You're getting food delivered to your door at 50% off. Sometimes you get a two for one and get 30% off for two different meals, bro. You're welcome. Number six, replace trying to learn online. Look, after work, I always like to come to my office and try to learn something new. What I found is that learning from YouTube videos, courses or classrooms, it's all wrong. You watch it, you don't retain any information and you don't put it into practice. Making them a complete waste of time and money. So here's what I do to make sure I get the most value as possible from any course or YouTube video that I watch. See, if you're only listening to something, you're only gonna retain about 5% of the information. If you read or watch, that goes up to 10%. But if you read, watch and listen, that goes up to 20%. So you wanna always focus to learn from videos rather than just regular books or audio books. But most people, this is the point they stop at. Next, I wanna make sure that I demonstrate whatever I just learned to someone I know, this is gonna boost it up to 30%. I'll also discuss what I learned with that person, which boosts my retention up to 50%. Now, most people won't even get this far, but I like to keep taking it further because there's two more things you can do to really increase retention. First, I go out and I actually apply what I just learned. This will boost it up to 75%. Once I successfully applied it into my life, I'll then teach this to somebody else, which will boost retention to a full 100%. Now, if I buy a course, I'm getting 100% of my value rather than the 5% to 10% that everyone else gets. And number seven, kill yourself destructive habits. If you were to live your life without ever doing any of these five habits, you would feel better, look better and save a ton of money. The problem is that once you finish your work day or your school day and they end up ruining the five habits in order from least damage to most damage is cigarettes, porn, vaping, weed and alcohol. And the thing is that if you just do one of these, you're gonna still be able to navigate through life. But the thing is, most people use these in a chain, meaning that once you do one, you'll follow on and do the next one. And if you can't stop, you will be at a massive disadvantage compared to the guy that does none of these. Because once you get to two or three, you'll never grow. And if you're doing four to five of these bad habits, you're gonna stay at the rock bottom for the rest of your life. So listen to me, I want you to do this exact daily routine yourself and just see how much better your life is and how much money you end up saving. See you tomorrow."

        "transcript": " Clothing can transform an unattractive man into an attractive man, but it all depends on what you wear and how you wear it. So in today's video, I'm going to be showing you the eight fashion mistakes that are making you look bad as a man. So you can transform into that attractive guy overnight. Let's start with the first fashion mistake. You're using clothing that's dropping your aura points. Look, your aura is just basically how cool you look. But most guys' outfits are full of mistakes that are costing them aura points. So to keep it very simple, here's a quick list of clothing idols that are draining your aura, your dirty shoes, your fly is open, your shirt or clothes has holes in it. You're wearing skinny jeans, your jeans shorts are above your knee, you're mixing Nike and Adidas clothing, your socks are yellow and stained. And finally, you're wearing baggy clothes, but really it's just too big for you. Look, just like that, I'm already preventing you from dressing bad and I'm getting you to look better. But there are still seven more mistakes you need to avoid if you want to look your absolute best, which takes me to number two. You don't know how to wear baggy pants. Most men, they look terrible in baggy pants, but it's not the pants, it's you. First off, you need to understand, you're not wearing actual baggy pants. See, if you're a guy that's used to wearing skinny jeans, you're going from skinny jeans to just straight-cut pants. Those are baggy, what you should be looking for are pants that are around three to five centimeters larger than your legs. This is when you start getting into the baggy territory. Next, you're pairing the wrong shirt. Most assume, all right, I have baggy pants, I should pair it with a baggy shirt as well. This is incorrect. What you actually need is some sort of slim top to add balance to your outfit. For example, I love to wear tank tops with my baggy pants. But lastly, you're messing it up with your shoes. When you're wearing baggy pants, I always suggest you try multiple shoes, but a general rule of thumb is wear shoes that are a bit thicker or chunkier. These are kind of in the middle. These are Thursday boots, new court sneakers. You guys already know that when it comes to my plain white sneakers, Thursday is my go-to. But they just released these new sneakers that are designed a little bit heavier, so they look hefty and they pair perfectly with baggy pants. And I love that they're white because I can use them all the time. As more on to the third mistake, you are wearing all black. Every style guy will tell you all wear all black because it makes you look good, but it's actually making you look worse. It's not that wearing all black is a bad look. The problem is that you're wearing all black incorrectly. There are three rules you should follow when you wear black. First off, the mistake most guys make is that they'll throw on a black t-shirt, some black fitting jeans, and call it a day. You need to level this up. Swap those skinny black jeans for black trousers. The second rule is that you should add some texture. So we're going to take it up a notch. Swap that black t-shirt for a sweater. This is going to add layers and depth to an outfit, which is necessary because you're wearing the same color. But the third rule is that you must wear jewelry. See, black is already very devoid of any vibrancy and very boring. Jewelry is a great way to bring life into this outfit. So to avoid you looking like a club bouncer, you want to start wearing jewelry and to know what type of jewelry to wear. Just look at your veins. If your veins look kind of purple or bluish, wear silver jewelry. If they're more greenish, kind of like mine, you can go ahead and wear gold jewelry. So just add some necklaces, bracelets or rings. You're good to go. Number four, aren't matching your socks to your outfit. Most men will ruin their outfits all because of their socks. So I'm going to show you how to match your socks to your outfit. First off, always match the color of your socks with your shoes. This applies to summer, winter or formal events. Next, you need to match the sock length to your sneakers and you're going to base it based on the shoe that you're wearing. So if you're wearing high top sneakers, you should always wear longer tube socks that are higher than your sneakers and nothing under that. If you're wearing low cut sneakers, you can go for low cut socks and anything above that, even though I still prefer higher tube socks with this look. Now, that said, the styling color of your socks will only take you so far because if you're pairing those socks with crappy shoes, it's not going to matter. You're still going to be messing up your style. So you need to understand that whatever outfit you have, it always starts with the foundation, the shoes. And if you want great shoes, I recommend Thursday. See, Thursday has you covered from boots right now that fall and winter is coming to sneakers. You go to my closet, 80% of our shoes are from Thursday. What I love about them is that everything's handmade with quality leathers giving you the assurance that once you buy these shoes, you won't have to replace them in years. I had boots from Thursday in my closet that are about four years old. That's how long this stuff lasts you. And the best part is you're not going to break the bag. If you guys want to check out Thursday and level up your style with better shoes, you can click the link down below and check out the shoes that you saw me wearing in today's video. Number five, you're not taking care of your clothing. I want you to take a look at these two outfits. The one on the left, it looks great. While the one on the right looks terrible. But here's the thing, I'm wearing the exact same pieces in both outfits. The only difference is how I take care of my clothes before I put it on. So here's how you're going to start taking care of your clothes to always look good. First, you need to learn how to store your clothes. You want to hang up t-shirts to avoid wrinkles and fold lines. For thicker items like jerseys or sweaters, these you want to fold them because you don't want to get any shoulder bumps on the hems when you hang it. Second, you need to get smart about laundry. Look, your mom is not going to be doing your laundry for the rest of your life. So you need to stop mixing your clothes colors and stop washing in high heat. You want to do three piles, your blacks, your whites and your colored. And only wash your clothing at 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 degrees Celsius to protect the fabric of your clothes. And finally, ditch the iron and invest in a steamer. Look, it's going to make your life 10 times easier, but also going to keep your clothes fresh because you're going to neutralize any bad odors every time you're steamed your clothes. You follow these three steps, you're going to look better in every outfit because you're learning how to take care of them. So far, I've already saved you from negative aura points, from wearing baggy pants the wrong way, from wearing all black outfits that make you look like a bartender. I'd even showed you how to fix your socking and now how to take care of your clothes. These are the mistakes that 99% of guys are making and now you'll never make again. But there are three more mistakes I want to make sure you never do so you always look good in your clothes. Number six, you're making the same shoe mistakes over and over again. I knew a buddy in school, his name was Thomas. He had good style, I'm not even gonna lie, it was pretty decent. But his shoe game was the worst I had ever seen in my life. No matter what this dude put on, the shoes would just always ruin it. So in honor of my boy, your three shoe mistakes he would always make, I want you to avoid so you can always look good. First, never mix and match Nike and Adidas. I always prefer to buy socks with no branding, they're cheaper and you can mix it with any brand you want. Second mistake, stop overdressing when you have state and sneakers. When your sneakers are loud, the rest of your outfit needs to be culled. Let your sneakers stand out. And third, stop buying a bunch of low quality shoes instead of investing in a few high quality pairs. Not only will they make your outfits so cheap, but low quality shoes wear out faster, which makes your outfits look worse because now your shoes look busted. If you instead listen to me and buy a few high quality pairs like the sneakers I showed you, those are affordable. They look great and they're versatile. You're gonna make every outfit look more expensive while saving money because you don't have to be replacing them. I'm telling you right now, the best decision you could ever make is level up your shoe game with high quality shoes because now every outfit you put on will look good. So whether you want boots or sneakers, you can click the link down below and go check out Thursdays. Look at their collection. I promise you, you're going to fall in love with these styles. Mistakes are the mistake seven. You are trying to buy style, but you can't because a lot of men think, oh, being broke is the reason I can't have style, but you have an advantage. I'm going to show you why being broke actually gives you more style. You see, when you're broke, you're less likely to spend money with clothing with ugly brand names and logos all over it, which at the end will make you look less stylish. Instead, you can focus on basic, timeless pieces with no logo that just looks good on your body. You also become more unique. While everyone else is chasing all the standard brands and trends, you're probably exploring thrift shops or discovering one-of-a-kind items that no one else is looking. And third, you probably take better care of your clothing. Look, I'm telling you firsthand, bro, when I was growing up, my parents barely combined me one pair of shoes. So for the whole school year, I needed to make sure those sneakers were squeaky clean. So when you develop these practices of actually taking care of your clothes, you're going to look better than the other guy that's not taking care of his clothes. That's why I'm telling you, bro, if you make the investment on like high quality, let's say, white sneakers from Thursday and you really take care of them, you could have those for the next one to two years and never have to buy another sneaker because they're versatile and you actually took care of it. It takes you to number eight. You don't know how to get back your aura. Look, at the start of this video, I showed you eight ways that you were losing aura points. Now, I'm going to show you eight ways to increase your aura with your style. I want you to wear a crisp white t-shirt under your sweaters to add more layers. I want you to opt for boots that have a heel like this one from Thursday so you can be taller. I want you to mix in vintage items from garage sales and thrift stores. I want you to always wear at least one accessory like sunglasses. I want you to always steam your clothes right before you leave so you can always look crisp. I want you to choose crew neck t-shirts as they will make your shoulders look broader and your arms look bigger. I want you to match white shoes with black pants and a black top for an easy, stylish fit. And finally, use minimal chains to make a statement without being over the top. If you follow everything I've laid out on this video with the clothing you already have, you'll go from unattractive to attractive by tomorrow. See you boys next time."

        "transcript": " The weird guys won't do anything to look more attractive, but what you don't realize is that all you need are two things. A toggle vaseline and this video guide showing you how to use that. So today, I'm going to show you seven vaseline tricks that would transform your appearance and completely change your life. Get started. Number one, create your own fragrance at home. That's going to last longer. Look, every guy wants to smell better for longer. However, most colognes lose their effectiveness after a couple of hours before you realize it. You can't even smell it on you anymore. So if you create your own Vaseline infused fragrance, it would last forever. And here's who you're going to do it. Start by boiling at least one liter of water in a pot. Once the water is boiling, you want to place that whole tub of Vaseline inside of there until the Vaseline becomes liquid. Once it's melted, I want you to remove that Vaseline from the water and let it dry. You're going to open the lid, grab your favorite fragrance and spray as much as you want inside. The more you spray, the more intense it will be. Me personally, I like to keep adding until my hands tired. So I want my fragrance to be intense. Then you're going to let it dry for a few minutes. The Vaseline will go back into being a solid. And the next time you want to apply a fragrance, just grab this and apply it to your pulse point, which will be each side of your neck, on your wrist, and even your jawline. These areas emit heat, which helps expand your fragrance. When you combine that with Vaseline, which helps keep the fragrance tighter on your skin so it doesn't evaporate, you're going to be smelling good all day long. And just like that, I have now changed your life and how you use fragrances forever with something as simple and as affordable as a tub of Vaseline. And I'm not done because if you really want to look attractive, I have six more tricks that you've never seen in your life. This moves us on to number two, you and Vaseline, the thickening in your eyebrows. I want you to look at these two guys and tell me what the biggest difference is. Some of you might say the hair may mean something in the jawline, but now all that is wrong. The biggest difference between the better looking guy and the bad looking guy is their eyebrows. They instantly make him attractive. And that's because well groomed thick eyebrows add structure and masculinity to the face while thin and messy eyebrows will make you look asymmetrical and more feminine. If your eyebrows look anything like the guy on the right, you're going to use Vaseline to fix it. You're going to start by grabbing a little bit of Vaseline in between your fingers and rub it together until you emulsify it. Then you're going to apply them to your eyebrows, pushing them upwards and outwards. You want to follow the direction of the hair. What this is going to do is it's going to stretch each eyebrow hair to its full length. It's also going to make the eyebrow hair and look thicker. And ultimately the Vaseline will hold that in its place, giving you the illusion of thick, well groomed eyebrows. Number three, use Vaseline to get bigger and softer lips. This is the fastest way that you can improve your lips to make them look healthier and fuller with four easy products. Honey, you're going to use Vaseline coconut oil and a toothbrush. Once you have those four, you can get these full around your house. Once you have them, pay attention because you're going to do this routine. First, after you've done brushing your teeth, I want you to wash your toothbrush and then dip it in coconut oil. Use this to brush your lips. This is going to remove any remaining dead skin and then bring blood to the surface of your lips. While the coconut oil helps hydrate your skin to help prepare any damage you might have done as you're scrubbing your lips because your lips aren't very sensitive. Now, every guy should do this because a study found that people that have fuller lips are seen as more attractive, both men and women. Now, this is a free way to do it. If you really want to take your lips to the highest level possible, I suggest you use the Kiss Distant from PMD to use it. You just turn it on and glide it along your lips like you're seeing me do right now. This device uses a pulsating vacuum technology to remove dead skin and bring blood back to the surface, giving your lips more volume. It's way healthier and safer than just using a toothbrush along. The second step though, is that you're going to now create your own lip balm to hydrate your lips. You're going to mix one table spoon of honey into your tub of Vaseline. You see honey, it is a natural humectant, which means it draws moisture from the environment onto your skin while Vaseline protects the moisture, preventing it from leaving your skin. So when you combine both, you have a natural super product. For hydrating your lips and you see in the study that I previously mentioned, researchers gave all the participants lip injections and then they asked 51 women to gauge whether they were more attractive or less attractive after the lip injection. In every scenario, the pictures of men and women with fuller lips were seen as more attractive. Now, don't run and go get lip injections. That's not what I'm telling you to do. I'm trying to show you how important it is for you to have healthy full lips. And if you are for the kiss system from PMD, which is what I use, you also get hydrating peptides, which are critically proven to increase lip hydration and stimulate skin regeneration through the hyaluronic acid in the product. And finally, and your third step is to reduce all salt intake. You're going to avoid the five saltiest foods, which are deli meats like your salami, instant noodles and ramen, fried foods like chips and chicken, store-bought soups and Chinese food. When you reduce salt intake, you're going to help prevent water retention on your cheeks, making your lips look fuller. However, look, you don't have to completely eliminate all these foods because the PMD Kiss system that I just showed you also comes with a lip plumping serum, which uses a mix of ingredients to produce collagen in your lips so they naturally look more full. Look, as a man, you're not going to go get lip injections and you can spend the rest of your life using the natural routine and the show of you. But if you truly want to get a cheek coat to look more attractive as a guy, you want your lips to look as healthy and as full as possible. And this Kiss system from PMD is a cheek coat that most men have never heard of and you're one of the first guys to do so. So if I were you, I would run, click that link down below, check out the Kiss system and use my code because it's going to make it even more affordable. And watch how you're going to look smacks your face overnight using this tool. Before using Vaseline to eliminate dark eye circles, I apply Vaseline under my eyes every night right before going to sleep to prevent these dark eye circles because I refuse to spend money on expensive eye creams. And you have to understand pure Vaseline is the most effective, occlusive moisturizer in the world, which means it's a moisturizer that prevents hydration from leaving your skin, making it highly effective for treating eye bags in dark circles. This is why you need to use Vaseline every night right before you go to sleep. And I'm going to show you how I do it. First, you're going to lightly dab just a bit on your middle fingers and the top of Vaseline and then lightly dab it under your eyes. Don't rub too hard because this skin is sensitive. You're going to start all the way in the inner corner of your eye and move towards the outer of your eye. Look, it's okay if it's a lot or if it looks really oily or shiny because you're going to sleep with this. Think of it almost as an eye mask. The next morning when you wash your face, you can wash all that excess off and I promise you your eyes will look incredible. Think about it. We've just a couple of Vaseline. You've created the strongest fragrance you'll ever own in your life. You've thickened your eyebrows. You have softer, fuller lips and have now even removed your dark eye circles. You have already transformed your face and your appearance for the better without having to spend it on a whole grooming routine. They still have three more hacks that you can use your Vaseline for that you've never heard of and will make you look amazing. Vaseline will whiten your teeth. You see, most women think just whitening strips and brushing your teeth twice a day is enough to get white teeth. However, both of these approaches are wrong because these just focus on treating stains rather than trying to prevent them. So here's when you're going to use Vaseline to prevent stains in the first place. You're going to start by brushing your teeth as you normally would. Then you're going to dab your fingers into the Vaseline and apply a very thin layer to cover your entire teeth. This is going to create a protective barrier that prevents it from food stains as you eat. Six, use Vaseline slugging to make your skin look fuller and more hydrated to get clear and glowing skin for men. You just got to focus on one thing and it's called Vaseline slugging. However, you should only use Vaseline slugging of areas where your skin actually needs it. So here's where you're going to determine which parts of your face needs Vaseline slugging. And then I want to show you how to use it. First, grab a large dry paper towel from your kitchen. You're going to spread it out and then press it firmly against your entire face for around 30 seconds. Then you're going to remove the paper towel and check for any oil stains. The areas with oil on the paper tile indicate where your face is naturally oily. So what you're going to do now is grab some of that Vaseline and apply it to areas on your face where you notice it was dry or no oil was produced. This will help hydrate those areas. So now you can have an even skin tone that always looks great. Seven Vaseline is a superior exfoliant. I'm still waiting for the day where Vaseline sponsors me because I use it every single time to exfoliate my face. The reason I love using this product for exfoliation is because many store bought exfoliants that you have contain harmful chemicals like your sulfates and your parabens, which end up damaging your skin. So here's how you're going to make a homemade exfoliant using Vaseline. You're going to start by putting two teaspoons of Vaseline into a bowl. You're going to microwave that until it turns into a liquid. Next, you're going to mix one tablespoon of sea salt until it's fully blended. You're going to then pour that mixture back into a small container and let it harden when you're ready to wash your face. Take some of that homemade Vaseline exfoliant. You're going to rinse it under some warm water and then apply it onto your face in circular motions. The granular Vaseline is not only hydrating your skin, but also lifting up any dirt from your pores, making it a superior exfoliant that's going to leave your skin butter soft. I'm telling you guys, what you should do now is run by yourself with jar of Vaseline and try all seven tricks I just showed you. Your face will transform. And if you really want to change your appearance of your face, I would check out that kisses from PMD bro. That is a secret most guys don't know about. See you guys next time."

        "transcript": " You're not popular because you're not understanding the two behaviors that make people actually like you, which are agente and communal. So in today's video, I'm going to show you how to use both agente and communal behaviors to make people like you. Let's talk about part one, what we call agente behavior. This is any action that you do to show confidence. This is the type of behavior that helps you stand out, earn respect, and makes people like you. Make them want to follow you with these four simple techniques. You see, if you do these four things in the order I'm about to show you, you're going to make anyone obsessed with you and your aura. You see, on the left side is how most men act. On the right is the version of you that everyone likes. First, never stand or walk slouched over. Instead, tense your glutes, core, and triceps and make yourself instantly stand straight and upright. Next, never have your shoulders rolled forward. Instead, bring your shoulders back and down and lift your chest up, almost as if there's a string attached to it that's pulling it up to the ceiling. Next, never cross your arms or legs. Instead, keep an open body language. Finally, never walk too fast. Instead, when you start walking, walk slowly. Just look at the difference between before and after. By just doing these four changes, you will completely change your aura and that alone will make people like you and start following you. But to truly become popular, you're going to need to follow the next few techniques I'm about to show you. Never talk when somebody decides to talk to you. When someone is talking to you, it doesn't mean you should immediately start engaging in conversation with them. And this is a common mistake I see almost everyone making. So, the next time someone starts a conversation with you, do this instead to show more confidence. First, when someone starts talking to you, you want to make sure that both your body and your feet are pointed directly towards them. If they're not, it just signals to them that you don't care. Second, you want to maintain strong eye contact at least 80% of the time. If you feel too uncomfortable doing this, you should try looking at the spot right in between their eyebrows and then every five seconds or so, you can glance at their ears to kind of take a break and then come back. Third, you want to nod your head slightly, up and down to show that you're focused and you're engaged in what they're saying. Fourth, you want to give small affirmations like, okay, no way. Wow. These little words are like adlibs. They just show that you understand or that you're interested. And fifth, do not speak right after they finish. Instead, you want to pause for around three seconds to show almost like you're digesting whatever they just said. And it is only after all of this that you should start speaking to show both dominance and confidence. Third, you want to spend 95% of your time on this. You see, true attraction to make people obsessed with you is about 5% of you talking about what you're going to do and 95% of you actually doing it. However, what most people do, they'll spend 95% of the time just talking about what they're going to do and they never follow through for you to become likable. You need to spend 95% of your time doing things and only 5% talking about them. This becomes especially powerful when you do things that most people are afraid of. For example, in social interactions, people are scared of rejection. So here's three steps to overcoming. First, I want you to look for a friendly looking guy in the street and approach him. Then ask him if he can buy you lunch. I promise you 99% of the time, this guy's gonna say no, good. Because after that, you can walk away and realize rejection is not the end of the world. And you need to be able to face it to truly become the confident guy that everybody likes. Look, one of the fastest ways to overcome rejection is to talk through it. Check out a company like BetterHelp which is our sponsor for today. They can help you work through your emotions or find the real causes of your fears because you're going to be speaking to licensed professionals. And by doing it, you're going to overcome these fears faster. Next, I want you to go and look for like an older woman. Ideally, she'll have a ring on her finger. This time, approach her and ask her for her number. Again, 99% of the time, she's gonna say no because she's married or engaged. But because you knew that, you won't care as much and you're gonna start normalizing rejection and won't feel bad about it. And we'll start to desensitize yourself from that fear. And if you pair this with like speaking to a therapist from BetterHelp, you can start talking to them and exploring your emotions as to why you're always feeling intimidated around women. This is a conversation that most of us men can never have with our boys or with our parents or with our brother because you try to internalize it because you have to be massive. But if you have a licensed therapist, you can talk to them in confidence, whether it's through text, a full call, a video call, whatever you feel the most comfortable with, throw the comfort of your room and start battling those fears faster. But once you've gotten here, I want you to take it to the third and final step because at this point, you started to normalize rejection from both men and women by approaching people that you knew were going to say no. To do this, I want you to approach your girl that you actually find interesting and ask for her number. If they say yes, you've scored a number and in the worst case scenario, they'll reject you based on who you are. Ensure it'll sting, but you will get closer and closer to being incentivized from this fear rejection to make you that confident guy that everybody just wants to be around. Again, if you guys want to start talking through this, start talking about your fears of rejecting or what stops you in these social settings from being that confident guy and you can be, I suggest you guys check out BetterHelp which is going to be linked down below. You can go to betterhelp.com.slashtmf and get a special discount for your first month and start talking to a licensed professional today. If you guys want to check it out, it'll be linked down below. Now we're moving on to part two, which is communal behavior. This is whenever you're warm or friendly towards others. This is the kind of behavior that makes people want to be around you that no one talks about, which means it is the most important behavior for you to master if you want to become more popular. So let's move on to number four. You want to make their brains produce dopamine every time they see you. If you want to make someone like you, there is a psychological mind trick you can use to make them produce more dopamine. This will make them addicted to you, but you're going to need to do this correctly. This is based on a psychological phenomenon called the reciprocal liking effect, which states that a person will like you more when they think that you like them. This phenomenon exists because by nature, we as humans were social animals. We need others to survive. So our brains end up producing hormones like oxytocin and dopamine whenever we are around other humans that like us. However, remember I said you have to do it correctly. You see, this can backfire because that liking will not be reciprocated if it's based on three things. If it's insincere, if it restricts our freedom, or if it's inappropriate. So here's what you should never do if you want to show somebody that you like them and make sure that they end up reciprocating that liking back. First, never sit there looking at your phone. Second, never look at her chest or her legs. Third, never sit there with your hands on your face looking away. And fourth, never stand directly in front of her blocking her exit. Always stand off to the side. The best approach here is whenever you're with her, keep your hands visible by keeping them on the table when you're talking to her. You can also make large movements with them when you see them and you're talking to them. Also, when you're listening, make a point of nodding and say things like, aha, okay, or interesting to show them that you like them and then there's genuine interest. Five, say these two lines whenever meeting a girl for the first time. You see, anytime you meet a new girl, there's two lines you should be thinking of. The first one you should use with her, which it's better through text, is there's something intriguing about you. This, I promise you, will instantly spike your interest and you're gonna want to know, what do you find so interesting in her? 99% of the time, she's gonna respond to your text and she's gonna follow up with something like, what do you mean or tell me? And then, you should respond with, I'll tell you on our date, just these two lines are gonna pink her interest. She's not gonna stop thinking about me. Then after a day or two when she asks again, or on the date itself, you can say a line like this, which I promise you, she will laugh, she will find charming, which will make you addicted. Compliment their insecurity to make them obsessed with you. Look, you can easily manipulate people into liking, but that effect will only last a short amount of time. I want people to love you for real. So, to make them love you forever, you need to make that person feel confident by complimenting a deep insecurity they have. Now, no girls is gonna come out and tell you for insecurity. So, here are the five top insecurities most girls have and how to spot them. The first one is teeth. If someone always smiles with their mouth closed, they're insecure about their teeth. The second is hairline or their forehead. If they're constantly wearing hats or pulling their hair forward, they're probably insecure about that. Third is feeling underweight and sometimes a lot of girls will wear long sleeve shirts to hide their arms. Fourth is overweight. If you notice them constantly pulling up their yoga pants or pulling down their shirt, they're probably insecure about their weight. And fifth, it's bad skating. Someone who's frequently touching or covering her face is probably self-conscious about it. Now, once you can recognize that sign on that girl or what her insecurity is, I want you to compliment it. So, here are the five insecurities in the text message or line you can tell the girl in person. If I were you, I would screenshot this and save it in your notes because by you complimenting their deepest insecurity, you're gonna make them feel confident around you and that is the type of person people are obsessed with. If you listen to me and you dolly both these agentric and communal behaviors I just gave you, anybody you meet, will love you."

        "transcript": " Most men don't achieve glass skin because they apply their products out of order or incorrectly. For you to achieve glass skin, you'll have to take care of your skin in the correct order. So today, I'm going to show you my exact seven step glass skin routine. Starting with step number one, open your pores. When it comes to skincare, most men will just put on a face wash and start washing their face. This method is wrong as it doesn't give your pores enough time to open up, making the face wash less effective. You need to open up your pores first because if you don't get out all that dead skin cells and all that built up oil out of there first, you're always going to have skin bumps. So here's the right way to do it. You're going to want to start by cutting a lemon into slices and place two slices into a bowl. Lemons contain citric acid, which helps clean your skin once your pores are open. Next, you're going to want to boil around a liter of water and pour that boiling water into the bowl. Then you're going to place a towel over the back of your head so that it drapes down over the sides of the bowl. You're going to position your hand directly over the bowl and create a personal steam bath for your face. The steam combined with the lemon slices will open your pores properly without causing any skin damage. Now, you can stop at this point in this video and just by doing this, you're going to see a massive improvement on your face within the next 24 hours. But if you really want to achieve glass skin, you need to follow these next six steps in the exact order. Take this to step number two. So stop washing your face with products that foam up. Face washes that produce a lot of foam can be satisfying because you can actually see the product working on your face. But this foam, it's not the best way to cleanse your skin and your pores. Washing your face is the next step in the glass skin routine. So it's crucial that you choose the right face wash. When it comes to cleansing your pores and washing your face, I need you to stay away from any face wash that contains acryl sulfates. Instead, you want to look for products that contain solo-silic acid. For example, the silicilic acid face wash from Geology works well. It's the one I've used for years and it's so good that it's won countless of grooming awards from some of the biggest publications in the world. In other words, the best of the best you can find. And this is because products that foam up, it's just a marketing trick to make you think that the product is working. But the ingredients used to create foam, like the acryl sulfate I mentioned, have been clinically proven to cause irritation and redness. You're going to want to take the face wash, put it on a facial scrubber, don't use your hands and then apply it to your skin, which should be already wet because you just finished the steam bath. Now you're going to gently massage the product into your skin using circular motions working upwards. Now the silicilic acid face wash from Geology is great because it also contains bergamot and juniper. Two ingredients that have been proven to help clean the skin and make it smooth and shiny, almost like glass. If you guys want to check out what I believe to be the best face wash in the market, especially for the price point, I'm going to have Geology linked down below. Now by doing this, you've effectively opened your pores and cleaned them out correctly. This reduces the risk of clogged pores and acne. Most guys will now try to close your pores, but there's one cruiser step you should take first before you do that. Closing to step three, you need to fix your skin with these three natural ingredients. Me focusing on balancing and evening out my skin tone is the best decision I've ever made because few guys ever focus on this. And now that your pores are open, it's the best time to do it. I want you to just look at this before and after. My guy went from a five to a seven just by evening out his skin tone. So here's how you're going to achieve the same results before you close your pores. Start by placing one tablespoon of turmeric in a bowl. Turmeric contains turmeric, which is an active compound, which has been proven to even skin tone color. Next, you're going to want to add one tablespoon of honey into that bowl. Honey has organic acids like nucleic acid that helps unclog pores and even skin texture. And finally, add half a teaspoon of Greek yogurt into the mixture, which contains alpha hydroxy acids, which promotes cell turnover and brightens complexion. You're going to want to mix the ingredients until you get a thick paste. You're then going to apply it to your face and leave it on as a face mask for five minutes. Once it's done, then you will wash your face off with cold water, which will not only clear out the pores, but finally close them as you have now even your skin tone. What I recommend is do this mask only once a week. So I would probably do it Sunday night so you can have great skin complexion throughout the week. 4. Never do these five things when exfoliating your face. If you have dry and flaky skin, you absolutely need to be exfoliating, but only if you know how to do it right. To keep it simple for you, here's a quick list of dos and don'ts when it comes to exfoliating. Don't use a washcloth when exfoliating your body. Instead, use an exfoliating glove that's designed for this purpose. Don't rub your skin harshly from side to side. Instead, use gentle circular motion moving upwards. Don't exfoliate every day. Instead, stick to exfoliating three times a week. To make it easy, you can do it on the same day when you do the face mask, when you balance out your skin tone. Don't use exfoliants that contain crushed walnut shells as these create micro tears in the skin. Instead, choose a product that contains AHA acid, which will exfoliate the skin without damaging it. For example, the micro exfoliator from Geology contains AHA acid. It's one again, one of the best you'll find as it can remove all the dead skin and still leaves your skin hydrated and soft, which is what you want for glass skin. Again, Geology is the best skincare company for men when it comes to products, because they actually design products for your skin problems. If you guys want to check them out, there's a skin quiz down below which you can take, which will let you know what products you need for your specific skin type and skin problems that no other skincare company does. And what you can be rest assured is, when you buy the product, you know you're getting the best of the best. It's not only the same product your boy uses, it's the product that the biggest publications in the world are rating and saying these are the best products for men. And if you check them out and use the link down below, you're gonna get 70% off, which is an absolute steal, especially if you're a guy that truly wants to achieve glass skin. If that's you, click that link down below and check out Geology. Number five, you're gonna shrink your pores with a tea-infused ice dunk. If you're anything like most men, you probably have large, visible pores in your cheeks and in your nose area. Well, I'm here to tell you, there is a scientific way to reduce the size of your visible pores. I want you to pour around 500 milliliters of cold water into a big bowl. I want you to then add a few handfuls of ice so the water gets really cold. Then, depending on your skin type, you're gonna place specific tea bags into that bowl. If you have oily skin, I want you to place green tea bags. This has natural astringent properties that can help reduce the excess oil and shrink your pores. If you have dry skin, I want you to use candlemeal tea bags, as this contains compounds like visible oil, which can help hydrate your dry skin. Now, if you have balanced skin, I want you to use rose tea bags, as this will offer a balance mix of anti-inflammatory and hydrating properties so your skin looks great as you're shrinking your pores. Once you've added the tea, all you gotta do is submerge your face for around 15 seconds. I want you to repeat this process two more times, as this is gonna shrink your pores, stimulate blood flow, and reduce any redness or puffiness getting you closer to glass skin. Now, by now, you've opened your pores with a lemon steam bath. We've cleaned out those pores correctly with a silicylic acid face wash. You then kept the pores open and balanced your skin tone color so your complexion was brighter with a honey face mask. You then exfoliated your skin correctly to get all the dirt out, and now have done an ice bath on your face to shrink all visible pores. Your skin is looking borderline perfect at this point, but if you really want glass skin, you're gonna need these last two steps of the routine. Step number six, I need you to hydrate your skin with the right product at the right time. The key to glass skin is moisturizing, but how you apply it completely depends on your skin type, and this is not just my opinion, this is backed by science. ALA study published in the National Library of Medicine. Researchers had different groups of people apply their moisturizer at varying doses, frequencies, and times of washing. They then compared all the results to see what worked best, and they found that it largely depended on skin type. For those patients that have oily or balanced skin, moisturizing just once a day within five minutes of showering or bathing was enough. Applying more frequently actually ended up reducing the skin's natural oils which are necessary for hydration. However, for those of guys with dry skin, moisturizing twice a day was necessary, and it didn't matter when they moisturize after they bathe. Number seven, protect your skin the Korean way. I'm going to show you five Korean skincare techniques that completely changed my skin and are free. You can start doing them now. You can use every skin care technique and high quality product in the world. You can even use this exact routine, but if you don't protect your skin, you're never going to get a glassy appearance. So you're the five best Korean protection techniques. First, make sure to keep the toothpaste away from the area around your mouth as you're brushing your teeth, as some of the ingredients in your toothpaste, like synthetic surfactants, can cause acne. Second, place a soft towel over your pillow right before you go to sleep to protect your skin from the pillow's fabric and any bacteria left over from the night before. Third, lightly pat your face dry instead of rubbing it every time you dry your skin. Fourth, never wash your face with hot water that's producing steam. Stick to lukewarm water to prevent dryness and damage. And fifth, never use the same towel more than once to prevent any transferring your bacteria. If you do this, you will never have an acne breakout again because you are protecting your skin and if you combine it with the six previous steps, your skin will look flawless and you'll finally achieve the glass skin."

        "transcript": " When you start texting a girl, there are three stages you need to understand to get that girl to like you back through text. So in today's video, I'm going to walk you through all three stages and show you every type of text message you should send a girl. Let's start with phase number one. I call this the icebreaker phase. The icebreaker steak involves every message you're going to send her to help you stand out so you can build rapport with her to make sure she always responds back over the 20 other guys that are also going to be messaging her. Starting with number one, learn how to handle dry textures. Just imagine how many times have you matched with a super attractive girl, but then she starts messaging you with one word responses and never asked you any question. If you're like, no, it's when you're going to assume she's not interested in me. This is wrong. So here's how you deal with a dry texture. First, you're going to start by sending her an opening message like this. Hey, that clothing item you were wearing today was really cool. Now that's just one, but here are a few more opening examples that you can use, which I recommend your screenshot and save. Now, if she continues to reply with these four in one word responses, it could mean she's interested, but she's still testing you, which means you need to follow up with this message to call her out on her behavior. You can say any of these next following lines again, these are risky lines, so only use it in this situation. Now, the idea with these is to playfully tease her and annoy her, which will lead us to the third step, which is gauging her response. If she doesn't respond, there you go. You have your answer. If she responds, but she continues to be dry, cut your losses, focus on another girl. However, if she switches up her communication with you, that is your clear side that she's interested in you. Now, this is only the first time of messages you're going to send a girl, which is dealing with girls that are dry textures. Every guy's been here that by the time you get to the end of it, you're going to know how to make any girl so interested in you. She's going to be begging for you to text her. The status number two, stop messaging these girls on these platforms. It is nearly impossible to get a girl truly interested in you if you're only talking to her on Tinder, Instagram or Snapchat. The reason is simple. On these platforms, you are just one of many. Bro, when she opens up any of these apps to talk to you, she's also talking to a whole other team of guys. You're just one of the bunch, bro. So here are the platforms where girls are going to respond the most and it's more intimate. To start, you need to send her a message that you're going to grab her attention on the platform you're already talking to her. You could try something like any of these two. Usually they get girls to respond because they're more unique. Then you're going to wait at least 12 hours before replying. Once you've done that, I want you to send her this exact message. Sorry for not responding earlier. I don't really check this app much. Want to talk somewhere else instead? Next, you're going to want to move this conversation to the app where you're going to be taken more seriously because there's not a lot of competitors. There's not a lot of guys messaging her on these apps. So here's a ranking of the best apps from least to most effective. And number five, we have Twitter. And fourth place, you have Instagram. And third place, we have Snapchat. And second place, we have WhatsApp. And in first place, it's her phone number. Once you've cleared this, you've now entered phase two of messaging her. By this point, you've already broken the ice with her. You've managed all the dry moments. And now talking to her in a more serious platform. This means it's time to get her obsessed with talking to you. In this obsession phase, you're going to use this third texting technique, which is using deep conversation starters to find shared interests. Shared interests are crucial for developing deeper connections with this girl that you like. So I'm going to show you the questions you should be asking through text to start building this deeper connection. And no, this is not just going to be my opinion. This is all based on science. You see, a recent study revealed that 64% of women considered shared interests as a key factor on deciding whether they wanted to move forward with a relationship. When they analyzed this further, they found that 28% of all physical attraction was based on shared interests. And what this means for you is that if you can show her these shared interests between you and her, you become 28% more attractive than you already are without doing anything else to your appearance. So to develop these deeper connections, you first need to avoid the basic Hey, or how was your day? These are boring texts that destroy meaningful connections. You're going to check out her Instagram and her TikTok accounts. I want you to look at her most recent posts and make a mental list in your head of all the hobbies, interests, or countries she's traveled to. When the time is right, you're going to subtly bring up these topics. I'm going to give you a personal example. It was recently, it was New York Fashion Week here in New York, and I went into a beautifully designed fashion event that was run by Kufani. I've showed you this brand before. It's a great brand for men and women. I was there because I was looking at their upcoming 2025 product line for spring, summer. How are we honest with you? When I was there, I was impressed with the entire lineup. I've been wearing Kufani for a very long time because it's affordable. You can get it on Amazon, easily available, but the designs that they're coming out with, impressive. So if I'm talking to a girl and I know her interest is fashion, for example, a lot of girls in New York love fashion, I would bring this up to her. I would say something along the lines of, Oh, you seem to really like fashion. I actually went to this fashion event the other night. Then I would just send her pictures and videos of the event. We would start talking about the brand and what she thinks about upcoming fashion trends. What does she think about those designs? And now you have a comfortable, normal conversation, but she's building a deeper and deeper connection with you because she's realizing, yo, this guy has the same interest I have. This is how you use this to your advantage. This is also why it's so good to start dressing well as a man. When you dress well, it's so easy to connect with women because every girl wants a guy that looks good and you don't have to break the bank. You don't have to spend a lot of money. Like I was just showing you with the brand Kufani, you as a guy can build an entire outfit for on $150. If you're ordered from Amazon, you can get it in two days. And the great part is that Kufani is consistently dropping new design to make sure you're always looking as stylish as possible without having to break the bank. Look, when I went to the runway show, I was impressed. I was already a fan before, I'm a bigger fan now. If you're a guy that wants to start looking more attractive, start dressing better, but you don't want to have to spend a lot of money, you have to check out Kufani, which I will have linked down below. I'm also going to put a special discount that's going to make the clothes even more affordable. But the point here is, once you've established shared interest, whether it is with your personal style or because of a specific event you went to, she's going to start realizing your boyfriend material, you're the guy she wants to have a relationship with. I want you to look for the five texts that guarantee that she likes you. Look, if a girl texts you with any of these five texts I'm about to show you, it is a clear sign she wants you to ask her out. However, don't take any risks with just one of these texts. You want to make sure that you receive at least three out of the five before you move forward and you ask her out. So in order of interest, if she texting first, with you having to initiate a contact, that's a good sign. That's one good text. If she sends you a good morning or a good night text without you having to prompt it, that's another good text. If she replies to your messages, even when you know she's in class or at work, that is another good text. If she sends you a funny TikTok or Instagram video without you even having to ask, that is an amazing text. And the best one of them all, if she frequently asks what you're doing or what you're doing this weekend, bro, this girl is begging you to ask her out. Now, I want you to understand these texts very well. If you only receive one out of five of these, you're probably just in the front zone. You should not make the first move. If you receive between two or three of these good messages, she's interested, but she's probably also entertaining some other guy. But if you get three or more of these good messages, you're the guy of her dreams, bro. You should make that first move. Now that you've learned how to deal with dry textures, how to talk on the right platforms, how to bring up interest naturally with her and understand what messages to look for, you're finally prepared for the last phase of text message, which I call the flirting stage. The flirting stage is when you move from having her obsessed with you to an actual date. It is the riskiest stage of all because if you jump to conclusions to this stage and you fail, there is no going back, which is why I needed you to understand stages one and two well. Now let's move on to stage three. The fifth type of text message is to learn how to text without looking creepy. If you text like this, she is going to think you're a creep. She's never going to want to go out with you. First, you never want to comment on a girl's appearance when you're texting her. Annemarie, other guy does that and she's going to think you're only into her because of her looks, which you may be, but you don't want her to know that. Instead, I want you to analyze her Instagram and look for these three pictures on her profile. And I promise you, every girl has at least one of these three. And depending on the picture, I'm going to show you what message to send her. If you notice she has pictures on traveling, I want you to use a message like this. If you notice she has a graduation photo, I want you to use a message like this. If you notice she has photos of animals or pets, I want you to use a message like this. Now she's going to see that you're not just another lazy guy and want something more serious with you. But this takes me to the last message you just sent her, which is number six. Use the Martin Luther King technique. This is how you're going to give her butterflies. Engage her interest over text. Now I made this trick myself, so I call it the Martin Luther King technique. And here's how you're going to do it. To start, you need to wait for her to send you the first message. It could be a good morning message or whatever. Then you're going to respond with, how'd you sleep? She'll tell you how she slept and then she'll ask you how you slept. And then this is when you follow up with this. You're going to respond with the technique I'm going to show you and say these exact words. I slept well, but I had a dream last night that you and I, we had a crazy game of mini golf together. Now, when you send that message, it's not risky, but she's going to respond one in three ways. First, she might not even acknowledge it at all and give you some dry response. Like, oh, wow, nice. Or, oh, that was funny. In that case, she's not interested in a date and you shouldn't want it and now you have your answer. However, if she flirts back and responds with something like, oh, who won her? Oh, I'm sure I could beat you. It means that she is open to the idea of a date, which gives you an easy segue to respond with something like, I guess we'll have to do it in person to see who the real winner is. Are you free this weekend? Come on, bro. Who else gives you a game like this? That's why I call it the Martin Luther King technique. I'm telling you, you use this. I have now showed you every type of text message you need to send this girl. And when you use this final trick, you'll get her on a date with you. You're welcome. No one else is teaching me this stuff, bro. See you next time."

        "transcript": " The problem with corn is that it feels incredibly good. So it provides you with a short-term solution for a long-term problem. It also helps you relax when you're stressed, fall asleep when you can't, fight boredom, and even fulfill your wildest fantasy. It makes bad moments feel good and good moments even better. After food and shelter, sex is one of the most important needs for us. So whether you satisfy this need with an actual person or with corn, it will always feel extremely satisfying. Now that I've given corn a fair introduction, let's watch some corn together and see just why it feels so good and what exactly happens on inside your body. First, you need to understand where corn is. See, corn is any kind of material depicting sexual acts or nudity. It's the stuff you find on Cornhub, the pictures on OnlyFans or X, or even the half-naked girls you see on TikTok daily. As soon as you watch that first image of cornography, your brain will start sending signals to your visual and auditory cortex. From there, neomygdalingland will start processing the emotions tied to what you're watching, such as sexual desire. And once this is triggered, your mind will start preparing your body for the act of sex, such as increasing blood flow to your sex organ, releasing lubricant, and increasing adrenaline. At this point, you'll start to feel that your heart rate will increase from its normal state of 75 beats per minute to an increased heart rate of 96 beats per minute. This is where it gets you excited and that your phoric feeling that makes all the problems of your day just fade away. Your brain also begins to produce neuropronephrine, a chemical that similarly acts like adrenaline, which makes you alert and focus into the act that you're doing, that anticipation of having sex or watching cornography. As you watch corn, your brain will also start increasing hormones like oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are meant to bond with your partner, but when you watch cornography, it leads you to bond to specific types of women or specific types of sex. Now you're fully sexually aroused. Your heart rate and breathing will accelerate. Blood flow has fully increased through your genitals, causing an erection. Your muscles will start to tighten, particularly in your pelvic region. And as you reach orgasm, your pelvic muscles will start to contract rhythmically, leading to ejaculation in males. Simultaneously, your brain will release a flood of oxytocin and dopamine, creating an intense feeling of pleasure and euphoria. And as soon as you're done, you exhale out and your brain starts to release serotonin, so you can start to relax. So by now, you've now watched corn and experienced a massive burst of emotions and euphoria. Post-orgasm clarity starts to set in. And now you have increased alertness, focus, and an overall feeling of improvement. It sounds awesome. And that's because it is awesome. However, that doesn't come without a cause. Which is why I'm going to show you the negative effects that come after you're done watching Pocomba. I can't believe you boys just watch porn with me. Listen, that's not what you're supposed to be doing. But in reality, this isn't your only time you guys can watch porn, but it's because I'm trying to make you better. But in reality, if you truly want to level up, you will join the Institute, which is opening today, September 15. Boys, a ton of guys have already reserved their spots. So we only have limited slots left. That means for those of you that have been wanting to join the Institute, now it's your time to click the link down below and get a seven day trial for just a dollar and join the mission of creating the world's best men's community. See you inside. You see, all the chemicals and emotions that you just experienced for those few minutes as you watch porn, they bring short-term happiness and fulfillment. When you're done, your mind and your body, they try to return to normal. This is called homeostasis. And it's crucial for your survival and long-term happiness. But here's the problem. Your brain will now crave that sexual stimulation again. And now your face with two options. You can go outside and risk rejection in pursuit of sex with the real person, or you can simply pull out your phone and experience that same natural high, whatever you want. But your decision-making skills have been fried because every time you watch porn, your brain gets flooded with dopamine, causing your reward system to become hyper-stimulating and imbalanced. Over time, your brain is fighting for its black to try to restore balance by becoming less receptive to the dopamine. This process is known as desensitization. And as this continues, your ability to experience enjoyment from things that used to bring you enjoyment like sex and the porn you've been watching starts to disappear, which means that to achieve the same level of arousal and euphoria and pleasure, you will start to watch more and more unusual forms of pornography. You see, back in 2007, when Courthub first launched, some of the most common search terms were amateur and celebrity names like Paris Hilton or Megan Fox. In 2023, the top sex searches were robot, sex machine, and sexing granny. And according to a recent study published by Science Direct, searches related to sexual assault are on the rise. The point is that the more you watch porn, the more obscure and extreme your preferences become. Now, you don't find happiness in anything. You become a shadow of the man you once were, and your brain is fighting for its life to try to return to normal. With all that negative side effect, why don't people just stop watching porn, right? Well, it's not that easy. And although a lot of porn watchers are often seen as weak-minded, that's not necessarily fair to say. You see, sexual cravings are one of the strongest and most basic urges known to mankind. When the risks of satisfying that craving are weighed against the need of just simply pulling out your phone, it's so easy to see how long-term dependence and even addiction can form. Today, about 75% of teens are watching porn. And although every porn watcher has sexual craving, not every guy that has sexual cravings watches porn. So, I'm going to show you how to become that guy and overcome your court addiction. First, you will replace porn with friends. When you watch porn, your brain releases chemicals like dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins. This is what makes you feel good and makes it so hard to quit. To never watch porn again, you need to replace it with three activities that release the same hormones. To start, you can start producing moderate levels of dopamine when you hang out with friends or family. However, you and your friends will produce even more dopamine if all of you together work towards a common goal. For example, I do this with you guys all the time here in New York City. I grab my followers and we go for like 10 mile runs through the city because I know if I work together as a brotherhood, I'm gonna get them focused on the goal and not on bad habits that they're trying to overcome. This is stuff that most of you don't realize. This is why we're creating the Institute, the best-meant online community to ever exist. And as a matter of fact, it's launching today, September 15, where you can sign up for just a dollar. If I were you, I would run before slots sell out. The next hormone is oxytocin, which is typically released during sexual arousal or physical touch. However, research has found that deep and meaningful connections can also help release high levels of oxytocin. One of the best ways to do this is to travel because you and if you have friends, you and your friends, will be put in situations that are one of a kind that you'll never experience in your life. That shoots up your oxytocin. Pornography will be the last thing on your mind. Now, I know where most are thinking, well, I don't have the money to travel. I got you, bro. Now, everyone has the capacity to spend money. This is why I'm going to pay for you to travel at least once a month. When you're part of our brotherhood, the Institute, I'm going to be choosing 10 guys from the Institute, every single one to come with me and travel around the world. And you can sign up now for a seven day trial for just a dollar. That is only going to be 50 bucks a month. $50 a month to be part of the best men's community of men that are consistently trying to better themselves. You won't find this anywhere else. Now, the third hormone are endorphins. Typically, this is released through exercise or also through laughter. And of course, to make yourself laugh, you can watch it on Netflix special. You can go to a comedy club. You can go with friends to a comedy club. Because let's be honest, the more time you spend with your friends, the more likely you're to be laughing, having great times and producing more endorphins. The key here is to build long lasting relationship with high quality men. Build a brotherhood. Your problem is that you're locked up in your room. I need you out of there. This is why I'm doing the Institute that's dropping today. You can do a one week trial for a dollar. Get in, become a part of it. And after that, it's only 50 bucks a month, bro. That's nothing to be part of the best men's community on the planet that will help you overcome your bad habits, that will get you in the right mindset. Where you'll be surrounded with other men that equally want to be the best version of themselves. For those of you that I'm talking to, it's not that you want to join. You must join. Click that link down below now. Take action. Number two, determine what type of porn watcher you are. To start removing pornography from your life, you need to see where you land on the spectrum of pornography users. On the left, you have the low risk users. These are the men that just look at half naked women on social media apps. Moving up, you have men that sign up to own the fence. Then you have regular porn watchers followed by fetish watchers. And finally, violent porn watchers. Where most men go wrong when it comes to quitting is that they try to quit completely porn, which is what leads to most of you almost always relapsing. Instead, determine where you are on this spectrum. And then try to just go down one level. Do it left for a week and then try to go down another level until you fully get rid of porn. And finally, number three, understand that pornography users are a sign that you're a strong man. A lot of people believe that when you watch pornography, it's a sign that you're a low quality guy. But I'm going to show you why this isn't true with porn. To start, I want you to take a look at this video from one of the world's strongest men. Every single month, I have been spending any and every last bit of extra money that I have come in monthly on campsites, on online paid porn, on models. And it has not only compromised my relationship, but my future. Blaring wheels in no way is a beta. No guy will see that through his face, yet he's out here openly admitting what he's struggling with, placing him in the spectrum of only fans watching. Listen, it's not easy at first because you just go, what else am I going to do? But I had to literally write down things that I was going to do instead of watch pornography. It was that simple. It was like, okay, I am going to read a book right now. And I'll be on the first paragraph like, ah, second paragraph is interesting. Third one, I'm like, wow. Again, another dude, world-class bodybuilder and actor, openly admitting to his pornography problem. I try to stay off of pornography, man. That's one of my biggest arch nemesis is pornography. Why? Because it just weakens me. It just, yeah. How so? I put all my sexual, you know, my fantasies and stuff. They're not mine anymore. I'm laughing because he's using his body, so he says something and then he's setting up a joke. But the OVAD also openly admitting it to it on a major platform. The point is that porn is an issue that many hyper successful men deal with, not just low quality guys. So the next time you feel like crap because you can't get over porn, I want you to take a look at this list of names I'm putting on screen now. All of these guys publicly admitted to consistently battle with pornography addiction. Whatever you feel an adequate or weak, remember this list. You're not weak. You're normal like every other guy. And if you truly want to level up, you should be surrounded by other high quality men with your mindset. I need you to join my mission to create the strongest brother of the best men's community and we're created online. And join the Institute, which I would have linked down below. You can join for just a dollar, bro. I'll see you inside."

        "transcript": " If you can give me 10 minutes of your time, I can make you more attractive. And I'm not talking about just, oh, do some skincare, fix your style. That's obvious. You know you should do that. What I'm gonna show you are the seven layers that every man must remove to truly see just how attractive they are. Starting with number one, clear your skin with sea salt spray. Your acne is that first layer that's holding you back from being truly attractive. To get rid of acne very quickly, you need to use a homemade sea salt spray. You're standing three things. Salt, warm water, and a spray bottle. First, you're gonna fill your spray bottle with warm water. Then you're gonna mix in two tablespoons of sea salt. Finally, once it's mixed, you're gonna spray this mixture directly on your acne and leave it on overnight as a mask. What the salt water will do is absorb excess oil from your skin, drying out your pimples. Now, I do recommend don't overuse this. Use it like once or twice a week because it ends up over drying your skin if you use it too frequently. But just think about it, bro. I just stripped away the one thing that's holding you back from being insanely attractive. And I have six more layers. I wanna strip from you to truly show you just how attractive you are. Number one to number two, you're gonna get a six pack in just 30 minutes. If you're overweight and you don't have a six pack, you're actually in an advantage. Unlike other dudes, you can jog from a three out of 10 to a seven out of 10 by just losing 30 pounds and getting a six pack. Any clothes you put on will look amazing on you and your face shape will completely transform. So the fastest way to burn this layer of fat is by exercising for only 30 minutes a day. You see, research conducted found that those participants that exercise for just 30 minutes a day ended up losing 3.6 kilos and weight in three months. While the guys that were spending one hour a day only lost 2.7 kilos. The reason for this is because when you exercise for 30 minutes, it becomes doable. This is the key to losing weight and getting a six pack. You need to find a way to make exercising so easy you can stay consistent with it. And this September 15th, I'm launching what I consider to be the world's best community that I'm calling the Institute. That is my goal. To have guys that are hungry for self-improvement, to make themselves better, to push them to become better through experience led learning. You're not gonna learn from a course, courses don't work, you're not gonna learn like you learned in a classroom. You're gonna learn by actually doing the things with a brotherhood of guys that are actually supporting you. These are the type of friends you need around you. This is why it's gonna be the best community in the world boys. We're launching tomorrow the Institute. Thousands of guys have reserved their spot, meaning there's only a few slots left. If you wait till tomorrow, you have to run when that video drops and hope you get a slot because these slots will sell out. If I were you, I would run down, click the link down below and reserve your slot for a dollar so you can get that seven day trial. After that, it's just 50 bucks a month and you're gonna be part of a mission that's gonna change a whole generation of men. For those of you that are ready, click that link down below. Number three, use olive oil to clear your bad breath. Most of you probably think that just brushing your teeth is enough to prevent bad breath. It is not. You need to start doing this oil pulling technique that will not only kill your bad breath, but also improves the health of your gum and your teeth. First, you're going to grab an edible oil. You can use either coconut or olive oil. You're then gonna take two tablespoons and swish it around in your mouth between 15 and 20 minutes. Now, this is the only time I'm ever gonna tell you to do them scroll or grab your phone, go on TikTok, pick whatever app you enjoy best as this is gonna help you kill time and make it go by faster. But if you start doing this every day after dinner at the end of your day in just 15 days, you will notice you'll never have bad breath again. Now think about this, bro. So far, I've taken you and I've removed a layer of acne, a layer of fat and a layer of bad breath. You see why I'm telling you? You're way more attractive than you think you are. And just like I promised, if you just give me another six minutes, I will finish proving to you just how attractive you really are by removing the four final layers. Like number four, you're gonna fix your height using the nerd neck technique. I'm about to add an extra inch to your height instantly in just 45 seconds. You see, many of you have a rounded nerd neck from sitting and staring at a computer screen or your phone all day. And if you don't fix this, you're going to look shorter and less attractive. So here's how you're gonna fix it using what I call the nerd neck routine. You're gonna start by tucking your chin down, making it touch your chest and holding it for five seconds. Then you will turn your head as far as you can to the right and then hold for five seconds. Then you will do that to the left and then hold for five seconds. And lastly, you will push your head backwards as far as you can and hold for five seconds. I want you to do this stretch every day for three sets at the end of your day to counteract the bad posture of you being on your phone all day. And I promise you, you will add an inch to your height. Number five, follow this to never smell bad again. You see most men stink because you don't understand how your body works. But if you can understand these three things I'm about to show you about your body, you will eliminate bad odor forever. First, stop eating foods that change the composition of your sweat. Look, everybody sweats everywhere, even that hot girl you're looking for. However, not everybody's sweat has a bad smell. The difference is that certain people eat foods that change the composition of your sweat that ends up causing you to stink. Eating foods like onions, garlic, or asparagus changes the composition of your sweat before it's even secreted. Meaning that you start smelling worse than everyone else. And a lot of guys overlook the importance of diet and habits when it comes to their personal hygiene. But if you are a man of our brotherhood, the Institute, we're gonna be focusing on all these little details because I know how small changes can have the biggest impact on how you look. It's about paying attention to the small things that others miss. It's about standing out from everyone else. That is what we're gonna be learning in the brotherhood. And if you wanna join, I would reserve your spot today for a dollar because this Saturday, November 15th when it launches, those slots are gonna fill out fast. The second thing is something you've never heard of, you probably have. It's called dermatitis neglectum. And they are basically dark patches of dead skin around your body and they cause horrible body odor. Now, if you wanna test if you haven't, I want you to grab your finger, do this test with me and rub the back of your ear as hard as you can. If you see anything like black little dust on your finger, that is a collection of dead skin cells. And bro, that's disgusting, you need to go shower and don't even stop there. I want you to look at your elbows and your knees. If those are dark, you probably have it there as well. So you wanna know the fix? It's simple, get in the shower and actually scrub these areas. Don't just let the soapy water run on your body and assume you're gonna be clean. And third, your deodorant is not effective. The reason why it's not working is that every time you apply deodorant, you're not actually killing the bacteria that's under your arms that's causing the bad scent. You're just masking it. So to fix this and destroy the bacteria, I want you to apply a little bit of benzoyl peroxide under each armpit, then wash it off in the shower and then apply deodorant. And you're gonna notice that any deodorant you use from now on will actually start working for you. That's world number six. I want you to remove two types of stains that you have on your teeth. Regular toothpaste and glossing alone will not get you the white smile you're looking for. So here's how you can whiten your teeth at home with two simple ingredients. But first, you need to understand whether you have intrinsic or extrinsic staining on your teeth. Intrinsic staining is deep within the tooth and the only way to whiten this is at a doctor's office. But extrinsic staining, this can be fixed at home because this is just the outer layer of your tooth. So what you're gonna do is grab a tablespoon of baking soda and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide. You'll wanna pour just enough hydrogen peroxide until the baking soda fills this pasty-like consistency. You will then brush your teeth with this paste, but before you spit it out or rinse it out, I want you to leave it on your teeth for about a minute, almost like a mask. Then just rinse it out normally. I want you to start using this around once a month at most once every other week because it's gonna make your teeth too sensitive. But I promise you, your teeth will be white. You have now eliminated the six layers that were keeping you ugly. I'm proving to you just how attractive you are, but there is one final layer I need you to get rid of. This is number seven. You only need a five-minute morning routine. I'm gonna show you a five-minute routine to get out of your house quickly and always look great because the final thing that's keeping you ugly is that you're not consistent with your hygienic routines because you think it takes too long. So all you're gonna do is first, you will step in the shower and use the Navy shower technique which should only take you 60 seconds. To start, you will turn on the water for 15 seconds and rinse your whole body, then turn it off. Then you're gonna spend about 30 seconds putting on body wash, face wash, and shampoo. Then you're gonna turn the shower on again and for around 25 seconds, finish rinsing off everything on your body. Step two, step out the shower and find a two-in-one product that has a high-quality moisturizer and a high-quality SPF. You will then apply a coin-silenced amount on each of your cheeks because that's all you need. Step three, you're then gonna brush your teeth for around a minute and 30 seconds. After you're done, you're gonna rinse your toothbrush and for the last 30 seconds, you're gonna brush your lips to soften them. Step four, you're gonna apply a fragrance. You wanna do a spray on each wrist and then on each side of the neck. It's that simple. When you have a morning routine that's down and consistent, you're gonna start every day looking attractive. These are the kind of habits we're gonna be building inside the Institute with our brotherhood. Little habits that's gonna make all of us greater and because you now have a brotherhood of guys that are pushing you to greatness. For the first time in your life, you will actually be consistent and start leveling up. For instance, the Institute drops this Saturday, September 15. Those slots are gonna sell out. If I were you, I'd rush down below and for a dollar, reserve your spot before slots sell out. But even if you don't enjoy the Institute with the seven layers we got rid of today and in just 10 minutes, I've proven to you just how attractive you are."

        "transcript": " As an introverted guy, you have this natural aura of mystery and coolness that any girl will be attracted to. But it only works if you use it correctly. So if you are an introvert, this is the most important video you're ever going to watch today. Because I'm going to take the things that you already are doing and elevate them to amplify your aura and become attractive. Starting with number one, I want you to keep avoiding eye contact. You can have confident eye contact by not looking directly into her eyes. And this is important because eye contact has always been one of the quickest ways for a woman to determine how competent or confident a man is. So here is how you confidently maintain eye contact with a woman using four techniques. First, avoid looking directly into her eyes. This is awkward. Instead, I want you to look elsewhere on her face, like the middle of her nose or in between her eyebrows. Second, rather than just looking directly into her eyes, try to focus on another area of her face or body. You can try to see if she's wearing a particular jewelry or if she has a new hairstyle. If she ends up asking, what are you looking at? This is great because it ends up being a natural segway into a genuine compliment. Third, if you're going to look away, glance to the side rather than looking down. And fourth, if you're going to break eye contact, do it naturally by making some sort of facial expression or changing your body language. Number two, amplify your physical aura. 99% of men still don't understand that small changes you make to your looks can drastically improve your appearance. So here are three simple things every man can do to their face to look more attractive. First, I need you to think in your eyebrows. Now you can do this naturally by using a derma roller and then applying minoxidil right afterwards. Two, hydrate your lips. Chapped lips are a major turnoff and will make you unapproachable. So opt for a lip balm that has SPF. And third, steam your face every day. Doing this will release all the dirt, grime and dead skin that builds up inside your pores. I recommend do it right before you do your skincare routine for optimal results. You see what's happening right now? Up until now, using your introvertiveness by avoiding eye contact and just improving your appearance, you're already becoming more desirable. This is what I want you to realize. Being an introvert is a superpower and you have seven more superpowers that you don't even know you have, but I'm going to develop. States of the number three, just stop making friends. Literally any introvert can increase their attractiveness and go from a two to a 10 in less than three months. And here's how you're going to do it. You see, women are naturally drawn to men that have a strong social circle. Now it doesn't matter how many friends you have, what matters is the quality of your social circle. And as introverts, you and I, we're wired to connect on a deeper level. Which is why casual friendships feel exhausting and they always kind of die off. From my experience, the best connections you'll have are from places where you're doing a particular hobby you enjoy. For example, I love doing jits, so making deep connections and new friends within that community is easy for me. But here's the thing for most people, finding that location becomes difficult. In school, it usually becomes very difficult to find those meaningful connections, especially for somebody like you that's constantly trying to grow. You watch these videos, you're on self-improvement. Finding other guys that have that mindset is impossible. Because every other guy makes excuses for their life. You're not that type of guy. And that's why I'm on a mission to create the best community of men ever created with men that have your mindset, that have my mindset. That way we're constantly surrounded by other guys that are equally pushing us. This is what keeps you motivated. This is what keeps your discipline. And no one else has created something like this before. This community. I'm calling it the Institute. And it's dropping September 15th. Yo, we're less than two weeks away. And I'm telling you right now, the amount of interest I've had for this community is incredible. Meaning, slots are going to sell out. But there's been thousands of you that have already reserved their spot for just a dollar. Now, it's not too late. If you're that type of guy that wants to join the mission of creating a community so powerful where you can connect and build a meaningful network, I want you to join the Institute. And I want you to reserve your spot today for a dollar. So when we launched September 15th, you got nothing to worry about. If slots sell out because everybody else was too slow, you acted quickly. And that's the type of guy we need in the community. So if you want to join the mission, the link will be down below. Fourth, use shyness as your signal. I will show you how to stop being shy and awkward forever. Whenever you're in a conversation and you feel that urge to kind of retreat into silence or to be shy, use it as a signal to implement this trick I'm about to show you. All you got to do is say one extra sentence in that conversation. Maybe it's about the song that's playing or maybe it's about the weather. It's been off to everyone has that exact extra sentence in their head that they want to say. But most people suppress it because they feel shy. I want you to say it. Let me give you an example. If a girl tells you, oh, I'm just going to go out to eat with some friends. You can say something basic like, oh, I've never tried that before. But I want you to say that extra sentence. Follow that up with, oh, what's your favorite plate to order? I'm inviting you to try something new. Doing this will make you more reliable and help you connect with others. Number five, don't send text messages. Never send the girl you like these three text messages. If you're an introverted guy, one, hey, what's up? Two, do you want to hang out? And three, hey, did you see my last message? Look, you might find it easier to communicate through social media or through text messages rather than in person. However, over relying on digital communication with these simple messages will turn off any girl. Instead, I want you to switch it up and try using voice notes whenever you're in a conversation with a girl. This is going to speed up the process to develop a deep conversation with a woman. And also, you're going to see more direct and confident. Number six, every man needs these two hobbies. If you're an introverted man, you need these two hobbies if you want to improve your life. You need a creative hobby and a social hobby. For the creative hobby, you want something that gives you a mental challenge and puts your brain to work. This could be drawing, photography, music, videography. For me, it's content creation. I love making videos. I love helping dudes out. And not to mention, most of the times, your creative hobby can end up becoming your career. The second hobby you need is a social hobby, something that forces you to interact with others and develop your communication. And the best way to do this is to find other people that have a group that have similar interests to yours. For example, I'm not going on long runs, which is why I developed a group of guys here in New York City where they just follow me and we run around the city. We all have the same interests. And I get it. Finding that social hobby can be kind of difficult. That's why I'm on this mission with the Institute. Too many guys are doom-scrolling in their bedroom with no way out. The Institute is going to be more than a place to just meet. There'll be a brotherhood, a family of ambitious and dedicated men that want to grow. And the best part is, I'm going to be hosting meetups and events all around the world, India, Singapore, New York, Mexico City, wherever in the world we want to be hosting meetups. And every month, lucky participants will be chosen where I'm going to be paying all your expenses and flying you out so we can learn from those cities. Create experiences that you will never have in your life because you're just doom-scrolling on your phone. This is what's going to grow you as a man. This is how you're supposed to learn, not through a course or a classroom. The Institute will change the game forever, not just for your life, but if you join, you will be changing the lives of thousands if not millions of men. Boys, this mission launches September 15th because you're a man of action. I want you to click the link down below and reserve your spot for just a dollar. After that, every month, it's just going to be 50 bucks. I want to see you boys inside. But by now, as an introverted guy, you learn how to look more confident without eye contact, how to amplify your physical aura, how to stop making useless friends, how to use your shyness as a superpower. And now, I've even showed you what hobbies you need to excel in life. But to truly max your superpower out as an introvert, there are three final things you need to complete. Take even number seven, never tell her you like her. This is one of the biggest mistakes introverted men make. You see, as an introvert, you often wait for the other girl to make the first move. But when it comes to dating, initiative is key. But if you're going to make that first step, you have to do it correctly. So instead of calling her directly over the phone and telling her exactly how you feel, you should just tell her you want to hang out. The mistake introverts make is that they'll call a girl and tell her exactly how they feel, oh, I like you so much. I hope you like me back. When you do this, you're giving her what is called masculine energy. It's energy that's very direct. That's how men communicate. But it puts women in this high pressure environment where it's more likely that she's just going to say, no, she doesn't want to deal with that pressure. But when you just ask her casually to hang out, to study or go grab some lunch, she'll know you're interested in her. But you're not being as aggressive in the ass, which makes it much more likely for her wanting to say yes. For A, you can be an introvert and not be socially awkward. You have to understand that your energy as an introvert is different than that from an extrovert. And I know this personally because I am an introvert. Most guys don't believe this, but your boy's an introvert, even though I talk to millions of you every single day. You see, as an introvert, when you wake up, you have a limited amount of social energy. And as you start interacting with people throughout the day, that energy level starts to drop, leaving you feeling drained after a long day of socializing. On the flip side, if you're an extrovert, you wake up with no social energy whatsoever and you start gaining it as you start interacting with multiple people throughout the day. This is why as an introvert, you need to schedule time for yourself to recharge throughout the day. This doesn't mean you should isolate yourself in the bedroom completely. What it means is you should take five to 10 minutes throughout the day where you can just go into a quiet place, listen to the music you want, read the book you like, and be able to recharge that social battery. It takes us to number nine. You need to learn how to calm yourself every time you're overthinking. The fastest way to stop overthinking in real time is using something called the psychological sign. You have to understand that overthinking as an introvert, it can lead you to be indecisive and nothing is more unattractive than a man that doesn't know what he wants. So next time you're overthinking and you want to do the psychological sign, you're going to start by doing one deep breath, try to fill in your lungs, followed by a quick extra breath to try to top off your lungs. And finally, followed by a long exhale. The reason why this works is because the double inhale inflates the sacs of your lungs and the long exhale rid your body and bloodstream of any carbon dioxide, which relaxes you quickly. This is the fastest way to eliminate any stressful response in your body, especially as an introvert when you can start overthinking things every time you socialize. If you made it here to the end, you now know that your introvertedness is a superpower. But if you truly want to take it to the next level, I want you to join our community. Institute to truly develop your full potential. Sing your boys inside."

        "transcript": " What if I told you that it's easy to get ahead of 99% of people? And this is because there are only three levels that you're going to be facing to get to the top 1%. Level 1, the comfort zone. Level 2, the fear zone. And level 3, the growth zone. And in today's video, I will show you a step-by-step guide on how to clear each level. And you'll see that it takes you less than 5 minutes a day. Start with level 1, the comfort zone. 99% of people are in this level. But only 50% of you will make it past this level. And there are two things you need to understand to make it into the fear zone. Number 1, you have discipline. You just don't know where to put it. Every single one of you has discipline. Or at least you have the ability to be disciplined in something. You just don't know where to put it. You see, a lot of guys make the mistake that they don't even know what their goals are, right? You'll see a successful guy, he's always on their phone, so you'll assume, oh, I got to do the same. But what ends up happening is that the goals that you create, based on the people that you see on your phone, often are unattainable. Making you want to stay comfortable in this zone and never even try. But if you realistically figure out what goals you want, and you can realistically achieve them yourself, you're going to see discipline come out like you've never had before. And this is exactly what I'm trying to do with the Institute that launches September 15th. It is a brotherhood where we'll travel around the world, learn from real-world experiences, and grow together as one. Which I'm going to show you the benefits of that later on in this video. But when you find that purpose as a man, to become unstoppable, motivation, it will be limitless. Which exactly takes me to my next point. Number two, the truth about motivation. If you're not motivated, for two reasons. It's either you don't like what you're doing, or you don't understand the reason why you're doing it. Take your parents, for example. When they wake up early to go to work, they don't need your typical motivation. They understand the necessity, the why. Because with that work, they can't pay for the help. They can't feed you or themselves, or they can't have clothes to wear. The problem is, you don't have these pressures on you. I can guarantee you that if you have a family, and you knew that they were coming up short, let's say on their house payment, they couldn't pay their house, you would figure out how to make money. You need to find what drives you. And then you need to understand why you're doing that something. As this is going to fuel your motivation. And once you do, I want you to use a trick called Streaks to build discipline. Just like apps like Snapchat and Duolingo do. I want you to grab a physical calendar, and mark it every day you complete that task to create a visual representation of your progress. This taps into the sunken cost fallacy. Once you've invested time in maintaining a streak, you're more likely to keep it up, because you don't want to lose all your progress. Now, you understand the truth about motivation by understanding that you already have discipline. And the truth and motivation, you can now overcome procrastination and start moving into the next zone, which is the fear zone. When you have to follow everything I'm telling you, or you're going to get stuck with the 99%, it's truly that easy. And if you want to make it easier, surround yourself with other guys that are just as hungry to have the same mindset. That's what we want to do with our brotherhood, with the Institute. I want those guys that are hungry, that want to connect with other guys, because it is your loneliness. It is the fact that you're stuck in your room with nothing to do that's stopping you from growing. Look, we're launching September 15th, but you can reserve your spot today for a dollar. That dollar will give you a seven day trial where you can get in, get used to it, and then it's just 15 bucks a month. That's nothing. Considering we're going to be traveling the world, I'm going to be selecting 10 of you every single month to go somewhere, Tokyo, Paris, New York, pay hotel, pay flights, pay everything, so we can all learn together. If you guys want to reserve your spot, I would run now. Click the link down below. But let's move on to level two, the fear zone. 50% of people will make it here, and only 1% will make it out of here. This is the most difficult part of the journey, not because it's hard, but because fear is going to sink in, and it's going to kill all your potential. Takes us to number three, your family will treat you differently. The first fearful hurdle you're going to cross is when you decide to make a significant change in your life, such as, let's say quitting video games to pick up weightlifting. You're going to experience a psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance. This occurs when your actions begin to contradict previous beliefs and behavior. For example, let's say you're a longtime video gamer. Chances are you've expressed how much you love video games. You recommend games to your friends, and you've experienced immense joy every time you play them. But at some point, you realize gaming was consuming too much of your time. It was becoming detrimental to you. So you decide to quit. You watch one of my videos, and you start embracing healthier hobbies like weightlifting. This shift is what creates cognitive dissonance as you now reflect on your new actions against all your old beliefs. So during this transition, your family, your friends, they might treat you differently, and it's not about them being unsupportive. It's about them adjusting to the new you. They have no new one way for so long that this sudden change, it's going to be unsettling for them. They may even question your choices, express concern, making you doubt whether you're even making the right decision. This is natural. Smoothness to number four, you have to cut off your friends. Most men, they're afraid to cut off their bad friends, which is why so many will quit at this level. So to make it as simple as possible, I want to do a tier list of all the friends you should avoid, and which ones are the ones you should surround yourself with. So let's start with these guys. All right, let's move these guys into the D tier category. These are the most dangerous people in your inner circle. Friends who are ambitious, yet very lazy. It's the worst type of friend to have because these are the guys that constantly wait for opportunities to come instead of working towards them. Next up, all right, let's move these guys into the C tier. These are the friends that are always busy, but in reality, they're just addicted to social media and doom scrolling. These are the guys that prefer to stay home versus work with you towards some bigger vision. All right, next up, these flaky guys into B tier. These are the type of friends that are, they're somewhat reliable, but they're flaky. You can't fully count on them. This is the type of guy that he'll go to the gym with you for a week and then out of nowhere, suddenly stop going with. They lack consistency. Now, these aren't the worst friends to have, but they're not the ones that you can truly rely on when life gets tough. All right, let's move the listener, move this type of friend up to the A tier. Yeah, these are good because this is the type of friend who's open to talking to you, to hearing you out. They pay attention to what you say, to what's going on and they're just a great active listener. And finally, the supportive guy. This dude is S tier, God tier. This is the friend that's ultra reliable. They're inspiring, they're supportive. These are the type of friends that you can comfortably share your success with them and they're going to celebrate with you. They're not going to be envious of you. These are also the type of friends that are often focused on self-development like you are. In other words, they're like-minded like you. And I know you're probably hearing this and thinking, damn, I don't have anybody that looks like that. Yeah, because an S tier type of friend, they're one in a million. They're not only hard to find, but because you can't find people that are like-minded to you, it's very easy to start feeling lonely like nobody fully understands your journey and your growth. That's what I'm trying to solve with the Institute. That's why I'm on this mission. September 15th, we're less than a week away from launch. My goal is to get guys like you, guys like me, that are obsessed with self-development and growth together in the world's best community so we can all grow together and push each other, have great experiences, and actually connect with guys that fully understand you. Bro, if you feel like you're already part of this mission, you know you want to be that guy, don't wait till September 15th. Those swaths are going to fill out. You're the type of guy that takes action. So I would click the link down below, reserve your slot for a dollar. You're going to get a seven-day free trial where you can see how great the community is. And after that, it's just $50 a month, and you're going to be on the world's greatest mission to change a whole generation of men. See your boys inside. By making it past the conference zone and the fear zone, you're past 90% of the entire population. You just passed the two hardest zones where most quit. And now there's only one more zone you need to cross to be a 1% guy. Level three, the growth zone. Only 1% of people ever make it here. And they remain here because of certain habits and traits that they possess, which takes me to tip number five. Behave like the 1% behave. And this is where I want you to start acting richer than you actually are. Look, since I moved to New York, I've been to almost every expensive club. The most expensive one, Amman, cost $200,000 a year as a membership. And I've had tons of conversations with wealthy people and I've seen a lot of internal and external habits of how they act. The crazy part is that they're free. Anybody can act this way. Anybody can do these. I want to share with you five of these that all of you can start doing. One, successful people don't just surround themselves with people that have made it. Instead, they also form strong connections with people who are on a similar journey as they are. So they can support and motivate each other. They are on the same level of hunger, same level of grind. They share the same struggles. They celebrate wins together. For you, you can do the same. That's what I'm trying to do with the Institute, building the best men's community online of men that are hungry to grow. Two, they lead no role for negativity in their schedule. To achieve their goals, they're very selective about how they spend their time. Three, rather than jumping in with solutions right away, they spend most of their time listening and understanding situations. It's almost like they dedicate 70% of the time to listen and only 30% of the time talking. Four, this one was so funny to me. They almost always introduced themselves to people using their first and last name. It's almost too like established their importance or their presence. And five, they break down their thoughts into the most simplest terms so anyone can understand it. They do this so they can open up as many opportunities or partnerships as possible, as they want to do business with other wealthy medics. A great example of this is Steve Altmuss. The dude's a genius, but anytime you listen to him, is he's easy to understand. Understanding these habits of the top 1% will get you acting like the rich, even if you don't have the money. Ultimately, it takes me to number six. You have to specialize in one skill. If you are 20 years old and you want to become a millionaire, here is the fastest way. Forget about the money. You need to understand that your first 10 clients or your first job should be paying you with experience, not money. There's a guy on TikTok and on YouTube. He's called SB Mowing. And all he does is post himself cutting other people's lawns for free. They're overgrown lawns. And all those views he gets are then leads that he uses to sell merch and sell his landscaping services. The reason I'm telling you this is because too many guys go into this money-hungry mindset thinking that they know everything already. The truth is that you don't. You need to find a skill and then specialize in it and the only way you can do that is by doing it repeatedly for people and getting good results. Now, if you truly pay attention to everything I said in this video, you understand how to get past 99% of people. And you also realize that most of these things will take you less than five minutes a day to do. For those of you ready to take action, I'll see you inside the Institute. Dropping September 15th. I'll have a link down below."

        "transcript": " Life is a lab where any man can rise or fall. Now, most creators, they'll teach you how to climb the lab. I will take a different approach. I'm gonna show you the quickest way to ruin your life and fall to the bottom with these seven bad habits. Number one, do the opposite of what society tells you to do. You see, society places expectations on every man, so to ruin your life, you'll wanna make sure to do exactly the opposite of what society expects you to do for your certain age. You see, from 14 to 22 years old, society expects you to have a good GPA. So if you wanna ruin your life quickly, keep it under 2.0. From 18 to 22 years old, society expects you to go to a great college. So don't go to college at all. Between the ages of 22 and 26, society expects you to meet a high quality girl. So to hit rock bottom, I want you to chase girls who spend all their weekends in nightclubs. Finally, 26 to 30 years old, society, especially women, expect you to have a high net worth. So to hit rock bottom, spend all your money and put yourself in as much debt as possible. By doing the exact opposite of what society expects of you, most people will look down on you and that will make you lonely and unprepared for life. But to truly ruin your life as quick as possible, you also need to destroy what makes most men your age successful and worst of all, make enemies with half the population. This takes us to number two, follow this daily routine to quickly ruin your lives. You see, the average man today lives better than most kings did back in the day. Yet, most men today are unhappy. And the reason is that modern conveniences make your life too easy. So if you want to ruin your life in the quickest and easiest way possible, I want you to follow this daily routine. Wake up and have your breakfast delivered by Uber Eats. Then swipe on a few girls online using Tinder. Then spend a few hours online shopping, have whatever you need delivered within the next 24 hours through Amazon and do all of this without talking to any real people. Then I want you to spend the rest of your day watching university lectures or working from home. Then order your lunch and dinner using Uber Eats as well. And then finally, talk to your friends online on Discord or in your video game lobby. Gorgeously and repeat the routine. That, if this sounds familiar, at this point, you can turn back and fix your life as quick as possible. Even for those of you that feel that it's too late, you've already ruined your life. But it's not just about changing your habits. You need to surround yourself with high quality men that also want a better their lives. That will hold you accountable and motivate you as you hold them accountable and motivate them. Up until now, those men don't exist. I do this to you through the camera. This is my passion to motivate you in uplifting. But what if we change that? Too many men don't have a community they can rely on. So I am now on a mission to create the world's best immense community online, which I'm calling the Institute. Or I will be in there as a brotherhood and uplifting you so we all can become better men together. Now, this is not a course. I'm not interested in courses. What I'm interested in is real life experiences, something that's tangible that you can learn that you can grow from, opportunities that you can seize to help you succeed in life to prove it to you. You can sign up now for a one-way trial for just a dollar. After that, it's 50 bucks a month. And then every month, I would choose 10 of you guys from the Institute, from around the world, from everywhere around the world. And we're going to travel somewhere around the world together. We'll go to New York to learn networking. We'll go to parents to learn fashion. We'll go to Shanghai and learn how to start your own clothing company. We're going to experience the world together and then inside the community uplift each other, learn from each other, and actually create a brotherhood you can rely on to grow. This is going to be the best thing I've ever done in my life. And for you, the best decision you can ever do is signing up now. Number three, help others get rich while you stay poor. The average man spends around one third of his life helping others get rich while they live paycheck to paycheck. And according to science, when you are about to die, there is only one thing that ends up being your biggest regret. You see, in a recent study that focused on a thousand elderly people, they found what the top four regrets were once they were on their deathbed. In an order of popularity, the first one, 58% said not negotiating for a salary or a new job. 58% said staying at a job too long. 59% said not prioritizing work-life balance. And 60% said not asking for a pay increase. If you want to ruin your life, make somebody else rich while you stay poor and never ask for more. Number four, make an enemy of half the population. If you want to ruin your life, you need to destroy a chance of ever having success with women. So here's a three-step formula that most men already do to destroy any sort of attraction a woman could have for you. Step one, stop showering or brushing your teeth and then let all the hair on your face or head just grow out wildly. Step two, join incel and red pill communities on Discord and Reddit and start blaming the fact that women aren't interested in you and the fact that all women only create only fans or are low quality women. And finally, step three, replace physical interactions with digital pleasure. From this point on, forget about all the wants of you ever wanting to find a girlfriend or a wife and replace all your needs with pornography. All right, so so far, you've ruined your life by ignoring society and any state of success they want. They use modern conveniences to make your life super easy. You're helping others get rich while you stay poor. And finally, you've now made enemies with any woman you ever come across with. And in the process, you are now ruining your life quicker than you ever thought was possible. But there are three more steps remaining if you're truly committed into hitting rock bottom. And I just hope that if you guys are watching this right now, none of you hit step seven, but there's no turning back after that. Go on to number five, use escapism to forget about what you need to succeed. According to a recent study, 57% of young men want to become famous on social media. However, almost all of them do exactly the opposite of what's necessary to achieve that goal. And in the process, they destroy their lives. So here's how you can do the same. I want you to wake up and start your day by just doom scrolling until that very last minute before you have to go to school or work. Then during breaks or when you're bored at school or work, I want you to doom scroll some more. And finally, when you get home and you get in bed as you're tired, don't scroll some more until you fall asleep. Then rise up and repeat the process every single day until you forget about what you actually need to do to become a content creator. You see, for those of you who do have goals, however, you need to understand that your need or urge to just doom scroll on social media is a form of escapism. This means that you're trying to avoid something in your life. This is why a good brotherhood, a community of men around you is so important. Because if you had guys around you that won't stand for that, that'll tell you, yo, stop doom scrolling, let's go shoot content together, or let's go work on the business together, or let's go study, your life would be completely different. As a matter of fact, most men don't have those friends around them. This is what's motivating me to create the best online men's community there is, where you know what you have to do. You don't need another dumb course. You don't need somebody else telling you to quit their nine to five or to not go to college. What you need is highly motivated men that have your mindset of wanting to be great, of wanting to build something amazing with their life, whether that's their career in college or in business. So together, we can motivate ourselves towards our goals, because deep down, we all know what we need to do. And for me, it was create the Institute, create this brotherhood, create the best men's online community, and then be part of that community with you guys. So you don't only motivate me, but I'm motivating you guys. And I'm taking 10 of you every single month around the world to learn, to experience culture, to become and grow. And now that you have all this wisdom, you can help more guys within the community. And to think, you can sign up now for a dollar, seven week trial, get in there now. I am committed in making this the best community ever, and I need you to help me in this mission. I'm tired of hearing about lonely men. The Institute drops August 14th, where you can get early access today for a dollar. Number six, burn as many bridges as possible. Is he success? It's about who you know. What you know. Therefore, to ruin your life as fast as possible, burn every bridge you have. And here's a simple list of how to do that. Quit your job without notice, that way you can burn the bridges with your managers. Then consistently bail on plans with your friends. Last minute. Then submit assignments or work late to annoy your professors or your boss. Then refuse to apologize, even when you're wrong. I want you to borrow money from friends, never pay them back. Ignore messages and calls from anyone trying to reach you. Then I want you to arrive late to work without offering an excuse. And finally, pressure your friends to do more drugs and alcohol. If you use all these techniques, you'll find yourself alone in one step away from hitting rock bottom. This leads me to the final step, which honestly, none of you should even watch this. Unless you wanna take that final risk and ruin your life forever. Number seven, replace fulfilling habits with pleasure-filled habits. If you wanna completely ruin your life and hit rock bottom, you'll need to replace fulfilling habits with pleasure habits. Most men will chase happiness without realizing that it is a byproduct of pleasure and fulfillment. However, pleasure-based happiness is short-term, while fulfilling-based happiness is long-term. So, here's the simplest of habits I want you to replace. Replace trying to get rich in real life with getting rich in a video game. Replace reading educational books with low-quality TV series. Replace cooking nutritious meals with ordering takeout. Replace meditation with smoking weed. Replace journaling with drinking alcohol. And replace exercising with taking antidepressants. If you replace all of these fulfilling habits with the pleasurable ones I just gave you, you will completely destroy your chances of long-term success and forever be chasing short-term happiness, a process that will put you right at the bottom of the social ladder and keep you there forever. Now, if you find yourself in this final stage, I'm telling you right now, all the advice in the world, while it will help you, it will be extremely difficult to do alone. Make it your mission and let's build the strongest men's community online of high-quality men that are trying to better themselves. You guys want to take action? Before we open August 15th, you can reserve your spot now with just a dollar. See you boys inside."

        "transcript": " What is the best way to overcome your court addiction and then cure your brain from all the negative effects it's had on you? Nofap. So today, I'm gonna show you what your first 100 days of nofap will look like while giving you tips to make it 10 times easier. But before you even begin this journey, you need to rewire your brain. You need to understand that these nofap streaks don't work the way that you think. Most men believe that it's all about the number of days that you last in one single relapse means that you have to start all over again. But this isn't true because your brain adapts to new behavior. So even if you relapse after a certain number of days, you've still weakened the pathway in your brain that would urge you towards fapping. Therefore, to do this correctly, you're not just gonna track the streak of days of nofap. I want you to track the percentage of days that you stay clean. For example, if you do one month of nofap and then you relapse one day, but then you go back to a whole month of nofap, that means you're at a 98% clean rate. And this is just as impressive as a 60 day streak. So let's go to the first 24 hours of nofap. Today is the day you decide to stop. You're going to use activation energy to not get horny. This day one's actually gonna be pretty easy because you're gonna be filled with motivation and energy that scientists call activation energy. This is when your brain is flooded with dopamine due to the anticipated rewards from this new challenge. However, relapses can still have. So I want you to implement these four strategies today to make sure you stay clean till tomorrow. First, start your nofap journey on a Monday when you're going back to school or to work. Second, meet up with friends or family right after school or work. Third, I want you to finish your day within an intense workout. And fourth, I want you to stay away from all homes of social media, especially Twitter and Reddit. These surface level strategies are just to help you keep busy and distracted day one. Reducing the chances of failing the challenge on the first day. However, these tricks, they're not gonna do anything for you. As the days progress into your challenge into what I call the danger zone. You can't get past days two and three of nofap. This is where most relapses. This is because you're using surface level techniques to try to stop, but this only addresses the symptoms and not the root cause as to why you fast. So I'm gonna show you the surface level techniques which are helpful, but then I'm gonna show you how to address the root cause. So most of the surface level techniques are the ones that you use to keep busy, which we kind of went over. But you also have porn blockers that you can put on your phone or computer. You can watch motivational videos or you can just try to rely on sheer willpower. The problem is that these techniques will help you fight your urge, but willpower is limited. And it's gonna get to a point that when you just use willpower, you're gonna end up relapsing between day two and three. So instead of using willpower to fight your urges, I want you to track on a notepad every time you feel the urge to fast. I want you to know where you are, what time of the day it is, what you're doing and what you can do to avoid it. Now, after writing a few of these notes, you can try and then find a common trigger. For most people, this will be your environment. This will be boredom, lack of sex, stress or an inability to cope with emotion. Now, even if you do relapse in days two or three, you have at least learned what trigger you need to avoid that's the root cause that urges you to fast. But now we move on to days four through seven to complete your first week of nofap. We're gonna go over the negative side effect. It is through days four and seven of nofap that you're gonna start to realize all the long-term negative effect of all the fapping and corn addiction you've had for years. Now, these negative side effects depend on two things. It depends on how long you've been watching corn and fapping and how you handle these negative side effects. From least to most concerning, the side effects of heavy fapping and corn use are a decent sedation to real life women. Next, a decreased satisfaction being next to real life women. And finally, the worst one of them all, an inability to get an erection. If you're just experiencing minor to moderate symptoms, look, the more you can stay off port, the quicker you can fix these negative side effects. However, the worst side effect, which is just having an inability to get erection, this one, you need a quick method to fix it. And what I recommended last time, I've been using the game changer called the penis pump. I had a fan that had an inability to get an erection. Bro, you feel like you got a micro on you? Yeah. How does that feel? Like the run-in winner. You also suffered from confidentiality because of his package size. What happens when you're with a girl? Like, do you have issues there? A little bit, just like a ticket banter of the experience. So I had and tried a bathmate penis pump. Now, this is an actual medical device. This is not a toy. As a matter of fact, it is the only SNA regulated device for your personal area. Here's the added bonus. His private parts increased inside. What type of performance improvements that you see, size-wise? Size-wise, a bit of what, a lot of girth. A lot of girth? Yeah. That's what I always hear. Now, did that girth boost your confidence? Yes, definitely. I couldn't believe this. Even though I read all the reviews, I read all the forums, I saw all the studies, I had to get him to pick this myself. Look, your boy had no problem with erection. Your boy did iron rod, but I think every man wants extra size. So I had to check this out myself, bro. He wasn't kidding. I've been using this for the past few weeks. When you use it, essentially what the pump is doing, it's drawing blood into that region. I'm not even exaggerating here. I wanna say I put about an extra half inch to inch in size down there. I am amazed, but what I'm more amazed about is just how healthy the guy is. Bro, I am getting the strongest and hardest erections I've ever had in my life. This thing is incredible. It's all natural. It has no side effect and it's easy to use. Look, if you're anything like me and a little bit cautious, go read the reviews. Insane. Everybody said it gets bigger, it gets harder. I have to try it myself. I think you're gonna have to try yourself as well. If you wanna get stronger erections, if you wanna even increase size down there, I want you guys to check out Bathmate. This thing is incredible. I'm gonna have it linked down below. I'm also gonna include the discount. This is the best pump in the market. You won't find a better one in the discount. It's gonna make it more affordable for you. If you guys wanna check it out, they'll be linked down below. Now let's move on to day seven to 30 of your NOFAP. I call this the flat lie. When you do NOFAP long enough, a scary thing might happen that might cause you to relapse if you don't know about it. The first seven days, they're filled with intense urges and temptation, but the next three weeks are often marked by what experts call the flat lie. And I'm telling you right now, I got freaked out when this happened to me the first time because you go from having all the urges, you're like the sexual machine, to all of a sudden having no urges at all. It's like you become asexual. It's like you're not interested in it anymore. It almost gets to a point that it feels like your libido disappears. Like you're even stopped waking up with morning wood. I'm telling you this because many men will use this as an excuse to relapse to see if it's still good. Do not fall for that trap. You are just cleansing yourself. Instead, you need to recognize that this is a good sign that your mind is healing from all that over sexual stimulation. You've been feeding it for years. Now, if after the 30 day mark, you notice, yo, I can't get an erection or you're actually intimate with a girl during that time, you're kissing her and nothing's happening down there, this is a more serious sign. And even then, don't even be freaked out. The bath made penis pump, I just recommended it might be the end. I know my boys that listen and already are gonna go try this out, think to add size. If you have this in your cabinet and you are ever in that position, use this thing. I'm telling you, it's amazing as to what it can do for your erections on top of adding extra size. Like who doesn't want that? But the one thing you don't wanna do is go back to pornography. Now, we're moving on to day 30 to 100. What we call the sweet spot. From day 30 onward, the benefits of nofap, they just keep coming. Keep it simple, here's a quick rundown of all the benefits you'll expect once you reach this mark. By day 30, you're gonna notice an increase of interest from women around you by day 40. You're gonna see a significant boost in strength in the gym or when you're playing sports. By day 50, you're gonna start feeling extremely confident because of all these changes. By day 60, your libido and sex drive will be so high that any anxiety you had about talking to girls will disappear because you're gonna need to conquer real life with. By day 80, your emotional resilience will be impenetrable. By day 90, your mental clarity will be superior. And by day 100, all urges to relapse will have fully subsided. The thought of fappy will disgust you. The thought of just opening a porn act will be so disgusting to you that you will have all the willpower necessary to not relapse again. Now that you understand your journey, right day one, you're gonna have activation energy. That motivation can actually do it. Day two to three, we're gonna apply strategies to understand the root triggers. Days four to seven, you're gonna see all the long-term negative side effects on your body from all the damage you had done to it. Day seven to 30, you'll experience that libido flat lie. And then from day 30 to 40, you'll get full clarity and freedom from fappy. But now you are ready for the final and most important stage, day 100 and beyond, what I call the lifestyle change. Because at this point, you're gonna start experiencing three benefits of no fape that are rarely talked about. The first benefit is a complete shift in how you view women. Instead of seeing them as intimidating objects or just objects for sex, you're gonna start seeing them as real people. And this change in perception, make you more attractive. The second benefit you'll notice is that you won't need to constantly be working on your confidence. You're just gonna naturally become confident. It's gonna be like an afterthought. It's gonna naturally feel that void that you felt you almost always had. Because you achieved something that 99% of men can't and that transforms you. And the third benefit is that little things in life become more meaningful. Without the need to seek validation or being shy, you're gonna live more authentically and you can focus on what truly matters, which is your friends, your family, your hobbies and improving yourself. And now you have everything you need to fully start no fat, cut your pornography addiction and understand what you're gonna go through for the next 100 days. And remember, if you need to boost your man's sexual health down there, I always recommend bathmate. I've been using that penis pump and I'm telling you, that thing will literally change how big your guy is. If you guys wanna check out Bathmate, it'll be linked down below. See you guys next time."

        "transcript": " The average man will lose his virginity between the ages of 15 and 17. And this is what leads men that haven't lost their virginity by that age, almost feeling inadequate. Like you're not good enough. But this is where I want you to change your mind. Because the average man is also in debt, overweight, and addicted to pornography. Following the average or the majority usually leads to failure. I'm going to take you on a two-part journey today and show you why not having sex yet is actually a good thing. And then how to go about doing it with the right person at the right time. Let's start with part number one. Why not losing your virginity is actually a good thing. To start, I want to explain to you three reasons why not losing your virginity is actually a good thing and why putting it off might put you ahead of all of your other friends. Number one, you're actually more happy now that you're a virgin. You see, most women believe that the more women they have sex with, the happier they're going to be. But according to the science I'm about to show you, the exact opposite is true. You see, according to research, for every woman a man sleeps with, his chances of having a happy, healthy relationship diminishes. For example, if a man has only had one sexual partner, his chances of happiness and success in a marriage are up to 71%. With two partners, it goes down to 65%. With three partners, it goes down to 64%. With four partners, it goes down to 63%. With five partners, it goes down to 60%. With six to ten partners, it's 62%. With 11 to 20 partners, it goes back down to 58%. And for men who have had sex with 21 partners or more, it stays around that 59%. Now, the important question that you should be asking right now is, why are men so committed to sleeping with so many women when it doesn't actually lead to happiness? The answer to that question is friends. As a young man, you feel pressure to sleep with more girls because your friends are either directly or indirectly pressuring you by making it the focus on every conversation you've had. This means that virginity is in the issue. The community around you is the problem. What you need is a change of community when the focus isn't just sleeping with women, but bettering yourself. And that is exactly what I have been working on for the last 12 months. If you're one of those guys where chasing women is not your number one priority, and instead it's building real world skills, traveling, and bonding with a brotherhood of men so you can continue to better yourself. I want you to come and bond with me. Boys, the Institute is dropping September 15th, we're less than two weeks away. We are on a mission to get rid of the male loneliness epidemic because that is what's stopping you. Not the women. It's not the girl that you can't get. It's that you're not focusing on yourself, on your experiences, and building friendships and memories that are going to last a lifetime. That is what's fulfilling. And that's why there's already thousands of guys that have reserved their spot, but it's not too late because we're dropping September 15th this Institute. Whatever slots are left, they're going to sell out fast. But for those of you that want to take action, for those of you, they're not going to wait last minute and try to get your spot. You know you want to be part of this mission and change how men level up. You can reserve your spot today for just a dollar before we launch September 15th. And inside, you're going to be part of a brotherhood of guys that are just like you, that are just like me, that are hungry to grow, hungry to experience life because that's what truly matters. How many women you sleep with? That is a waste of time. What you want are stories to tell your children. What you want is personal growth. What you want is to learn how to build that business, how to make friends that last a lifetime, how to live a life of purpose. And all of that is what you will find inside the Institute. I'm going to be in there looking out for you as a brother, as will every other guy. And every month, we'll choose between 10 and 20 lucky guys. And each guy will represent a different part of the country. And I'm going to pay for all expenses as we travel different parts of the world to learn, to grow, and have the greatest experiences. Because this is how you're supposed to learn as a man, from life experiences, not in the classroom, and not from courses that don't work. Boys, you can reserve your spot for a dollar for a seven day trial. After that, you'll be 50 bucks a month. That is the best investment you'll ever make in your life. Plus, join yourself to a mission that will change how men level up. See you boys inside. Number two, having sex under 20 years old will make you poor and ugly. Most men will dedicate their lives to having sex with as many women as possible. What they don't realize is that every girl they have sex with puts them one step closer into ruining their lives. And again, this is not just my experience of what I've lived. This is also backed by science. On a study conducted on high school students, researchers wanted to know how the age teens had sex with affected their mental well-being. They started by asking 6,086 students who were thought to be sexually active to fill out a questionnaire. What the study showed is that those teens who started having sexual acts at younger ages faced more negative outcomes later in life than those that weren't sexually active. For example, teens who had sex very young were more likely to sexually assault someone else, be sexually assaulted, engage in pain for sex, not go to college, and becoming depressed. Take away here, if you're a teenager who hasn't had sex yet, you're actually on the path of doing better than those around you who have. Now you understand why not losing your virginity young is a good thing. It sets you up for success, but also why you're so urged into losing your virginity. But this is only the beginning because there's one more reason I need you to understand why this is actually a good thing. And then I'm going to show you how to lose your virginity and with who you should lose your virginity. Number three, men who have lower body counts are more attractive. The common narrative is men should have sex with as many women as possible because that makes them attractive. Who has to be more sexually experienced than a relationship with a man or the woman? That's why you need to fuck 50 bitches. See, this narrative, it leads men to believe that higher body counts is what's more attractive to women. He's not the only one saying this every guy says, but during a meta analysis conducted by experts in both cognitive and behavioral neuroscience, researchers found that the number of women a man had slept with had zero correlation with how attractive they were perceived. Instead, they found that what had the most impact on attractiveness was appearing, particularly your own face and body. So this means that the reason that men with high body counts are seen as more attractive is not because they have a high number of body counts is because they're naturally more confident and probably more attractive, which is why girls go to them. Therefore, the best thing you can do is increase the amount of interaction you have with women. So you can have that same natural aura or confidence around women without actually having to sleep with 50 women. And now you understand why you having not lost your virginity is a good thing because now you're prepped to lose it at the right time and the right person, which is what I'm going to make sure you do. This takes us to part number two, how to lose your virginity the right way. First, you need to find the right person. And to do that, you need to use the dating app with the least amount of men. To find a high quality girl, you need to choose the right dating app. However, most men don't realize that their chances of finding a woman vary depending on the app they choose to use. So I'm going to break down the three most popular dating apps and show you how to use the best one to find yourself a high quality partner. Now, the worst of the three dating apps is Tinder because research has shown 80% of the users are men. Bumble is the next best option, but data shows that 67% of the user base is men. This means that the best dating app for meeting a woman is Hinge, as it has a user base that's only 60% male, but your work isn't done yet. Now that you've chosen the right app, you need to make sure you can find a high quality woman on this app. And to do this, you need to always look at their profiles for these five red flags. Does she talk about drinking in her bio? Does she have pictures of herself in bikini? Does she have any visible piercings on her face? Does she have photos that only show her face? Or does she have photos that are heavily edited? Now, by just looking at these red flags and using the right dating app, you've drastically increased your chances of finding a high quality woman. But that is only the first of three ways that I'm about to show you on how to find a good partner. This takes me to number two. Avoid women that sleep in past 10 in the morning. Most low quality women will party all Friday and Saturday night. So if you want to engage with high quality women, you need to engage with women who are productive on Saturday and Sunday mornings. And here are the best places where you can do that. You'll want to start by going to a local beach or park. Now, these places are great because the women there that are in the morning are focused on their own health and haven't been out all night before drinking. And if you want to start a smooth conversation with them, this one works every time. Politely ask them if you can like share a hotspot because you need a message or friend and you're not getting any signal. The approach provides a casual way to start a conversation. And the fact that you're meeting friends shows that you're somebody that's social or likeable. And if she asks you any questions like what you're doing today or what's your name, this is a strong sign that she's also interested and you should proceed by asking for this girl's number. And number three, I need you to use this checklist before you sleep with that girl. Most men will have sex very early on with the first women that says yes to that, which just ends up making them obsessed and wanting more and more chief sex. That's because those guys didn't have an older brother. You got me. And I'm thinking with this, I'm looking out for you. You're thinking with that. So the next time you're in that position before you ask sex with this girl, I want you to have this checklist before you make the decision to sleep with her. First, would this girl remain loyal to you if someone better looking than you hadn't heard number? Second, would this girl get upset with you if you asked for a prenup before marriage? Third, would this girl be a good mother if I decided to have children with her? Fourth, would this girl let me work every day around the weekends? If I was trying to be successful fit, would this girl go party on the weekends with her friends just to try to get my attention or get back at her? Sixth, would this girl start an only fans account if she could make a lot of money? And seventh, would this girl date me if all we did would just go get coffee or a nice walk? If you answered yes to six or more of these questions, you're with a girl that's worthy of being in a long-term and deep relationship with. And that's all I care about. I want a girl for you that won't mess you up, but instead will keep you on your perp. And that's what I'm trying to do in the Institute for your boys joy. I'm going to be looking out for you guys and so will be every other man inside that brotherhood because that is what you need. You need good men around you. That's why I want to see you inside where you can reserve your spot at just one dollar."

        "transcript": " This is the most important video you're gonna watch today if you're young. You see your hobbies, they make you more attractive, they give you purpose. This is why I'm going to show you nine of the best hobbies you can start doing this year. Starting with number one, start reading a book a week. The reason you never enjoyed reading is because no one ever taught you how to read a book correctly. You see, most people they'll start in chapter one and read all the way till the end. But if you want a supercharger learning, I want you to start using the three by three method. The next time you pick up a book, first, I need you to stop subvocalizing, which is every time you read the voice in your head. This habit actually slows you down. Second, I want you to start reading phrases instead of words. Your eyes can naturally take in around three words at a time. So I want you to train yourself to start reading in chump. And third, make it a habit. Put the book right by your nightstand and read a few pages right before bed and as soon as you wake up. If you do all three, you'll be crushing through a book a week. And now that you know how to read faster, I want to give you the four books every man should start with. Number one, the way of the superior man. Number two, man's search for meaning. Number three, the 48 laws of power. And number four, rich dad or dad. And now using what I just showed you, I want to test you. We got seven more hobbies to go. It's go to number two, start lifting weights to get newbie gains. Look, if you're an absolute newbie in the gym, here's what your weekly lifting schedule should look like. There you go. See, most people think, oh, I have to go to the gym six, seven times a day. No, you don't. This guy recommends four and that's exactly what it should be for you. Now let's see what your week should look like. I love that. See, this is exactly what I do. Legs and cardio on Monday. It's tough and most people skip legs, including myself, which is why I forced myself to do it at the beginning of the week. I love that. That's my favorite day. All right, Tuesday, chest, biceps and triceps. These are the muscles that most women will notice and the ones every guy likes to train. Doing it on a Thursday makes sense because Thursday is like a dead day on the week. So it's a good way to feel your body. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday.

So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. So you can do it on a Thursday. See, the mistake most do is that they just download a language app like Duolingo and just start practicing the basics. However, what you're going to realize is that what you're learning, it feels clunky and it doesn't feel natural. So if you want to start learning a new language easily, I want you to do these three steps. First, change the language settings on your phone to the language you're trying to learn to gain more exposure. You already know where everything's at. So now you're going to learn how to read it in a different language. Then, watch your shows and YouTube. For example, this exact video, you're going to click the wheel that's on the corner and select a new language, the language you're trying to learn, and then watch this with English subtitles. And finally, I want you to start listening to music in that native language. This is going to mimic you basically immersing yourself in the culture. It's similar to you traveling and living in that country to learn the language and is scientifically the fastest way to learn a new language easily. Number four, start hiking. You backpacking and hiking is one of the most interesting and masculine hobbies you can practice. But it's only fun if you know what to pack. Three things I no longer bring back packing. A cold school camp chair. It only weighs two pounds. If you ever hike, look, I did a 30 mile ultra marathon through the mountains and I just had a camel pack. It was a pack of water. It felt incredibly heavy on my back because every step you take, especially on incline, it's way more difficult. So every pound makes a difference. Rubble toothpaste. I switched to tablets. They can't melt or freeze. That's genius. Yo, you want to know what's funny? I carry those tablets to travel with because of the same reason. I actually like them better because they're lighter and they're easier to pack than TSA never throws it out. But honestly, like you just said, this makes a great hiking gear. And lastly, band aids. Instead, I use lucho tape. It stays on for multiple days and can get wet. It's so good. You would be such a G out in the woods with all the right gear. Imagine if it's like a first date with a girl and you have everything packed correctly like this girl is telling you. Hiking is going to be your new favorite hobby. And look, I'm no expert. I just enjoy being outdoor. And truthfully, I just push myself to do new things. Being in the woods and hiking and going up mountains really just became huge for me, especially because I have this subscription to a company called Bespoke Post. They have a monthly membership club, delivering a box of awesome top shelf goods from under the radar brand. It's free to join and you can skip a month or cancel any time. For example, this month, I got the tarot box, which includes a field knife, a charcoal bar of soap so I can shower in the woods like my ancestors did and even a bird calling whistle. Do you understand how excited I am about this hobby? This is what makes life exciting. And the more interesting you become, the more girls and just people in general want to hang around you. And a cool thing I like about Bespoke Post is that many percent of the products come from small businesses, many of which are based in the US. It's unique, high quality stuff that you can't get anywhere else. If you're a masculine dude that just likes cool gear, like just dope products, you have to check out Bespoke Post, bro. I've been subscribed for a while and every month, it's like Christmas. If you guys want to check it out, get 20% off your first monthly shipment, click the link in the description and enter TMF20 at checkout or go to bespokepost.com slash TMF20. Number five, learn how to fight. You will eventually find yourself in a situation where you might need to defend yourself or at least have the confidence to know you can defend yourself. So here are the martial arts you should learn to cover your basis. First, it's Brazilian Jujitsu. This is excellent for one-on-one combat and works great when you're off close and personal with people. I practice this myself and I can attest just how effective this is against somebody that isn't trained. That's why a lot of these videos, you'll see me with like a black eye, my fingers are bruised, I'm always bruised up. However, it is that constant training and beating that your body takes that makes you so confident in your abilities. However, this usually can only work against one opponent. If it's multiple opponent, I would recommend a second martial arts. One that can help you keep distance. And for that, it would either be kickboxing or Muay Thai. Just because you're using all your limbs here and it's ideal to keep all your opponents as far as possible just so you can escape. And lastly, if your attackers have a weapon, run. I mean, there are certain martial arts like Judo, but I wouldn't take my chance. You see, by learning these, you're not only going to be prepared for multiple situations, but I promise you the confidence you'll feel, you'll never get bullied or intimidated by any man in your life. Now think about these hobbies I've just showed you. You're reading a book a week, which is making you smarter. You're lifting weights and getting crazy gains. You're learning a new language. You're mastering the outdoors and you're learning how to fight. You're becoming an all-around interesting guy and everything I've shown you is free. And this is why I also recommend Be Spokepost in the subscription box I described, because every month you get something different that forces you to learn a new skill or new hobby. Bro, one month I even got a Brood Your Own Kombucha set. You know how much fun I had with my girl trying to brew my own kombucha at home? Do you know how much game I'm giving you with this secret? Think about it, your girl comes over to your crib, you're like, yo, yo, I got this new subscription box and it's a random activity. You want to do it with me? She's going to be excited just of like the unknown. I'm telling you, if you really want to level it up, check out Be Spokepost. It's going to be linked down below. But we have a few more hobbies that will make you insanely attractive. Stasis to number six, learn daily meditation practice. Look, I've meditated a thousand days in a row now and it's changed my life in the most unexpected way possible. And here's how you can start meditating yourself. First, find a quiet place. The mistake most people do is that they tell you, clear your mind. This is not possible. Instead, you should focus your mind on one thing. So close your eyes and now imagine a laser scanning your body starting from your head all the way down to your toes. Your mind will start wandering to other thoughts. Now when that happens, I don't want you to get mad at yourself. Instead, label the thought, push it out of your mind and tell yourself you'll deal with that later. Once you've scanned your entire body, I want you to start counting your breaths. Count up to 10, then start over once you reach it. Finally, after a few minutes of counting, let go of the counting and just sink into that relaxed state of mind. Let your mind just wander and enjoy the moment. Then get up and continue your day and you'll notice how much more focus you'll have throughout it. This does make you feel more present and relaxed. However, that's not the reason that I meditate. I meditate so that when I'm with a friend or I'm with my wife, I can focus entirely on what they're saying and nothing else. If something begins to distract me like a message or a thought, I'll label it, I'll set it aside, and I'll think to myself, I'll deal with that later. When you're truly master meditation and being present, it's not only you that's going to notice a difference. Everyone around you will feel your present. Number seven, learn to travel. Look, traveling is expensive, but it's something every man should do at least once in his life. But the best news is that you don't have to spend a lot of money to travel. As a matter of fact, here's three cheap ways to do it. Look, to travel on the lowest level, explore different parts of your city. Go to free museums. Now, for a bit more on expense, you can just do a road trip to a different side of your country and explore different landmarks. If you want an incredible experience that's going to evolve your mind, I want you to go to a different culture completely. This is the most expensive level of traveling, but I'm solving that as well. This alone will change you as a man. You will learn, you will evolve. It's the best way to learn. And that's why with our new community, which I'm calling the Institute, our Brotherhood, and when you're subscribed to our community, every month I will choose 10 guys randomly and pay for everything. Flights, travel, and go into the most incredible parts of the world, Dubai, Singapore, New York, and learn from those cultures, learn business, learn how to network, create amazing experiences with you guys. It is going to be the world's greatest community. And the reason I'm doing it is because I feel men need to unlock this level. Now, there will be more on that launch, probably going to be close to end of August. So be on the lookout for it. Number eight, learn to journal. Look, I've been journaling for almost five years. If I were to start over now, here are the things I would have wanted to know then. First, you need to create a habit where you can find a place where you can do it every day at the same time. For me, it's right on my kitchen counter every morning before I head out. Second, don't try to fill an entire page or multiple pages. Instead, try to just write for a minute and do that for the next 10 days. Then do two minutes for the next 10 days and gradually increase one minute every 10 days till you're writing for at least 10 minutes a day. And look, if you're stuck on what that first sentence should be, I'm going to give you a template of six sentences right here. Literally, you could just fill in the blank. The point is just to get your mind to start working and start writing for the day. Third, do not overcomplicate it. Look, the writing will be messed up. You're going to make mistakes. It shouldn't be grammatically correct. You might even regret writing some things. But that is the whole point of journaling. To reduce stress, increase emotional intelligence, which overall will just make you more interesting to everyone around. And finally, number nine, learn to invest. If you have $100, here's exactly what you should do next. First, put $40 into the S&P 500 index. The S&P follows the 500 largest companies in America. And according to the richest investor in the world, Warren Buffett, it is the best place to start growing your money every single year. My view for most people, this thing to do is to only S&P 500 index. Next, invest $30 into Schwab's dividend track. This fund includes some of the best dividend paying companies in the world, meaning these companies will pay you just for owning their stock. And finally, put the remaining $30 into stocks of brands that you enjoy. So if you have an iPhone, invest an Apple, if you have a PlayStation, invest in Sony, if you use X-Fox, invest in Microsoft. I want you to practice the habit of doing this every time you have an extra $100 to spare. Just watch how your money will start multiplying. And no, this isn't financial advice, but it's what I do. If you start doing the nine hobbies I just showed you in this video, bro, you're gonna be irresistible."

        "transcript": " A lot of guys look ugly purely because of their bad skin. But today, I'm going to show you how to easily fix 10 of the most common skin issues that's destroying your attractiveness. Start with number one. I want you to use these tips to stop excessive sweating. If you sweat too much, especially under stress, you probably have a condition called hyperhydrosis, which basically means your sweat glands are just overreactive. Hyperhydrosis is most common in areas like your armpit, your hands, and your forehead. But here's a three-step process on how to stop that sweating forever. First, instead of using regular deodorants that only make you smell nice, look for anti-perspirants at your local pharmacy. Anti-perspirants contain active ingredients that physically block your sweat glands. Second, you want to apply the anti-perspirant before bed. This allows it to work more effectively by forming a barrier around your skin. And third, avoid any food or drinks that increase your cortisol levels, such as caffeine, chocolate, or spicy food. All of these will increase stress, which will make you sweat more. So by just switching the deodorant you use and the food that you consume, we're stopping one of the worst skin issues possible, which is excessive sweating. You're already looking better. There's nine more skin problems I need to fix for you. She takes me to number two. You're going to make your large pores disappear with this one ingredient. If you have large pores in your face and you don't know how to get rid of them, this tips for you. If you've tried every product under the sun and you've never had success, it's because it didn't contain one ingredient, salicylic acid. This is a scientifically proven ingredient to shrink large pores. Now, you can't just buy the acid on its own, but what I like to do is combine salicylic acid with everyday products that I already use, like a face wash. So for example, my everyday face wash, the wash that I use every day, contains salicylic acid and it's from geology. And that way, I don't even have to think about it. I know every time that I wash my face, I'm using the right amount of salicylic acid that's going to keep my skin looking tight. So to use it properly though, I want you to start by using lukewarm water on your face. This is going to open up the pores, then place a pea sized amount of the product on your fingers and start rubbing it in. This is going to get the salicylic acid to work inside the pores. While applying, you want to make sure you're going in a circular motion and upwards against gravity. Remember, your skin's being pulled down by gravity all day long. So to fight against that, I want you to push upwards as you wash your face. Doing this will tighten your pores and make your skin look better. Number three, there are three ingredients to deal with your whiteheads. These three ingredients I'm about to show you are proven to help eliminate whiteheads forever. First is benzyl peroxide. This ingredient is highly effective because it absorbs into the skin and dissolves all the gulk inside your pores that ends up turning into a whitehead. The second ingredient is salicylic acid. At this point, if you don't have salicylic acid, after I've told you you need it, you're doing this to your skin, bro. You're doing this to yourself. You see, salicylic acid is also great for whiteheads because remember, this is good for guys with oily skin as it penetrates deep into your pores and gets rid of any dirt inside them there. What I found in Sa\u00efd's Direct found that a two percent concentration is more than enough for your skin. This is why I don't have a lot of whiteheads. I rarely deal with this problem whereas before, I used to have tons of tiny bumps on my forehead. So to make sure you're using this, make sure you have it in your face wash. So if you have a face wash that already has salicylic acid, this is something you don't have to worry about. And geology makes the best face wash in the market. As a matter of fact, that's not just me telling you that. Geology has won countless of awards from major publications like Men's Journal and Men's Health placing them as some of the best skin care products for men. The team has formulated what I consider the perfect lineup of skin care products for guys and if you have trouble in finding good products, you have to go check out geology. The third are retinol. This regulates the turnover of your dead skin cells which helps prevent those dead skin cells from then clogging up your pores. Again, if you don't have good retinol, geology offers a good night cream which I love to use so every night the night cream contains retinol. I like to apply it and then as I sleep, my skin's being repaired basically. You're starting using these three ingredients, you'll get rid of your whiteheads forever. Number four, use this tool to remove all your blackheads. You see, when you have a blackhead, you'll do one of two approaches. You either pick at it or you ignore it. Both of these approaches are wrong. What you need to do is use a combedone extractor which can easily be found on Amazon. They're actually affordable. To use it, you just gently squeeze your blackheads between the extractor and the tissue paper. Then the combedones vibrations make it easy to pop out the blackhead without causing any scarring on your skin or spreading any extra bacteria. Number five, follow these two rules to get rid of your rosacea. Rosacea is a super common condition that most people don't even know they have. It typically appears as harsh redness on the forehead, nose, or chin area. And sometimes it comes with like acne-like bumps. Now, when it comes to treating rosacea, you need to focus on two things. First, you need to avoid the primary triggers of rosacea, which include heat, stress, intense exercise, alcohol, spicy foods, and hot, caffeinated beverages. Second, you need to use products specifically designed for sensitive skin. This means opting for a gentle cleanser or a mild moisturize. And this is one of the reasons why I love geology. See, with geology, you get products for your skin problem because all of the problems are different. And the reason why you can't get clear skin is that you keep using the same cookie cutter products that somebody else recommends. With geology, you can click the link down below and take their skin test and see what are your problems, where then they can give you the products that you need for your specific issue. Whether you have sensitive skin or oily skin or acne prone, whatever your problem is, geology has recovered and they don't stop there. They also have a 70% discount to make sure that your first month's box is as affordable as possible. And that's all it takes. Once you use geology for 30 days, you're going to see an immense difference on your skin. I promise you, you're going to be hooked. If you guys want to check out geology and get that 70% discount, I suggest you click the link down below. Take their quiz, see what products they recommend for you and then get them at an absolute steal. You guys want to check it out? The link will be down below. Number six, stop making these mistakes to prevent your ingrown hairs. If you're constantly getting ingrown hairs, it's usually because you're using the wrong razor and techniques. First, only use razors with one or two blades. Any more razors can usually cause irritation. Second, always shave in the direction of hair growth, not against it. Third, use as few strokes as possible to minimize irritation on the skin. Fourth, exfoliate your skin before and after shaving and finish by applying a cold wet cloth to the shaved area to reduce irritation. Now by this point, we've reduced your sweaty, your whiteheads, your large pores, your rosacea and even your ingrown hairs. But we can't stop there because we still need to figure out how to get rid of your wrinkles, your oily skin and your acne. So let's move on to number seven. Use these steps to prevent wrinkles. Small lines and then lines under your eyes are the first signs of aging that can damage your appearance. So, here's how you're going to prevent them. I want you to start applying a moisturizer that has sunscreen or SPF every day, not just on sunny days, but even on shady days or days that it's rainy. If you're using geology, I recommend the performance sunscreen that they have because they have just a sunscreen or you can use your daily moisturizer that has a built-in SPF. Second, you need to use a retinol product every night. I mentioned I use a night cream from geology that has retinol because as you sleep, retinol repairs your skin, helping fill in some of those fine irons. Eight, use this hack to get rid of oily skin. You do not need fancy products to get rid of oily skin. Here's a trick that I use, whether you're at home or you're out with friends or you're on a date. I want you to grab a tissue or a piece of toilet paper and lightly dab your T-zone area, which is the middle of your nose and your entire forehead, as this is the most problematic area that produces the most oil. And that's it. Your face will now look clear. Number nine, treat dry skin with slugging. If you have dry and flaky skin, you need to start slugging. Now the best product for slugging is Vaseline. I've been using this since I was a teenager and I haven't found anything more effective. And it even has dermatologist's recommendation for hydrating skin, searing in the washer and making your skin glow. So here's how you slug with Vaseline. First you're going to clean your face as you normally would. Then put a pea size of the mount on the tip of your finger and then apply it very lightly to the entire surface of your face. A small amount goes a long way, but you can use more if necessary. Immediately after, you're going to notice your skin is going to be glowing and the dryness will disappear. Number ten, use this supplement to get rid of cold sores. Cold sores are a form of oral horpies, so don't freak out about 50 to 90 percent of you probably have had it. To prevent them, you want to apply SPF to your lips anytime you're going out to the sun. You can use regular sunscreen or you can just buy a lip balm that has SPF, that inhibits the absorption of arginine, which is an amino acid that's essential for the herpes virus to replicate. And the best supplement for this is licey. You're going to want to take between a thousand and two thousand milligrams a day until the cold sores disappear. But trust me on this. It's going to disappear three times as fast if you take this supplement. And now you have everything you need to clear your skin from all major conditions so you can look more attractive."

        "transcript": " The unhappiest men I've ever met in my life share the same traits. They are incredibly ambitious, equally lazy. They crave the outcome, but they despise the work. They love results, but they hate the journey. They have potential for greatness, but the voices in their head are keeping them lazy. So in today's video, I'm going to show you 10 habits to get you out of that lazy era. Starting with voice number one. Oh, I don't know what to do. You see, not knowing what to do, this is what keeps most men lazy. So I'm going to show you how to find something to do in Japanese culture. There is a concept called ikaigi and it's broken down into four circles. What you love and what the world needs. This would be your mission. What you love and what you're good at. This is your passion, what you're good at and what you're paid for. This is your profession and what you're paid for in the world needs. This is your vocation. If you're unsure about what you need to do in your life, I want you to write these four circles down on a piece of paper and then write down the things that fit into each of these circles. Then you need to try to find that one thing that overlaps all four circles. That is your ikaigi. For me, creating content fell into all four circles. I get paid for it. I love what I'm doing. It's what young men need and I'm really good at. You have to remember, this is only one of the 10 voices you're going to hear in your head that's going to keep you lazy. You want to voice number two. Oh, I just can't. If you believe you can't do something, you'll never have the confidence to try. So here are some tips to instantly look and feel more confident when you're working from home. Instead of staying in your pajamas or sweats all day, dress up nicely. Instead of slouching on your desk, I want you to sit up straight with your chest lifted and your shoulders rolled back. Instead of sitting in a cluttered room, I want you to tidy it up and put everything in its place. And then instead of sitting in a stuffy home, I want you to open some windows so you can breathe some fresh air. Voice number three. I'm afraid I'll fail and look stupid. You see, a lot of people will tell you, oh, you shouldn't care about what people think, but nobody really shows you how to do it. So here's how to truly stop caring about what people think every single day using three steps. First, you need to understand that you have no control about what others think or do in their lives. Second, you need to realize that those who fear judgment are usually the ones that judge people the most. So as soon as you stop judging others, you'll start to care less about being judged in return. And third, if someone talks about you or judges you, remember, it is a reflection of the own insecurities, not yours. Let them waste their time on others while you focus on self-improvement. Voice number four. Oh, I'm just a lazy person. When you're feeling down or lazy, doing something more challenging is going to help you bounce back quickly. This is how dopamine works, which is why it's important to start your day with a small, productive task and then move on to something slightly more challenging. So I'm going to show you my morning routine that I use to trigger my dopamine and avoid being lazy. First, I wake up immediately and I make my bed. This is a non-negotiate. Then I floss and brush my teeth. Look, I hate flossing. I hate the whole process. That's exactly why I do it. That's the point. And third, I do a skincare routine, which is the most effort of all, but it also has the highest return because it makes you feel great. For example, every time I use my microdermabrasion tool from PMD, I am regenerating my skin to make it look young. And just look at the before and afters of some of the people that use the microdermabrasion. You can see just how well their skin has regenerated, giving them flawless skin. And this is key for us guys because when you're young, your skin cells recycle every 14 days. But as you age, your skin cells start recycling up to every 60 days. However, when I use this microdermabrasion tool, you'll remove a top layer of your skin, which speeds up a cellular turnover. And this results in much better looking skin. So as soon as I'm done washing my face, I just grab my PMD tool, you pull your skin tight and I move along my face horizontally. I'll do one pass and then I'll do it one more time going vertically to make sure I didn't miss any spots. It only takes a couple of minutes every morning, but just like making my bed and brushing my teeth, it's a good way to prime dopamine for the day. Avoid being lazy and also look amazing, which every man needs. If you guys want to check out this PMD tool, I'm going to have a link down below. Voice number five. Oh, I'm too tired. If you really want to stop being lazy, you need to start improving your sleep. So here are three simple ways to help you sleep better. That's going to help you get out of being lazy. First, move your phone charger into another room. This is going to help you keep you from staying up late on your phone. Second, eliminate all light from your bedroom. If you have little small lights from your electronic devices, you can cover those lights with black tape. And third, I want you to lie on your left side. This improves blood circulation, helping you fall asleep faster and deeper. Voice number six. I shouldn't be this lazy. The reason you might feel lazy or you might feel unsuccessful is because you know what you should be doing, but you're not doing it. You know you should be cooking healthy meals, but you choose junk food instead. You know you shouldn't be working out, but you stay home. You know you should be taking care of your skin, but you neglect it. But again, all of this can change by you just simply taking oxygen. Start with your skin, for example. It's easy and it gives you instant results. Anytime you want to get out of laziness, you need to choose something where you can see an immediate result, as that's going to feed your dopamine and motivate you to keep going. If you make it a habit of cleaning your skin every morning and night, followed by moisturizing, you're going to see an immediate result in your skin and your confidence. And you truly want to take it to the next level and you invest in a personal microdermabrasion tool like this one. This tool will unclog your pores and reduce the appearance of your acne, meaning that if you deal with acne or deal with clogged pores, just one usage from this, you will see a visible difference in the clarity of your skin. Now here's the best part. If you were to do microdermabrasion at a dermatology office, you're going to get the same results, but it's going to cost you around $1,500. You need to do around 10 sessions and every session is around $150. And at the end of it, yes, you would have flawless skin. I recommend this action to anyone. But with the PMV tool, you get to do this from your home. The tool costs one-tenth of what the treatments cost, and now you get to do it whenever you want. So if you're a guy that really wants to develop a routine that's going to make you look more attractive, that's going to get you out of being lazy and make you feel as confident as possible, you know, the microdermabrasion tool is it. I've been using it for over five years and that's how good this is. Once you buy it, you won't have to replace it for years. I'm going to have it linked down below. I'm also going to have a limited time discount that's going to make this thing an absolute steal. Voice set. Oh, I'm too old to get started. See, if you didn't do anything when you were a teenager, you could start in your 20s. If you didn't achieve anything in your 20s, you can make a change in your 30s. If you didn't do anything in your 30s, you could still get started in the 40s. Do you see where I'm going with this? It is never too late to begin something no matter your age. As a matter of fact, Stan Lee, one of the most successful comic book writers in history, started writing comics at 39. Samuel L. Jackson, one of the greatest actors to ever live, didn't pursue acting as a career until he was 43. And Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, didn't start his business until he was 40. Now, by this point, we have squashed most of the voices in your head that are making you lazy using the Ikai-gi diagram by making you feel more confident, by helping you stop what others think of you. And now even showing you that you could start at any age. But truthfully, if you want to stop being lazy forever, there are three voices. You need to squash for good. Voice number eight. Oh, this isn't the right moment. You need to stop waiting for the right time because time isn't waiting for you. Instead, start with minimal progress. For example, tomorrow, work on your goals for just one minute. The next day, work for two minutes, then three minutes the day after, and so on. As your streak continues, you're going to start to capitalize on something called the sunken cost fallacy. Because you've already put a certain number of days into this, you're going to feel more invested and inclined to keep going. By day 100, you'll be working on your goals for 100 minutes, and you'll be so invested in condition that you're going to continue this streak well into the future. You're then going to realize just how much you've accomplished and how silly it was to even think this. Voice number nine. Oh, I don't have enough time. Relax. Bro, take your time. Find a good wife. Avoid pornography. Focus on being a good man, a protector, a provider, not just for others, but put yourself as well. Get up, go out, and do what you need to do to be the person you want to be. If you're feeling unsure, have a nice shower. Put on some good clothes and take care of your skin to boost your confidence. There is no better feeling that's also free than being proud of how you look. Voice number 10. I just don't care about anything. Look, if you truly want to stop being lazy forever, you need to start caring about yourself before focusing on anything else. And here's how you're going to do it in seven steps. I want you to eliminate or reduce any psychoactive substances like alcohol or caffeine. Second, eliminate or reduce any news consumption. Third, make a list of those who have hurt you. Forgive them. Fourth, accept who you are. And understand that you can't change that. Fifth, surround yourself with successful and motivated people. Six, stop worrying about the past or the future. Focus on the present. Try to serve others instead of always trying to seek to be served yourself. And if you listen to me and squash all 10 of these voices in your head, you will stop being lazy forever."

        "transcript": " What's up family? It's time to dive into 11 things us men learn about women too late. This is a conversation we definitely need to have. Now women are complex, fascinating, and let's keep it real. Often operate on a level we don't fully understand until it's too late. From emotional intelligence to the friend zone trap, these lessons can make or break your relationships. So stick around so you can avoid the mistakes most men make and I can help you build stronger, deeper connections with the ladies. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeffy style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Shane Williams, salute. Now first up on the list of 11 things us men often learn too late about women is something I don't blame most guys for not realizing. That confidence attracts but arrogance repel. Now most of us myself included, we were told that women are attracted to confident men, but I have to let you know it's a delicate balance. Women are naturally drawn to a confident man who stands tall, knows who he is, and handles himself with calm self assurance. But here's the thing, there's a fine line between confidence and arrogance. You see confidence is rooted in self belief, it's quiet. Arrogance on the other hand is loud, showy, and it's rooted in insecurity. And trust me, when I tell you, women can spot the difference from a mile away. A confident man is magnetic, but the arrogant guy will turn a woman off quicker than you know it. So I advise you to say confident but humble, and see the difference that it makes with the ladies. Now next up is something I'm still trying to learn and remind myself of all the time. And I'm married. It's to realize that listening is often more important than solving. This is something a lot of us guys struggle with because when we hear a problem, we automatically go into problem solving mode. But a lot of times that's not what your woman needs. She actually just needs to get it out. She wants to vent. A lot of times she isn't looking for your solution. She wants to be heard and understood. Too often times, myself included, we jump automatically into fixed mode. That's not helping the situation a lot of times. What she really wants is your empathy and undivided attention. And here's the thing we gotta realize. Just listening, it's a lot easier than coming up with a solution. Listening shows that you value her thoughts and feelings and it helps build a deeper connection with your late. Trust me, it's not about having all the answers. It's about being patient, present, and supportive. And realizing that listening is often better than solving is tied directly with this next point. A thing we all need to learn about women, they want you to have emotional intelligence. Understanding and responding to a woman's emotions is just as important as what you say or the action you take after listening. Women value a man who can read the room, empathize, and handle situations with sensitivity. Emotional intelligence isn't about you reacting in an overly emotional way. It's about you recognizing and processing emotions, both yours and hers, and navigating the feelings of both people with care. It shows maturity, builds trust, and helps build a deeper connection with your lady. A man who can balance strength with emotional awareness, this is a deadly combination. And that's the kind of man many women respect and are looking for in their lives. Now this next point, I might need to scream it from the mountaintop so the people in the back can hear me. You're never getting out of the friend zone. Now here's the thing, Uncle Jeff loves you and somebody who loves you tells you what you need to hear, not what you wanna hear. You're trapped if you're in the friend zone. Chances are if a woman sees you as a friend, that's how she's always gonna see you. Women recognize very quickly if they're interested in you in a romantic way. Trying to stick around and be the nice guy when you realize he isn't immediately attracted to you, that's a dead end. And oftentimes it comes off as manipulative and insincere anyway. Instead of wasting time focusing on something that isn't there and trying to change her mind, devote your energy to women who are really feeling you. Build a connection with a woman who sees your value from the jump. Because trust me, if the woman you're interested in didn't see your value in the beginning, she probably never will. If you're in the friend zone, please run for the hills. We're sticking in the category of tough love for this next point. This one might sting a little bit, but it's probably gonna hurt me more than it hurts you. Any guy you hear always saying women only want men that have money, probably don't have any women or money. I hear a lot of guys saying this in my comments, but it's just not the case. Yes, cash can grab women's attention, but not the type of women you want anyway. A woman that you're interested in will value confidence, character, and emotional depth. If you're only attracting gold diggers, remember, you're the common denominator. What are you doing wrong? Plotty women are not just looking for a fat wallet. They want a man who's confident, self-assured, is ambitious, and can hold it down emotionally. Here's the thing, you can't be broken dating. If you have no money, you won't get any women. I'll admit that. I'm not here just bumping my gums. I've been up financially, down, and treading water. To be honest, my dating experience didn't vary much, because I remain the confident, purpose-driven, ambitious guy, no matter what my pockets were looking at at the time. And women can sense that. Chasing money to impress women will leave you broke, both literally and emotionally. Work on your purpose, your confidence, and yourself first, the women will come. But that's not saying that there aren't women out there who strictly want money. But I also want to tell you a lesson you need to learn. They're pretty easy to spot. Fellas, women who are only after your money, they make it very obvious. They focus on what you have, not who you are. All you have to do is pay attention to the size. Is she always talking about your income, your job, asking for money? Always wanting some extravagant experience, or only calling you when things aren't going well? Are these the only things she's talking about? She never asks about your values, your goals, your priorities. Real relationships are built on connections, not transactions. So the spider gold digger, it's not that hard. The woman who truly values you will appreciate your ambition and your character. A gold digger is easy to spot, and she will drain your bank account and your peace of mind. Another big lesson we all need to learn about women, they want to feel safe. And this goes beyond physical safety. Women need to feel emotionally secure as well. Here's the thing. Women are often looking for a man who's consistent, reliable, and offers protection without being overbearing. A safe space means she can trust you with her thoughts, feelings, and her well-being. If you're unpredictable, dismissive, or careless with her emotions, she's not gonna stick around. Being her source of stability and security is one of the most attractive traits you can have. Trust me, fellas, if you have a woman you value, show her she's protected and respected. You easily build a relationship and a bond that lasts. Another thing I need you to keep in mind, women find independence very attractive. Translation, you need to have a life of your own outside of the relationship. You want one of the quickest ways you can turn a woman off? Be clingy. Here's the thing, yes, a woman wants you to be interested in her. She wants to spend time with you, but not all of her time. Women love a man who has his own hobbies, passions, and interests outside of the relationship and outside of her. If you're overly dependent on a woman and constantly available, it's gonna turn her off quicker than you think. It will easily come off as unambitious or clingy. Someone who's on his purpose can't spend all of his time with a significant other. When you're focused on your purpose and building your life, you naturally become more attractive. You have to remain independent. If you're striving for your goals and having somewhere to go, she'll want to follow. Now, next up is something that can be a game changer for a lot of you guys out there. Did you realize that a lot of women find self-care very attractive? Taking care of yourself first, your grooming, your mental and physical health, and your overall appearance, this naturally draws women in. It shows that you value yourself and take pride in how you present yourself to the world. Women notice when you're groomed, fit, well-dressed, and confident in your own skin. And it's not about being perfect. Women appreciate a guy who's putting in the effort to be his best self. When you're investing yourself, you not only look good, you feel good, and that confidence is very appealing. I'm here to tell you, focus on your personal growth and self-care. Investing you and the rest will fall into place. Now I want to tell you something I learned a long time ago and I want to share with you. Women are always paying attention, even when you think she isn't. They notice the small things. How not only you treat her, but how you treat others. They notice how you treat people, small gestures, and even the tone you take when you speak to people. It's not about the big moves or flashy gestures. It's how you show up in your life every day. She's paying attention to your consistency, your character, and how you make other people feel. Her and those around you. Being genuine, mindful, and every interaction, this is something women pay close attention to and give you points when you do it in a graceful, humble way. Being kind to others and a gentleman is something that will take you very far with the ladies. I want you to stay sharp, stay respectful, and remember, she's always watching. Another thing a lot of us men learn too late, women pay attention to, and appreciate your growth. Women are very attracted to men who evolve, who are consistently and constantly getting better. Whether it's leveling up your career, improving your health, or sharpening your mindset. When you're focused on yourself and pushing yourself to be better, it shows ambition, purpose, drive, and all of those characteristics are highly attracted to women. On the other hand, if you're a guy who's stagnant, especially if you're not where you need to be in your life and you reach the plateau, this will turn your lady off. Remember what I said earlier. You don't have to be at the finish line to attract women. You just have to be pushing towards it. Women don't feel like they're carrying a relationship or that you're stagnant in life. This is emotionally draining. So make sure you keep growing, keep learning, keep evolving, keep getting better. This is something that's firstly important for you. Secondly, you'll do much better with the fairer sex. You'll naturally become more appealing, not just to her, but to yourself in the whole world. Okay, so there you have it. 11 things us men often learn too late about the ladies. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section anything you believe I left off of today's list that can help the Stalogy family. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about 10 casual items we wear that the women love to see.

Now we've all been there, spending our hard earned extra cash on things that really don't add value to your life. Whether it's flashy products or habits that drain your wallet, these mistakes can hold you back from building the life you deserve. But don't worry, I'm here to help you identify these traits, save money, and spend much more wisely. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, rooming, and dating. If you're into all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Big Q1977, S-U-L-U. Now first up on the list without a doubt, in my opinion, is one of the worst things you can waste your money on. Cheap shoes, especially cheap dress shoes. You have to keep in mind that shoes are the foundation of not only your outfit, but your style confidence. So cutting corners when you're buying your shoes is definitely a big mistake. When it comes to shoes, you usually get what you pay for. It's hard to buy cheap leather and get it right. Cheap shoes wear out quickly and you'll constantly find yourself replacing them, losing money in the long run. Plus cheap shoes are often uncomfortable, they hurt your feet, and they offer little support. Instead what I recommend you do, especially when it comes to your dress shoes, your wing tips, your loafers, invest in the highest quality pair of shoes, you can reasonably afford. Your dress shoes, remember, are something most people notice when they take a look at your outfit, especially the ladies. And when you buy a durable, stylish pair of shoes, it shows that you're a man who recognizes quality. Whatever you do when shopping for shoes, don't cut quarters on the foundation of your wardrobe. Now next up, I have one of the hugest waste of money, especially in our modern times. Do you throw away money constantly upgrading your phone? Now I know it's easy to get caught up in the height of the new phone release, but let's keep it real. Most upgrades, there are only usually minor upgrades. You might get a little better camera or a new feature that you barely use. But you'll notice if you buy a new phone every year, it's pretty much just like the phone you had last year. Is that worth spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every year? Probably not. And the phones that we buy nowadays are built to last several years at least. So upgrading frequently is just you falling for the marketing trap. So instead, fellas, I recommend you invest your money in something that would elevate your life. Don't let these tech companies play you. Now next up is something we waste money on that I'm glad I was taught about a long time ago. You should really, if ever, buy a brand new car. Here's the thing, when you buy that brand new shiny whip, the moment you drive it off the lot, you lose thousands of dollars in value just like that. That depreciation hits very hard and you're basically just throwing money away. Besides, new cars usually come with higher insurance rates and features you'll barely use. What you want to do instead, buy a slightly used car. Maybe one two or three years older. Especially nowadays, you're gonna get the same amount of reliability and the same style at a lot less. Let some other sucker take the depreciation of a brand new car. Because smart money is all about value, not flash. Don't let a brand new car wreck your wallet. Now I want to help you avoid one of the biggest money wasters when it comes to style. Don't break the bank on overpriced designer items. When you want to talk about fleshing money down the toilet, just because a piece of clothing has a brand name and a huge logo, doesn't mean it's worth the price tag. Most of the time, you're paying for branding, not better quality. A $500 t-shirt is not going to do anything a $50 one won't do. And you can easily find well-made stylish pieces that don't break the bank. It's not that hard. Investing in high quality timeless pieces is a much better smarter move than chasing trends or flashy logo. You gotta keep in mind style isn't about the brand, it's about how you carry yourself. Now next up, we have a big time money waster that people actually call, I'm talking about financially smart people, a regressive tax. It's a tax on us people that don't have a whole lot of money. I'm talking about wasting your money on lottery tickets. Ideas spending your money on something that has ridiculously low levels of return on investment, telling you first hand, you're probably not gonna win. Meanwhile, these small purchases of scratch-offs or lottery tickets, over time drain your wallet. Instead of wasting your money on unrealistic dreams, invest your money wisely. On things that build wealth like savings, stocks, or investing in a new skill. The real winners are the ones that make smart financial moves, not ones that throw away money and give it to the state. You're much better financially betting on smart financial moves than hoping on pure luck. So skip the scratch-offs and focus on building your own opportunities. Now next up is something we all get caught slipping on, myself included. I need to work on this one. You're wasting money on those unused subscriptions. You're talking about a modern development that definitely drains most people's wallets. This is it. Those 10 to 20 dollar monthly charges add up so quickly. Especially ones you're not using. Here's the thing. Companies counting you forgetting you even got the subscription in the first place. Because they're small expenses, they kind of quietly drain your bank account month after month. And the companies love that. Take it from me. You don't need Netflix and Hulu and Disney Plus and HBO Max. Really, I'm not just talking to you, I'm talking to myself as well. So what I want you to do, take a look at the subscriptions you have. Do you really use them? Keep the ones that you absolutely need and cut out the ones that aren't adding value to your life. Cutting these out is an easy way to save money and to move that money to something you actually want and will use. Now next up, I have a money waster that definitely catches my younger guys slipping. Please tell me you're not wasting your money on bottle service at the club. Now without a doubt, this is one of the hugest money traps for the modern man. Do guys that go out to the club and spend hundreds and thousands of dollars for an overpriced bottle of liquor? This definitely isn't the move. Here's the thing, when you buy that bottle that has an insane markup, let's keep it real. It's only going to last an hour or two and you're paying for the appearance, not the experience. You're basically paying to flex, to look good in a moment. And for who exactly? Are you flexing for women who are looking for material gain? That's who's really going to be impressed by this bottle service. True confidence doesn't come from flashy displays. It's all about how you carry yourself. Save your cash and leave the bottle service to other guys who are trying to impress. So when you're going out for a night on the town, keep it classy, not flashy. Now next up is a money waste that we all probably get caught up in, at least from time to time. Please don't get caught making impulse buys. Now those spur of the moment purchases might feel good at the time, but you're setting yourself up for financial regret, especially when you wind up with things in a long run you don't need want or use. Whether it's flashy gadgets, trendy clothes, or random stuff online, these small decisions add up very quickly and can easily blow your budget. Instead, what I recommend you do when you see something you really, really want, take a step back and think on it for at least 24 hours. Give it some thought in the next day. If you still really want it, it might be cool to grab it. Avoiding impulse buys helps you save for what really matters. Things that bring true value to your life. Things that improve your style, confidence and overall lifestyle. When it comes to impulse buys, try to stay disciplined. Your future self will thank you. Now we're going to talk about a money pit that's been catching people slipping decade after decade. I'm talking about that unused fitness equipment. Now we've all been there. You buy that new treadmill, weightset, or fancy exercise bike knowing it's going to transform your life. But too much down the line is in the corner collecting dust. The hard truth is fitness equipment doesn't work if you don't. If you already aren't on a consistent workout plan, some new pieces of equipment isn't going to be the motivation to get you there. Ask yourself an honest question. Are you committed to doing the work it takes to get in shape? If you're not, start with simple low cost fitness options like body weight exercise or reasonably affordable gym membership. Being smart about your fitness investments keeps you watered in shape for years to come. Invest your money wisely and don't let it sit idle like that fitness equipment. Now I gotta take some time to get on my door dasher and Uber Eats guys out there. Don't waste your money on daily takeout and delivery food. You want to talk about a bad habit that's a money drain? That daily takeout is definitely it. Those 10 to 20 dollar lunches or dinners here and there quickly add up. It may not seem like a lot of money at the time, but can easily add up to hundreds or not thousands of dollars over the year. Plus you're not getting the same value or control that you get over your eating and your spending when you eat from home. Meal prepping and making your own meals isn't just cheaper, it's also healthier. And what I recommend you do is instead of hitting that app and getting door dash, invest that money in your kitchen skill. You will feel better, look better, and your account balance will thank you. Now next up I want to bring it back to a style category that's a waste of money. Please don't throw your money away on that faux leather jacket. Now I get it, it might be very tempting to save a few bucks because they are a cheaper alternative than the real thing. But trust me, you're not doing yourself any favors. Faux leather just doesn't age well. It cracks, it peels, and it loses its look way quicker than the genuine article. On top of that, the faux leather variety often lacks the durability and the classic looks. A high quality leather jacket brings to your wardrobe. What I suggest you do, save up for the real thing. It's the timeless piece that's gonna last much longer, it's gonna look better, it's gonna age extremely well, and it never will go out of style. You're tempted to buy a faux leather jacket, I'd rather you buy a real one or have no leather jacket at all. Okay so they have 11 of the worst things I spend wasting our money on. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section anything you believe I left off this list that are money drains on the style G family. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the 10 worst speaker mistakes guys tend to make. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " Now today we're diving into a topic that can be a game changer for any man. Why disappearing for a while can be exactly what you need to transform your life. Now fellas, disappearing for a while isn't about running away. It's about resetting, refocusing, and coming back stronger than ever. Whether it's stepping away to gain mental clarity, recharge your energy, or break bad habits, disappearing for the scene for a time can help you level up in ways you never imagined. So with that in mind on today's video, I'm going to share with you around 10 and 11 things that you'll notice improving your life if you just disappear for a short time. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like James, Princess, salut. Now first up, without a doubt, one of the greatest benefits of disappearing from the scene for a while it gives you some time for self-reflection. Now for all of us, life moves fast. And when you're on the daily grind, you don't have the time to see exactly where you're headed. Taking a step back gives you the space to reflect on your relationships, your goals, and your priority. And this is much easier to do without all the noise. When you take that step back, it gives you a chance to figure out in your life what's working, what's not working, and to make some necessary changes. You can make some intentional moves that align with the man you're trying to be. Trust me, self-reflection is the foundation for personal growth. And when you take a step back, a little alone time can do wonders for any man's life. Now to me, one of my favorite pros when it comes to taking a step away from the scene is that it allows you to gain perspective. Here's the thing, when you're stuck in that day-to-day grind, it's easy to get stuck in the weeds. It's very difficult to step back and see the big picture. And when you do take that step back, it just gives you the ability to see things not so granularly, not on the surface level, but from a broader perspective. And when you do that, you can get the lay of the land in your life, start to notice what's important in your life, what's draining your energy, and where perhaps you need to focus more of your efforts and your time. And what I love about stepping away, distance allows you to see things that are going on your life with fresher eyes. And when you have a new take and fresher eyes on your life, it's easy to make new and better decisions. Whether it's about work, relationships, or personal growth, taking a step back gives you that perspective that can be the key to leveling up your life. Take a step back and gain some perspective. Now next up without a doubt is one of the most powerful results of disappearing for a while. It gives you the ability to break some of your bad habits. You see, here's the thing. When you're caught up in your day to day grind, it's easy to get lost in your routine and not realize the bad habits you might have started to develop. Stepping back gives you the ability to identify and address patterns that no longer serve you. Maybe it's overspending, poor diet habits, or you're wasting time on things that bring no value to your life. And when you hit that reset button, it gives you the ability to replace these bad habits with more productive ones. Take it from me, a fresh start might be exactly what you need to build a better, stronger you. And breaking bad habits is closely tied to the next benefit that comes from stepping off the scene for a little bit. It allows you to cultivate discipline. You see, when you take that time away and recognize those bad habits and start to get into routines that replace them with productive ones, you're going to naturally cultivate some self discipline. When you're able to focus on yourself with less distraction, it gives you the time to build these strong habits. Discipline is the backbone to success, whether it's hitting the gym, developing a new skill, or sticking to a routine and taking time away allows you to cultivate the discipline to achieve these goals. Time away allows you to lock in on these habits and commit to doing the work that it takes day in to day out to become a better man. And the great thing about cultivating discipline is not about perfection, it's all about consistency. When you step off the scene and cultivate discipline, it sets you up for success in every area of your life. A lot of what we're discussing today when it comes to the benefits of disappearing for a while falls on the umbrella of the next pro. It definitely allows you to focus on your personal growth. Stepping away from the scene, in my opinion, turbo charges personal growth. You see, when you get it away from the everyday distractions, it gives you all the space you need to work on becoming the best version of you. Whether it's learning a new skill, sharpening your mindset, losing a few pounds, taking some time away is the perfect chance to level up no matter what you're trying to accomplish. You see, the thing is personal growth does not happen by accident. It takes intentionality and a lot of effort and focus. And stepping away for a while allows you to lock into your personal growth goal and to put in the time and effort it takes to create a better, stronger you. And to do it without unnecessary interruptions. If you want to turbo charge your personal growth, step off the scene for a little while. Now, next up is one of the most underrated, but no less powerful benefits of disappearing for a while. It allows you to reevaluate your relationships. You see, when you take a step back and give yourself some space, it allows you to get a clearer picture of who is really in your corner. Time apart allows you to see who supports you, who drains you, or who might just be along for the ride. Now, it's not about cutting people off. It's about realizing what connections truly matter to you and your life. And then when you come back, it allows you to focus time and energy on those true connections and get rid of the unproductive relationships. And when you do take this space, it allows you to remember one of the most powerful things I like to keep in mind. Everybody can't go. You may realize that some relationships have run their course. They might have been just for that season. And when you reemerge on the scene, it allows you to prioritize the relationships that elevate and support you. The right connections in your life can motivate, inspire, and help you become a better man. And that's tied very closely to the next pro that comes from disappearing from the scene for a while. It allows you to avoid overexposure. Here's the thing, when you're always on the scene, people can start to take you for granted and it lessens the impact of your presence. Even when it comes to your acquaintances and friendships, sometimes less is more. And here's one of the benefits of it. Stepping away from a while creates mystery. And when you do step back on the scene, your return is much more noticed and appreciated. Think about it like a great outfit or a statement coat. If you wear it every day, it loses some of its impact and people notice a lot less. That's the same for your presence. And besides that, the time away allows you to recharge and come back on the scene stronger than ever. Stepping away for a while keeps your value high and your moves more personal. Take it from me, disappear for a while. Don't overdo it, make them miss you. Next up is a huge upside to stepping off the scene for a while. It allows you to rediscover your passion. Here's the thing, when we're caught up in our daily routine, the monotonous grind of life, it allows you to lose touch on what really matters to you. When you disappear for a while, it gives you the time to reevaluate and see what you truly love. Whether it's a hobby, a dream you put on the back burner for a while, or something new you've always wanted to learn. Taking some time off the scene gives you the time to explore these things in a way that could rejuvenate you. When you rediscover your passion, it brings energy, focus, and purpose back to your life. Who couldn't use that? Taking some time away and realizing what really energizes your life is a great way to level up and live your life with intention. It's a love that disappearing for a while gives you a chance to rebuild your confidence. Here's the thing, in that day-to-day grind, we're all going to inevitably have some setbacks. And when you do hit those obstacles and setbacks, it's only natural that can damage your self-belief. Stepping back gives you a chance to reset, work on yourself, and remind yourself what you're truly capable of. Take this time to sharpen your skills, improve your appearance, and achieve some small goals that will help you build momentum. And as you start to grow, you'll naturally feel more capable, stronger, and self-assured. And when you take the time to step back and rebuild your confidence, you'll come back stronger than ever. You'll be unstoppable and able to take on whatever life throws your way. And in that last tip, I noticed one of the things you can do when you're rebuilding your confidence, you can improve your appearance. And that links closely to the next benefit of stepping away. You can create a whole new image. Here's the thing, sometimes you can grow out of the way you're currently presenting yourself. Sometimes you want a fresh start on how you show up in the world. And taking a step back gives you the perfect opportunity to reinvent yourself. Whether it's upgrading your wardrobe, improving your grooming, or refining how you carry yourself, this gives you the perfect ability to be the man and present yourself in a way that you've always wanted to. And a fresh image isn't just about how you look. It's about the confidence in the mindset that comes along with it. And here's the thing, changing how you look not only affects the way the world sees you, it affects how you see yourself. So if you don't like the way you're showing up in the world, take a step back and create a new image. And all the benefits we've been talking about on today's video that come from disappearing for a while leads to this ultimate goal. It allows you to come back on the scene refreshed and focused. Here's the thing, for all of us, sometimes life can be overwhelming. And you start to run on empty. Stepping away for a while gives you time to recharge your entity, gain some mental clarity, clear your mind and realign your goals. All things that will definitely level up your life. And when you take the time to reset, you come back sharper, more focused, more on point, more on purpose. You'll realize you're more motivated and much better equipped to take on any obstacles life throws your way. And when the positive benefits of this refocus and sharpening, it allows you to see opportunities you might have overlooked in the past. Nothing like returning to the scene with a fresh perspective and a clear purpose. So disappear for a while. And when you return, you'll be ready to dominate. Okay, so there you have it. 11 powerful ways how disappearing for a while can transform your life. Now, do me a favor.

        "transcript": " Now fellas on today's video, we're gonna get into a topic that can easily help you elevate your game. How to choose the right cologne for any occasion. Now I'm sure you've heard from many sources, this channel included a man should wear fragrance. And that's all well and good. But how do you make sure you're using the right cologne for any situation you may find yourself into? That's what I'm gonna help you with on today's video. You see a man's scent is his signature. It's personal, it's memorable, and it can create a lasting impression. But how do you make sure you're choosing the right cologne for you in any situation? If you've ever wondered how to properly navigate the world of colognes, you're in the right place. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics, such as style, grooming, and date. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Anthony Harmon, salute. Now before we get too deep into how you can go about choosing the right cologne for any occasion, we need to discuss why choosing the right cologne matters at all. You see, first things first, we gotta talk about why choosing the right cologne is important. You see your scent is often the first thing people notice about you, and it's definitely something they will remember. A great cologne can enhance your confidence, compliment your outfit, and just overall make you more attractive. So choosing the right one, of course it's a big deal. The key is choosing the right cologne for any occasion or situation you find yourself in. Because choosing the wrong one, that can be a disaster. Imagine choosing a bold, heavy fragrance for a casual daytime summer event. Definitely the wrong move. So let's go into a step-by-step process to make sure you make the right choice. Now just like with anything or any situation you find yourself in when you're trying to make a decision, first you have to have an understanding of the basics that go into it. So before you can choose the right cologne, I need to make sure you understand the basics of fragrance. First up, you have to understand cologne is more than just about what you smell in the bottle. It's about how that cologne interacts with your individual body chemistry and your skin, and how the scent is perceived as it comes off of your skin. And what goes into that, first up we have the notes. The notes are the building box of your cologne. They're the ingredients that make up your scent, and they come in layers. First off, we have the top layer of notes. This is what you smell immediately upon spraying the cologne on your skin and for the next several minutes. Then as the top notes fade away, we move into the mid notes. The mid notes come about during around 15 to 30 minutes after application. Then rounding out your notes, we have the base notes. The base notes lay the foundation of what you're gonna smell the rest of the day. Your base notes are gonna stick around hours after application. Now that we know about notes, we need to move into the different concentrations of cologne. Now when it comes to us guys, usually you have two or three options. An odor toilette, odor parfum, and parfum. These are labeled based on the concentration of perfume oil in each one. The least amount of perfume oil out of these three odor toilette. This cologne will typically last you maybe four to six hours. The next step up, we have the odor parfum. This one will last you about six to eight hours. And then the one that's not seen as often, but is stronger, we have parfum. And this is your most concentrated option and will last throughout the day. Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's get into how you choose the right cologne for the occasion. You see, choosing the right scent, you wanna make sure you're matching the situation you find yourself in. Just like you wouldn't wear a tuxedo to the gym, the cologne you're using has to match the occasion and what you're doing. Here's a breakdown of different occasions you might find yourself in and what type of cologne will work best. First up, let's talk about what you might wear to the office or your workplace on an everyday basis. In this situation, you want something light, clean, and crispy. Think light floral, citrusy, or aquatic cologne. I'm talking about some classics, maybe like an aque de joe or Dior Sauvage. When you're in the workplace, you wanna scent that's refreshing and approachable. Now let's move into a casual daytime scent. Something you might wear on the weekends or when you're running errands. Something that's noticeable, but approachable, and not off-putting. One of my favorite for a casual daytime, Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue. But what about the right cologne for your evening events? Here's where you wanna bring out the woody, the rich, the spicy, or oriental fragrances that have a lot of depth. I'm thinking colognes like Victor & Ross Spice Bomb. Since that exudes confidence, sophistication. These are the type of colognes that are ideal for dinner, dates, or parties. How about for wedding or formal situations? Here's where you want something refined, sophisticated, and elegant. This is when you break out your grown man cologne. Something you might've spent a little bit more on. Perfect choice for this situation, the King of Colognes, Creed of Ventus. And lastly, let's talk about what you might wear for active or outdoor settings. Here's where you want something earthy. Citrusy, crisp, and clean. You want something that rolls with you, but won't overwhelm you. A great choice in this category, the all-time classic, David Alff's Cool Water. In today's video, we're talking about how to pick the right cologne for any occasion. And while that's important, it's not the only thing that should go into consideration when choosing the right fragrance. You also need to choose the right cologne to match your personality. That's because the cologne you select becomes a part of your personal brand. You want to make sure it matches who you are and the image you're trying to project. When choosing the cologne, think about your personality. Are you the bold, extroverted type? Are you the confident type A guy? Or are you more the laid-back, easy-going fellow? Whatever your vibe, there's a fragrance to match. So let's get into what you should think about when you're trying to align your cologne with your personality. If you believe you're the confident and bold guy, you want to grab a fragrance that's spicy, woody. Maybe a heavier Oriental scent. For you, I highly recommend one of my favorites, Tom Ford's Oodwood. But what if you're the laid-back, casual, easy-going type? Then I recommend something a little lighter, a little crispy, a little citrusy. Think along the lines of classes like Easey Miyake or Nautica Voyage. Or what if you consider yourself more of the sophisticated, refined, elegant type? For you, I recommend colognes such as Gucci Guilty Absolute, Terra de Maze, or one of my personal favorites, Tom Ford's Ombre Leather. Now I should kind of be running to shape what you need to think about when choosing your cologne. But it's very important that when you're choosing it, you go through the steps correctly, meaning test your fragrance before you buy it. Because here's the thing, no matter how many recommendations about colognes you get from me or other sources, every fragrance will interact with your individual body chemistry differently than anyone else. So although I can give you a head start, trying it yourself is very important. Here's what I recommend you do. Go shopping for fragrances and have maybe a couple in mind you wanna try. Then grab the first cologne you have in mind and spread directly on your wrist or on the back of your hand. That's because it's very important to remember, just smelling the cologne, that's not good enough. You need to let it interact with your body chemistry to really know how it works for you. Walk around for at least about an hour. This gives the cologne a chance to go through all its notes. Remember, the top, the mids, and the base. After about an hour, you'll have a great idea about how that cologne works for you. Then after that, you're ready to try another scent. Try your second one on the opposite hand or opposite wrist and repeat the process, letting it settle for about an hour. Then you're done for the day. I don't recommend you try more than two colognes on any outing. What can happen if you smell too many of them, you'll get what's called nose blindness. It'll be very hard for you to distinguish between the different fragrances. So stick to one to two in each shopping session. And after you've done a good job of getting used to shopping for colognes, then I want you to start to build what's called a fragrance wardrobe. Just in fact, you have different clothing for different occasions. You're going to have different colognes for different situations. You want to make sure you have a cologne each time that suits your needs for that day. First up, I recommend you have what I call a daily workhorse. This is going to be your versatile office fragrance, your everyday signature scent. Something clean, crisp, and light, like blue to Chanel or Prada Lone. Then next up, I want you to have what I call an evening showstopper. You want something that's bold and attention grabbing. Great for going out to the bar on a nice date. Something like one of my personal favorites, YSL's Live Under The Week, The Lone. I want you to invest in what I call your special occasion gem. This is the one you don't break out very often. But when you do, you make a statement. These are your splurge colognes, maybe like a Cree Green Iris Tweed or Baccarat Rouge 540. After you've gotten that out of the way, make sure you have seasonal scents. For example, you want spring and summer. Your warm weather scents, light, citrusy. And then for the fall and winter, as the temperature drops, you want woody, spicy, warm, a bit heavier. So we talked about how to choose the right cologne, how to match it to your personality, how to build a fragrance wardrobe. But now we need to get back to another basic. I want to make sure you're applying cologne correctly. When you're using your fragrances, the key is to make sure your scent comes off as subtle. Your fragrance should speak for you, but it shouldn't scream. To me, I'd rather you wear no cologne at all than to apply it too heavily or in the wrong way. Most of the time, follow this rule. Two to four sprays is the most you need of almost any cologne. And you want to apply it directly to your post points. Post points are areas on your body that emit heat and help the cologne project off of you. Think of areas like behind your ears, your wrist, or the nape of your neck. Apply your cologne to your post points and it'll be last throughout the day. And some common mistakes I want you to avoid, don't spray directly on your clothing. It has to interact with your skin. And please, no cologne clouds and walking through it. You know how much fragrance is not hitting you and hitting the ground? And one of the mistakes I used to make when I was a young G, don't rub the cologne in after you put it on. What you're doing is you're breaking up the layers of notes. You're not letting the cologne go through all three layers. Now, all in all, choosing the right cologne is about matching the occasion, aligning with your personality, and understanding fragrances that will help you build a great cologne wardrobe. And when you get it right, your cologne becomes an extension of you. It becomes part of your personal brand. It's something people remember about you and you can leave it last in impression, no matter where you go. And remember, no matter what type of cologne you decide to wear, whether it's a bold, heavy evening scent or light, citrusy, crisp fragrance, confidence is key when rocking your cologne. Make sure you wear it like you mean it. Okay, so there you have it, my step-by-step guide to make sure you're choosing the right cologne for any occasion. Now, do me a favor, let me know in the comment section any recommendations you have for the Stylgene family to make sure they get the right cologne for them. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the 16th greatest colognes of all time. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " It's time for another video to make sure you feel and look your absolute best. As in today's video, we're getting to 11 style trends in 2025 every season gentlemen should consider. Now you know I'm all about keeping it classic, but that doesn't mean you can't sprinkle in some modern touches to make sure you stay on point and keep it fresh. From sleek athleisure to refined accessories, these are the trends you should be aware of to keep you grown sexy and sophisticated. So if you're ready to level up your wardrobe and turn heads for all the right reasons, let's get into it. And if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell and join us until my returning friends like Josh Thrasher, salute. Now first up on the list of the 11 style trends every older guy should consider in 2025 is one of my absolute favorite and I happen to be rocking an example of it right now. You should consider pastel colors. Pastels like light green, soft blues and light pinks give your wardrobe a modern updated feel. It's a great way to incorporate color into your wardrobe without stepping too far out of your comfort zone. Now I'm like a lot of guys older or younger. I stick to a lot of gray's, navy's and black, but wearing muted pastel colors is a way, like I said, to introduce color without feeling like you're going too far. Plus the shades of pastels look good on a wide range of skin tones. Whether we're talking about a pastel blazer, polo or some chinos, these colors will help you look sharp, confident and age-appropriate. One of the keys to rocking these pastel colors pair them with neutral colors in the west of your fit. Trust me, pastels are low-key stylus flex. You didn't know you needed. One of my favorite style trends over the last several years continues into 2025 and I strongly recommend it for the OGs. You want to rock tailored athleisure. Tailored athleisure can be a game changer for OGs. It allows you to have a relaxed, comfortable look, but doing it in a way that's put together and not sloppy. I'm talking about things like tailored jokers, smart zip-ups and fitted hoodies bring polish to your relaxed, casual vibes, making your casual wear look intentional, not just thrown together. I absolutely love rocking tailored athleisure when I'm doing things like running errands, a casual weekend get-together, or grabbing coffee with friends. It's a way to stay relaxed, casual, but still age-appropriate. And one of the easiest ways to adapt tailored athleisure into your wardrobe stick with some neutrals and high-quality fabrics that easily give you a grown man vibe. Tailored athleisure is stylish, practical and versatile and it shows you can rock casual wear without sacrificing class. Now one of the easiest ways to add some visual appeal to your outfits without going too far is simply add some patterns. A key style trend for 2025? Plad patterns. Great thing about plaid being on trend is easy to adopt for the OGs. It's timeless, versatile and perfect for adding a little big character to your looks when you usually just rock solid colors. It's a great way to add some character and personality without going overboard with loud, garish patterns. Whether it's a classic flannel, a plaid sharp blazer, or a subtle check-tie, a nice plaid pattern works for almost any occasion. But remember it's all about balance. For us, OGs, you're better sticking with muted, smaller patterns are much better, and we'll convey a sophisticated and grown look. And the great thing about plaid, it adds some visual depth to your outfits and it pairs very effortlessly with neutral items you might already be rocking in your rotation. Trust me, plaid isn't just for lumberjacks anymore, it's a staple in any grown man's wardrobe. Now next up on the list of the 11 style trends older guys should consider in 2025 is an example that the more things change, the more the state is sane. You definitely want to incorporate some workwear inspired items into your rotation. Workwear inspired pieces are definitely a power move for the OG in 2025. What you want to think about when it comes to workwear pieces, we're talking about rugged yet refined things like chore jackets, a trucker jacket, utility pants, and flannel line vests are functional, durable, and add effortless style. And the great thing I love about workwear inspired pieces, they give off a rugged masculine feel. And they're very practical for everyday wear, and they work for just about every guy out there. And to me, workwear's timeless appeal lies in its versatility. It's tough enough for casual settings, but you still can rock it in some smart casual situation. I now absolutely love workwear in neutral colors like navy, gray, olive, black, and khaki, all giving you that strong rugged feel, but in a polished way. You have a style that's masculine, confident, and built to last. Now next up, we have one of my favorite accessory trends for 2025. Older guys can't go wrong rocking minimalist watches. In my opinion, minimalist watches are the perfect accessory for grown men in 2025. Watches aren't just about telling time, they're a statement of style and sophistication. And minimalist watches with a sleek, classic design work for a wide range of guys in a wide range of situations. They give you a sleek, polished profile without trying too hard. And they're versatile enough to pair with just about anything. You can wear a minimalist watch with everything from a tailored suit to a casual weekend outfit. Going on a date, you have to put on some flashy watch to make a statement. Classic tones like black, silver, gold do enough on their own. They just help contribute to you having a vibe of understated elegance. And I'm just of the opinion a man, older or not, should wear a watch every day. And if you want to watch this going to work with a wide range of situations with a wide range of outfits, you can never go wrong with a minimalist watch. Now next up, we have a style trend for 2025. That's right on time for a lot of us OGs. You can't go wrong rocking in 2025. Relaxed fit trousers. Relaxed fit trousers are definitely a style of pants you want to embrace in this new year. The great thing about relaxed fit trousers, they're the perfect mix of comfort and sophistication. Fitting easily on our older bodies, giving us room to breathe without coming off as sloppy like an oversized or baggy pair of pants would. I can't emphasize enough the relaxed modern trouser isn't a baggy one. It's tailored just enough to look sharp but give you ease of movement. And the great thing about them, they pair with just about anything. A blazer, a sweater, an Oxford button down. And relaxed trousers are ideal for the older guy, and that includes a lot of us, that want to prioritize comfort and ease of movement without sacrificing class and style. Whether you're at the office on the town or out on a date, a relaxed trouser is a great way to pull off a confident, stylish, comfortable and sophisticated look in 2025. Now next up is another trend that falls right in the wheelhouse for us older guys in 2025. You definitely want to rock monochromatic outfits. Thankfully for us OGs, monochromatic looks are appointed emphasis in 2025. Now monochromatic looks meaning wearing different shades of the same color throughout your outfit are sleek, stylish and easy to put off for just about every guy. They give you a sleek, clean, polished look that's modern and still timeless. For us older guys, it's a simple way to add sophistication to our outfits. Whether it's all black, gray, navy, or earthy neutral tones, monochromatic looks not only make you look sleek and stylish, they make you look slimmer as well. And they easily make you look taller and put together. We all can use that. The key is to pull off this look in a more advanced way. You want to mix different textures with your monochromatic looks. And the great thing about the monochromatic trend is low effort, time is classic and versatile, can't recommend enough for the OG in 2025, rock those monochromatic outfits. Now next up I have another style trend in 2025 that's right above Alley because it blends comfort and sophistication. You definitely want to throw into your outfits some chunky knits. Where we're talking about an item to blend style and comfort effortlessly, we're talking about the chunky knit. The great thing about chunky knits and a lot of other pieces we're talking about in today's video, they're extremely versatile, pairing with a wide range of looks. I'm talking about anything from casual and smart casual to anything in between. Wear it on its own, layer it under a blazer, over a crisp button down, or layer it over a great tailored outerwear piece. Another great thing about the chunky knit, it adds some visual detail with that texture. The texture helps add a level sophistication, especially when you pair it with trousers or boots. Plus chunky knits, you know they're going to keep you warm. Not to mention they come in a wide range of timeless colors that will appeal to every guy's style, person, and one of the things I love about some of these trends we're talking about today, the chunky knit, it will never go out of style. It's the perfect mix of elevated and effortless. Next up on the list of the style trends that's OG should rock in 2025 is something I've always been recommending, but it happens to be on point this year. You definitely want to grab yourself one tour, several smart casual blazer. Now, in my opinion, the smart casual blazer is a must have for the OG because it has a perfect balance of put together and relaxed. It allows you to be comfortable and polished at the same time. A lot of us as we get older, we still want to be on point with our style, but we also don't want to come off as too formal or too stiff. That's where the smart casual blazer comes in. It's a way to dress up your look without feeling overdressed, especially to unstruct your blazer without the padding. These type of blazers are so versatile, wearing with trousers, with jeans, with chinos, they can instantly elevate any look. And to me, the smart casual blazer will be on point in 2025 and 10 and 20 years from now as well. Smart casual blazer offers structure without overdoing it. You definitely want to grab one or two smart casual blazers in 2025. Now for the next recommendation from the older guy to try in 2025, we're headed back to the accessory category. You definitely want to consider a statement pair of glasses. A statement pair of glasses can be a game changer for the OG because it allows you to add some person to your look without saying a word. As you age, your style should evolve and a bold pair of frames are a great way to stand out in the crowd. You want to keep in mind accessories add that final detail to your look, taking it to the next level. Whether we're talking about an oversized pair, colorful or unique shape, statement glasses add confidence and visual appeal to your look. And of course, for a lot of us older guys, they're going to serve a dual purpose. Not only are you going to look good, we'll be able to see better. You want to make sure you choose frames that match your face shape and your personality style. They're a great way to add a focal point to your ensemble in 2025. Next up is the style trend I highly recommend because I really believe in it. You want to make sure your style is sustainable. You want to make sure you're picking sustainable fashion pieces. I'm not a huge fan of fast fashion. Although I must admit, I will grab some of those pieces from time to time. To me, shopping sustainably has two purposes. Not only is it eco-friendly, but I believe it's better for your wardrobe. When you shop in a sustainable way, you invest in high quality pieces you're going to keep for a long time. And as OGs, I highly recommend we invest in high quality pieces that are timeless and will stand as test of time like we will. You're actually making sure that your style is thought out and intentional. By opting for sustainability, you're investing in a wardrobe that not only is timeless and versatile, is eco-friendly, lessen waste, and helps you keep looking polished and sharp for decades to come. Okay, so there you have it. 11 Style Trends I Believe Every Older Guy Should Consider in 2025.

        "transcript": " Now today we're diving into a fascinating topic. One is all about style, history, and culture, and how fashion evolves over time. That's right, we're gonna dig into exactly why men stopped wearing hats. Now I'm sure you've seen those old school photos of gentlemen rocking sharp suits and topping it off with a classic fedora or stylish bowler. Back in the day, a hat just wasn't an accessory. It was an essential part of every man's wardrobe. So what happened? How did something so iconic go from a must have to something rarely seen? Let's wrap it taste about it. And if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss ferris men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Carlos Baxley, salute. Now to figure out why men stopped wearing hats, we gotta figure out how they became so prevalent in the first place. We're gonna begin with the rise of the hat as a symbol of status and practicality. We need to start at the heyday of hats. We're talking about the early of 20th century where wearing a hat was more than just a fashion statement. It was a cultural norm. It represented respectability, sophistication, and even status. Whether it was a fedora, a bowler, or a flat cat, every man had his go-to hat. Why you ask? Well, for starters, it was for practicality. The hat protected you from the elements. Whether we're talking about rain, snow, sleet, you would often find yourself outdoors much more than you will nowadays. Whether you were walking to work, catching a trolley, or spending time in unheated spaces, a hat was a necessity. It wasn't just to be stylish, but that doesn't mean back in the day, style wasn't a consideration. A hat just wasn't for practicality. It oftentimes was a marker of class. A sharp stylist fedora often indicated you were a man of business. While a newsboy cat might say you were part of the working class, hats often told a story about who you were, where you were coming from, or even where you were headed in life. So when and why did this change? How can we saw a drop in the wearing of hats? Well, this is tied to a couple of cultural shifts. Major cultural shifts at that. We traced this back to around the mid-20th century. The first cultural shift that was a catalyst, a rise of casual fashion. After World War II, men started dressing down more. Wearing a more relaxed, casual look. Especially around the 1950s, we saw men starting to incorporate some classic casual styles. Leather jackets, jeans, t-shirts, all of these items started to become much more popular. And because the hat was tied to a more formal aesthetic, it didn't necessarily fit this more relaxed vibe a lot of men started to go for. Another huge factor was another cultural shift, the car. With the increased accessibility of the automobile, men spent less time walking or jumping on and off public transportation. When you hop in and out of a car, a hat becomes less practical and more of an inconvenience. I mean, let's face it. Trying to wear a fedora in a low-ceiling car can be extremely uncomfortable. Tied that with the fact that men were less and less exposed to the elements, the need for the hat started to diminish. Now, another huge cultural shift that played a huge part, we call this one the Kennedy Effect, how a president changed the game. Now, fellas, we can't talk about the decline of the hat without mentioning John F. Kennedy. This man is often credited with a fair or not for killing off the hat. So how did this happen? You see, JFK was one of the first US presidents to make public appearances without a hat. And because his youthful modern vibe resonated with a lot of the American male public, he set a trend for a more casual, approachable look, which many men wanted to adapt. People really wanted to emulate JFK's style and skipping the hat became a part of this look. Now, while JFK wasn't the sole reason why the hat died off, he symbolized a huge cultural shift. Hats, which once had been seen as a uniform of conformity, just didn't fit with the more relaxed vibe of the modern man. To a lot of men, Kennedy included, the hat started to seem outdated. And you had a generation who wanted to express themselves in a different way. Now, another huge cultural shift that started to happen during the mid-20th century, men started to pay more attention to their hairstyles. Men started to place much more focus on new and changing hairstyles during this time. You just saw a huge emphasis on men's hair. And of course, if you're paying so much time and attention to your hair, why would you throw a hat on top of it to mess it all up? With the rise and the emphasis of the hair and the timing effort it took to get their hairstyle, men said, why would I cover up all the effort I just put in? This is especially true as men started to use more and more hairspray and pomades on their hair. And by the time the 1970s rolled around, men were starting to wear longer hair or natural hairstyles. Think long hippie hair or the afro. Hats at this time didn't just seem unnecessary, they felt restrictive. Men wanted to use their hair to make a statement, to express themselves. And going without a hat was a great way to express this relaxed, more individual vibe. Now, another huge contributor to the decline of hats was a minor convenience and technological advance. The rise of air conditioning. Yes, I know you may not have thought of this because we're so used to air conditioning. You see, prior to the widespread use of air conditioning, men used hats as an essential to keep cool or warm depending on the season. But as indoor spaces became more climate controlled, the need for hats diminished. So because men weren't braiding the elements as much, the practicality of the hats started to take a back seat. Combined this with the rise of casual and easy to maintain clothing, the decline of the hat was predictable. Men's fashion leaned more and more into simplicity and comfort. So the hats started to seem like an extra step that just wasn't necessary. Now I wanna take some time to have a little fun and mention some iconic moments in hat wearing history. We're gonna talk about some cool, classic pop culture icons who rock hats as a signature part of their look. First of all, we gotta talk about my guy Frank Sinatra, who rocked the fedora as part of his suave cool image. Gotta love Frank. Or how about my boy MJ? Michael Jackson rocked a black fedora that became a crucial part of his stage persona. These hats remind us that wearing a signature hat was always a way to make a powerful style statement. And although hats may no longer remain as a necessity, they have retained their place in cultural history. With all that being said, it doesn't mean hats disappeared completely. As many men will attest to, myself included, hats started to become more of a fashion statement and less of a necessity in an everyday essential. Think about things such as snapbacks, beanies or bucket hats. These hats are all about adding personality and expression to your look. To have a bit of flair, not conforming to societal expectations like we did back in the day. Many men will wear a hat because they wanna make a statement and expression of style, not because it's required. That's why you'll see hats such as fedores, trubbies and other classic hat styles have made a comeback in certain circles, not worn by default. Instead, hats are often seen as a way to add a touch of inspired, vintage style to your look. And nowadays, a man rocking a hat stands out in a crowd. And over the last 20 to 30 years, we've seen some modern celebrities help bring the hat back. We're talking about some real fly stylus gentlemen that have brought the hat back into prominence by their signature wearing of them. I'm talking about celebrities like Pharrell Williams with his oversized hats. Oh, my boy David Beckham, who's been rocking flat caps for decades. Both of these fly guys show the powerful statements a hat can make. These modern icons proved when wearing a hat with confidence and with purpose, a hat can make you stand out and elevate your style. And now if you're a guy who's thinking about incorporating hats into your wardrobe, let me give you some practical tips to rocking hats today. First step to incorporating hats into your wardrobe, choose a hat that complements your face shape and your personal style. For example, a wide-brin fedora can add drama to your style while a newsboy hat keeps it simple and understated. You wanna make sure you're balancing your hat with your outfit. The formality needs to be proportional. For example, a casual newsboy hat works more with a relaxed vibe. Think leather jacket, whereas a fedora would pair better with more formal looks. Think a tailored blazer or suit. Also remember when incorporating hats into your look, confidence is a huge key. A hat is an extension of your personal style and your personality. So wear it like you mean it. So a question you might be asking, should you be one of the men that helps bring hats back? My resounding answer, an absolute yes. Especially if you feel it fits your personality and your personal style. Remember hats can be an excellent way to elevate your style and set you apart from the crowd. A well-chosen hat can add a layer of sophistication, mystery, or even a bit of swagger to any guy's outfit. But the key, like I just mentioned in the last tip, is wearing a hat with confidence. So what I often recommend to guys who are starting to wear hats, start off easy. Start with a simple flat cap or a beanie. These are some very versatile hats styles that are easy for many men to incorporate into their wardrobe. And once you get more comfortable, then you can start to experiment. Wear a trilby, a fedora. But I would take my time as I elevate to more standout hats. Because you want to remember, the goal is to elevate your look, not to make you feel uncomfortable or like you're wearing a costume. Okay, so there you have it. Why men stop wearing hats in the first place and why I believe you can be a part of bringing them back into style. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section. Are you somebody who rocks hats? Or do you feel like they're relic of the past? Now, if you enjoyed today's video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about why men stop wearing suspenders. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " Now sneakers are one of the most crucial parts of your wardrobe. They're one of the most stylish and versatile items a man can own. But if you're not careful, they can easily make or break your outfit. That's why in today's video, I'm gonna break down 10 of the worst sneaker mistakes us men often make. And more importantly, how you can avoid them. From keeping your sneakers clean to wearing the right shoes for the occasion, I've got you covered. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, rooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Braille and Bryant, salute. Now first up on the list of the 10 worst sneaker mistakes us guys often make, I wanna put you on some game. If you're not using shoe trees with your sneakers, you're making a rookie mistake. Shoe trees just aren't for your dress use. They're just as vital for your kicks as well. Over time, your sneakers can lose their shape, especially if you're rocking them on a regular basis. Shoe trees help your sneakers maintain their form, prevent creasing, and they absorb moisture to prevent odor. Especially if you use the shoe trees, I recommend cedar shoe trees. Think about it, a lot of us invest a lot of money in our shoe game. You might as well protect your investment. So when you come home from a day of wearing your sneakers, when you take them off, put shoe trees in them for at least 24 hours. Trust me, keeping your sneakers looking fresh isn't just about keeping them clean. It's just as important to keep them smelling good, prevent creasing, and keep their shape. A good pair of shoe trees will keep your sneakers looking crispy for a very long time. Now next up is a sneaker mistake I often see a lot of guys making. Wearing bulky sneakers with slim pants. Rocking chunky of bulky sneakers with your slimmer pants is definitely a no-no. You see when it comes to style, it's all about balance and proportion. Here's the deal, if you're wearing slimmer pants, it's because you're trying to create a sleeker silhouette. You're going for a streamlined look. Throwing on bulky, chunky sneakers throws that look completely out of whack. It creates a weird, unbalanced silhouette that comes off as very awkward. And what a lot of guys don't realize when you're wearing a slimmer jean or pants, bulky sneakers make your feet look way bigger. Instead of chunky, bulky sneakers, when you're wearing a slimmer pant or jeans, instead of chunky, you wanna go for a sleeker, minimal sneakers that will balance out your proportions. Now next up is the sneaker mistake you don't wanna make when you're going for a smoother, sleeker, more elevated look. You don't wanna ignore the classics. Classic sneakers like your Converse Chuck Tailors, Adidas Sambas, Adidas Stan Smiths, or even your Nike Air Force ones have stood the test of time for a reason. That's because their style is versatile and they work with a wide range of outfits in your arsenal. Whether dressing up a casual look or pairing them with a more elevated outfit, classic sneakers always deliver. And the great thing about them, you can invest a couple bucks and you'll know they'll be in style no matter what the trend. From time to time, chasing trends are cool, but flashy, over-high sneakers quickly lose their appeal. Classic sneakers on the other hand will keep you looking fresh year after year after year. So when you're building a sneaker collection, don't overlook those classic staples. They can help build the foundation of a timeless, stylish, and versatile sneaker collection. And that piggyback's nicely to the next sneaker mistake I wanna help you avoid. As you get older, don't make the mistake of not phasing out trendy sneakers. Here's the thing, as your style evolves, show us your sneaker choices. Flashy, height-driven sneakers with their wild colors and bold designs may have looked good when you were a younger man, but as you become an OG, they start to look out of place. The best bet for us OGs, we need to try to avoid trendy sneakers as often as possible, and instead transition to more clean, minimal looks. Whether we're talking about an all-white sneaker, a sneaker with a neutral tone, or a classic silhouette, these will complement an elevated, mature sneaker collection much better. Minimal sneakers are versatile, classy, and show that as you've gotten older and elevated your style, you've elevated your sneaker game as well. You have to keep in mind, as we get older, your style is gonna evolve, fellas, so should your sneakers. So as you get older, try to phase out the trendy sneakers. You'll stay modern, age-appropriate, and still very fresh. Now, next up is a sneaker mistake I have to admit I've often made myself. It can be a challenge sometimes. That's wearing worn sneakers that still look good aesthetically. Here's what I mean. If you're someone like me who tastes care of their sneakers, put the shoe trees in them and cleans them, your sneakers can still look good, even as they begin to wear down. So you're very tempted to still rock them. Problem is, as these sneakers wear down, they'll wear on you. They lose their cushioning, their support, and their structure, meaning as a result, your comfort will take a hit. Not to mention details like frayed laces or worn down soles, cheapen your look. And the other problem, worn sneakers, even though they still might look good, can actually cause pain. I'm talking about back pain, foot pain, knee pain. So even though you may have kept them sneakers clean, they're not doing your comfort or pain level any favor. So even if your sneakers still look good, if they've seen their better days, replace them. Trust me, your comfort and your style will thank you. Now, next up is a bit of a subtle sneaker mistake a lot of guys often make. You wanna make sure you're rocking sneakers that are seasonably appropriate. Here's what I mean. Just like with your clothing, certain sneakers work better as the temperature or the weather changes. During your warmer or summer months, you wanna wear lightweight breathable sneakers. Rocking the same lightweight breathable sneakers in the winter, not as good as the look. But you're on the other hand wearing heavier, bulkier insulated sneakers. Don't go with the lightweight breathable appeal you wanna have during the warmer months like the summer. You wanna make sure your sneakers match this season, both in practicality and style. So as the temperature begins to drop, you wanna offer more rugged weather resistant sneakers. The great thing about wearing the right sneakers for the right season, they keep your outfit looking cohesive, but these sneakers will also feel more comfortable in those different seasons. Now next up on the list of the 10 worst sneaker mistakes us guys tend to make, not rotating the sneakers you wear on a daily basis. Here's why this is a mistake. When you wear the same pair exclusively day after day, you're given unnecessary wear and tear on those sneakers, making them lose their shape and their freshness much faster. Even if you only own two or three pair of sneakers, rotating between each pair helps each individual pair look better and last longer for an extended period of time. Not to mention variety, elevation style game. You wanna wear the right sneakers for different vibes. Whether it's casual kicks, athletic sneakers, or something clean for date night, having different sneaker options shows you know how to dress for the part. Now I know it may be tempting to wear your favorite pair of sneakers day after day. I get it. But don't overwork your favorite pair of sneakers by not switching it up. Now this next sneaker mistake I wanna help you avoid is a bit of a general style mistake, but applies to sneakers just the same. Don't wear trendy or flashy sneakers with other statement pieces in your outfit. The reason for this is when it comes to statement pieces, even your flashy sneakers, when you wear more than one statement piece in an outfit, the eye of the person looking at you gets distracted because the thing is you really can only make one statement at a time. If your sneakers are flashy and you combine it with something else flashing your outfit, it throws the whole balance and proportion off. It creates a chaotic look. What do you wanna do instead? If you're wearing a sneaker that has a bit of a bold color or a trendier design, keep the rest of your outfit simple. Pair your bolder trendier sneakers with neutral minimal pieces throughout the rest of your outfit. That way when you're wearing your statement sneaker, let that sneaker do all the talking. If you pair your trendier sneakers with other statement pieces, it will look like you're trying too hard, which is never the move. So remember when you're wearing a bolder sneaker with more design or colors, keep the rest of your outfit simple and neutral. Now next up, I have an underrated sneaker mistake that I find guys often are making. You wanna make sure you're not neglecting your laces. Now, although it might seem like a little thing, neglecting the laces on your sneaker is a big thing to me. You know why? Because you can have the freshest, cleanest kicks, but if your laces are just as clean, it throws your whole look off. I want you to keep in mind that your laces, I like the frames for your sneakers. They pull together the whole shoe. Warn out or mismatch laces make your sneakers look tired or unkempt. Keep them clean, replace them when they're worn out and make sure you're lacing them up neatly. And also as a bonus tip, don't underestimate the value of experimenting with your laces. Different lace styles can add a fresh twist to your sneaker game. Now next up, we have another subtle sneaker mistake, but I believe if you avoid it, it can elevate your style game in a big way. You wanna make sure you're not matching your sneakers to your outfit too closely. Now matching your sneakers too perfectly with the rest of your outfit, this is a style mistake because it can make you look like you're trying too hard or your outfit looks too coordinated. What you wanna do instead when matching your sneakers to your outfit, you wanna peck a pair that compliments your look, not mimics it. For example, if the rest of your outfit is neutral minimal, pick a pair kicks to half a pop of color to them. But on the other hand, if your outfit is bold, stick with a more minimal clean sneaker look. When you have a bit of subtle contrast, it creates outfit harmony. A little intentional mismatching when it comes to your sneakers and your outfit shows effortless and confident style. Here's the thing, when it comes to matching your sneakers to the rest of your outfit, don't overthink it. Just keep it cool, balanced, fresh and grown. Okay, so there you have it. 10 of the worst sneaker mistakes us men often make and how you can avoid them. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section some common sneaker mistakes you see guys making that I forgot to mention in today's video. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the best affordable white sneakers men can grab. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " It's time to get into the 10 essential things every man must do before a date to ensure it goes smoothly and you leave a lasting impression. Now whether you're on your first date or the 50th, preparation is the key to make sure you show confidence, respect, and thoughtfulness. That's why in today's video I'm going to break down everything you need to do in detail that will make sure you show up as your best self and create a memorable experience for both you and your date. So if you want to feel confident, avoid comment pitfalls, and impress that special someone, take a round. And if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Brendan Reed, salute. First up on the list of the 10 things you must do before that date, please make sure you plan ahead. Now planning ahead is crucial because it shows thoughtfulness, organization, and respect for your date's time and comfort. When you take the time to choose the venue, activity, and a time that suits both parties, it shows that you value the experience and you're genuinely invested. Proper planning also helps ensure the date goes smoothly, reducing the chance for awkward moments and unnecessary stress. And I love that planning ahead helps you tailor the outing to shared interests, allowing you to create a memorable and enjoyable connection. Being prepared by doing things such as making reservations and knowing your route to the venue reflects confidence and reliability. Take it from me, a woman appreciates a man who's thoughtful and puts in effort. This shows that you're decisive and your proactive qualities women absolutely love. Making thoughtful plans is a key to an enjoyable and memorable date. Now next up is another absolutely crucial step in preparing for that date. Please make sure you groom and clean yourself up well. Now I know this may seem like common sense, but I don't want you to underestimate how essential this is in showing respect, not only for your date, but for yourself. First impressions really matter and good hygiene demonstrates you made an effort and you care about presenting the best version of you. Taking a shower, trimming your facial hair, cleaning and trimming your nails can also boost your confidence, helping you be more self assured and relaxed on the date. Not to mention, well maintained grooming and hygiene highlights and attention to detail, a quality many women find very appealing. Also that proper grooming sets a tone for the date, creating a positive and welcoming impression. Ultimately proper grooming reflects thoughtfulness and can make your date feel more comfortable and appreciated. Speaking of your grooming and hygiene, that takes us to our next step in your preparation. Please make sure you're checking your breath. Checking your breath is an essential part of your personal hygiene because it can significantly impact your date's impression of you. You see bad breath can be off putting and distracting from an otherwise enjoyable time. And I mean no matter how well the conversation or the connection is going. Simple steps like brushing your teeth, using mouth wise, chewing sugar free gum or using a tongue scraper ensures that your breath stays fresh throughout the evening. And here's an extra step to help you with your breath. If you're eating, be mindful of things like garlic and onion which can linger. Showing you care about small details like your breath reflects thoughtfulness and respect. And it helps create a pleasant and confident atmosphere throughout the day. Part of making sure your breath stays fresh, please make sure you're making your dental appointments. There's some things brushing and flossing won't take care of. So look fellas, you come to this channel to elevate your style and your game. But sometimes we forget the basics. Like say for example, when was the last time you went to the dentist? If it's been over two years, I highly recommend you stop everything you're doing right now and head over to today's video sponsor, ZopDot. Because two years, that's way too long. And I get it. I might go extended periods of time between my dental appointments. But true story, recently my wife had to strongly encourage me to get back to the dentist. And because I had put it off for so long, it wasn't pretty. I don't want that to happen to you. Because trust me, when your breath is kicking, you're not going to get a second date or any day for that matter. Nobody wants to lean in to smell last week's leftover. That's why I'm so excited to introduce you to my friends over at ZopDot. Where you can search for and compare high quality in-network doctors, including dentists. All you have to do is go to ZopDot.com slash the style OG, pick the right dentist for you, and book an appointment immediately. It's so easy. Going on the days I'll call them around and waiting for months for someone to see you. And with ZopDot, you don't even have to talk to someone on the phone. You can book an appointment with just a few clicks. You can even filter for dentists that take your insurance, are located nearby, and are highly rated by verified patients. Plus you can see appointment openings right there on your screen and pick a time that works best for you. And ZopDot appointments happen super fast, typically within 24 to 72 hours. So stop putting off those dental appointments, fellas. Let's get you in your breath right for that next day. I personally use ZopDot in the past several times and I couldn't be more satisfied. So make sure you go over to ZopDot.com slash the style OG and book your dental appointment today. Now the next step in preparing for that date shouldn't surprise you since this is a style channel. Please make sure you dress for the occasion. Now this is important not only to look good, but it also shows thoughtfulness, respect, and that you've made an effort. The right attire shows that you value your date and you've considered the setting. Whether we're talking about a coffee date, a fancy dinner, or an outdoor activity. And I also love that dressing well for that date can boost your confidence, making sure you feel comfortable and you look your best. You see the thing is underdressing or overdressing for the date can make you feel uncomfortable and awkward. But tailoring your outfit to the occasion helps set the right tone. What you want to do is pay attention to the fit of your clothing, the cleanliness, and your accessories that you choose. This will further enhance your appearance. So here's what I really want you to do. You don't need to wear suits and ties or get as dressed up as I may. What I want you to do is if you usually dress at a five level, take it up to a seven. If you usually dress at a seven, take it up to an eight or nine. That'll do. Next up is one of my favorite tips when it comes to getting ready for that date. Prepare some conversation topics ahead of time. Now this is highly effective because it helps you engage in meaningful dialogue and reduces the likelihood of awkward silences. Having some fun topics in mind, such as hobbies, travel, or shared interests, makes the conversation flow naturally and more comfortably. But on the other hand, I highly recommend, especially early on in the dating process, avoiding overly personal or controversial topics. Remember you're on a date, not at a debate. Avoiding these topics also helps you demonstrate emotional intelligence and respect. And one of the reasons why I highly recommend preparing conversation topics ahead of time, it helps relax you, take some of the nerve away. And this will boost your confidence and allow you to concentrate on connecting with your date, not coming up with things to say. Now one of the easiest things you can do to get ready for that date, I recommend you practice good posture. Now this is a great thing to do because it helps you exude confidence, attentiveness, and self-assuredness. All qualities women find very attractive. By practicing things such as standing and sitting upright, having your shoulders back, chest slightly open, it helps you create a positive and welcoming presence. Not to mention good posture also improves your body language. It makes you appear more interested and engaged in your date. And another great thing I love about practicing good posture, it helps enhance your physical appearance by creating a taller and more poised silhouette. And the reason why I want you to practice good posture, you're much more likely to maintain it throughout the date, even which is likely to happen when your nerves kick in. Having good posture reflects confidence and respect, both for yourself and your date. Making it much more likely that you're going to create a positive and memorable impression. Next up is a step I absolutely want to make sure you don't miss. Make sure you have financial readiness. Now ensuring financial readiness is key because it demonstrates preparedness, consideration, and responsibility. And I don't care whether you're treating your date or splitting the cost. Making sure you're financially ready helps avoid awkward moments and make sure the date flows much more smoothly. Trust me, I don't want to happen to you what happened to me back in the day. Time for a little story time with Uncle Jeff. We're going to rewind back maybe 15, 20 years ago when I first started making a bit of money. I had a nice date planned up in New York. Only problem is I wasn't aware of how much that might cost. Once I started driving, gasped up the car, came across those tows, paid $50 for parking, and went to this nice steak restaurant for the first time when I didn't check the menu prices. Trust me, as the cost started adding up and adding up, I started sweating more and more. It got so bad that I had to be honest with my date and say, look, I might run out of money before we finish this date. Thankfully, she understood and we figured it out. But that was super awkward and embarrassing. Please don't let this happen to you. By making sure you have financial readiness, it ensures a more smooth, comfortable, and stress-free date. Now, next up is to me one of the most underrated aspects of preparing for a date. I want you to make sure you're well rested. Now, being well rested is essential because it helps you bring your best energy, focus, and attitude to the date. Adequate rest improves your mood, sharpens your mind, and helps you stay engaged in conversation. Whereas fatigue on the other hand can lead to irritability, a lack of concentration, and enthusiasm, all things that can sour the date. Rested individuals also exude confidence and vitality, leading to a positive impression. Not to mention looking refreshed enhances your overall appearance and signals that you've taken the time to prepare for the date thoughtfully. Ultimately, being well rested shows respect for your date and helps create a pleasant, relaxed, and comfortable dating experience. Now, next up is to me one of the best recommendations you'll see throughout this video. I stand by this one. You want to make sure you set your mindset. Now, setting your mindset is a positive thing to do before that date because it allows you to approach the experience with positivity, openness, and confidence. By having a clear and intentional mindset, it allows you to focus on enjoying the date instead of overthinking or letting your nerves get the best of you. I want you to remind yourself to be present, listen actively, and engage in the conversation with authenticity. And one of the most important things about setting your mindset, please set realistic expectations of the date. This helps you reduce any pressure and allow you to engage in the date in a natural and organic way. Not to mention a positive mindset helps you project self-assurance and makes you appear more comfortable and approachable. And I also love the idea of setting your mindset because it makes you prepared and able to handle any unexpected occurrences. It allows you to handle them with grace and demonstrate maturity. Now, next up is what might be a bit of a common sense tip when it comes to preparing for a date, but I think it bears mentioning anyway. Please, my brother, be on time. Now, being on time is crucial because it demonstrates respect, reliability, and a consideration for your date's time. Punctuality sets a positive tone, and it shows her that you value the time and effort she's put in to meeting you. And one of the things I love about arriving on time, it reduces any unnecessary stress and allows the date to start off smoothly and comfortably. Arriving late on the other hand, this creates a negative first impression and can easily lead to your date feeling frustrated, undervalued, and disrespected. By planning ahead and leaving a bit early to anticipate any delays, you display maturity and responsibility. Look, I get it. Oftentimes, the woman may be late. But here on this channel, we believe there's differences between men and women. Women are allowed to be fashionably late. This is a style channel. You being late is a stylish for the man. You being on time sets the foundation for a pleasant, respectful, and enjoyable dating experience. Okay, so there you have it. 10 things every guy should do before that date. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comment section any preparation you believe the astrology family should make before that date that I might have forgotten to mention.

        "transcript": " So let me ask you a question. When was the last time you wore suspenders? Or for that matter, even thought about wearing them. Yep, that's what I thought. Suspenders used to be the go-to accessory for men. Practical, stylish, and absolutely essential. But nowadays, belts run the game. And suspenders have been regulated to weddings in the red carpet. So how and why did this happen? Why did men stop wearing suspenders? That's what we're going to break down in today's video. We're going to figure out why suspenders got pushed to the back seat.

Suspenders, or braces as they were referred to back in the day, date all the way back to the 18th century. Now you see around this time, the pants that men wore tended to sit higher up on the waist. Much higher on the waist than the pants that we typically wear nowadays. And the higher the pants sit up on your waist, best become less and less of a practical choice. And because of that reason, suspenders stepped up as a solution. Because suspenders are designed to sit over your shoulders and hold your trousers in place, suspenders do the job much better on higher waisted pants than belts ever could. And by the 1820, suspenders have become the standard for keeping your pants up. And high quality suspenders made by brands such as Albert Thurston were seen as signs of sophistication and class. But back then, suspenders were meant to be worn and not seen. They were typically worn under a waistcoat or a jacket. And so for the 18th, 19th, and the beginning of the 20th century, suspenders were holding it down. But things started to shift in the mid to late 20th century. Why did this happen? Now belts started to gain popularity in the 1920s and 30s as more pants were designed with belt loops on them. And besides that, trousers were starting to be designed to sit lower on the waist, which then in turn made belts a much better option to hold up your pants than suspenders. Or so people thought. Belts were simpler, easier to use and seen as much more modern than suspenders. Around this time, if you wanted to stay on trend, you reached for a belt, not suspenders. And then came World War II. During the war, practicality became king. Belts became a standard in military uniforms. And when the soldiers returned home, they brought that habit with them. And a lot of men's style is derived from military designs and uses. So due to practicality and changing trends, belts are to become more of the standard. Now belts were the first nail in the coffin. The 1960s and 70s were the knockout punch for suspenders. You see, this was the era of youth rebellion. And guys wanted to move away from anything that seemed old school or traditional. And suspenders were seen as every bit of that. You see, guys during this time started wearing more casual clothing. Think about your jeans, your t-shirts and overall more casual styles just started to take over. So therefore, belts were seen as much more appropriate for this more casual, rebellious look. Belts fit into this vibe much better than suspenders did. You see, suspenders just started to be seen as old-fashioned. Too stuffy or too formal. And let's keep it real. Guys around this time didn't want to be seen as having the same style as their dad or their granddad. So to many guys during this time, suspenders started to be seen as something as your grandfather wore or something you saw in old school photos. And they definitely weren't seen as the accessory for the modern man. So with the rebellious spirit of the 1950s through the 70s and the push towards more casual wear, suspenders took even more of a backseat to belts. But I don't want you to get it twisted. Suspenders didn't disappear completely from the scene. They stuck around in some interesting way. A lot of times, especially from the 70s, 80s and 90s, you would see suspenders as signs of pop culture. You would see pop culture references and uses of suspenders in movies like Wall Street, worn by Gordon Gekko. Michael Douglas' character wore suspenders as a sign of authority and power. Not to mention you had guys like Larry King who wore suspenders as a personal statement. And on the other hand, suspenders stayed very popular in specific professions, especially for blue collar workers. Suspenders were a practical and reliable option to give you support and keep your pants up during heavy duty tasks. You see the great thing about suspenders for blue collar work, they distribute you weight evenly, ensuring comfort during long hours of physical labor. And another great thing about suspenders when it comes to my blue collar fellas, they prevent bunching around the waist. Suspenders don't slip or constrict around the waist like a belt when you're carrying tools or bending over frequently. You see the great thing about suspenders? Functionality is never out of style. Now let's fast forward to today. Suspenders are having a bit of a comeback, but in a different way. Suspenders have found a new home in formal wear and vintage inspired outfits. Think about situations like weddings, three-piece suits, or hipster inspired looks. The great thing about a lot of dressier clothing, suits, suspenders, dress shoes, as men as a whole dress more casually, guys start to wear more formal things as a choice, not a requirement, including suspenders. Oftentimes if you are rocking suspenders, you're doing it to stand out, not blend in. But here's the great thing about suspenders. When worn right, they can actually elevate your style. The great thing about suspenders, they're sharp, they're classy, and they show that you're a man who pays attention to details. However, if you're going to wear suspenders by choice, please by all means, don't wear the clip on ones. Go for suspenders with buttons. It's all about authenticity. Now being that this is a style channel, I actually want to talk to you about why suspenders actually give you a step up in style when compared to belts. The reason why I'm a fan of suspenders, and I believe you should be too. Suspenders are just not functional, they actually can elevate your style. Now one of the things that make suspenders a great choice, unlike belts, suspenders keep your pants sitting at your natural waist much more easily, which not only looks better, it's more comfortable. Another great thing about suspenders, when you're rocking them, they elongate your frame, making you appear taller and slimmer. So not only do they have old school charm, they actually make you look better. Oftentimes when I give style tips to my big guys, suspenders are one of my top recommendations. Because suspenders distribute your weight much more evenly than belts, this helps prevent your jeans or pants from bunching or sagging. A great solution for my big guys. Of course, as I just said, suspenders elongate you and make you look slimmer. Another key reason why my big guys should wear them. And on top of that, unlike belts, they don't dig and sense your waist, and they don't emphasize your midsection. Suspenders allow your pants to drape naturally and cleaner, giving you a much more polished silhouette. Now, in addition to my bigger guys, guess who else suspenders work wonders for? My vertically challenged fellas. Yes, suspenders are a great option for shorter guys. Now, just as I mentioned a couple of times that suspenders can elongate your frame and make you look taller, in addition to that, as opposed to belts, suspenders don't cut you in half. The reason why I often advise short guys not wear belts, and to make sure as often as possible that pants fit well without wearing a belt, is that wearing a belt cuts your body in half. When shorter guys cut their bodies in half with a belt, it makes them look even shorter. That's why even though I'm 5'10\", average height, I often will go for suspenders over a belt. It gives you a taller and more flattering silhouette. Okay, fellas, so there's my breakdown of why suspenders went out of style and why I think they should come back. From changing trends to the rise of belts, suspenders took a back seat. But here's the thing, suspenders never went out of style for the sharp dressed man in the know. Suspenders bring time to sophistication, functionality, and a unique flair that belts could never match. So whether you're rocking a classic suit or looking to elevate your casual game, don't ever sleep on suspenders. Okay, so now I want to hear from you. Let me know your thoughts about suspenders. Do you rock them over belts? Or do you believe suspenders are an old school accessory that need to stay in the past? Let me know.

        "transcript": " Let's talk about something that's critical for your energy, confidence, and your overall manliness, that testosterone. Your T-Levels can impact everything from building muscle, maintaining your focus, and keeping the spark alive in your relationship. However, unfortunately, as we age, our testosterone levels can start to drop. Don't you worry, I've got you back. On today's video, I'm going to share with you 11 natural and easy ways you can boost your testosterone levels and take your energy and your health to the next level. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Adrian Tate, salute. Now first up on our list of 11 easy ways you can boost your testosterone is something a lot of us love, but we don't always prioritize. Sleep. Now fellas, if you're not getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep, you're short changing your testosterone. That's because why you're asleep, that's when most of your testosterone is produced. So if you're staying up late night scrolling on your telephone and not getting quality hours of sleep, you're doing yourself no favors. You need to think of sleep as your body's reset button. Why you're asleep is when your body gets a chance to repair and recover. And part of that is hormone production and hormone balance. If you're not getting enough sleep, it results in lower testosterone production. A huge problem. So what I need you to do is prioritize quality nights of sleep like you might prioritize hitting the gym or eating well. Trust me, your testosterone levels will thank you. Speaking of hitting the gym, that brings us to our next simple but powerful way of boosting your testosterone levels. Make sure you're engaging in regular exercise, but specifically weight training and HIIT training. Yes, you need to exercise, but specifically for your testosterone levels, strength and HIIT training is paramount. Lifting weights with compound movements like deadlifts or squats that target large muscle groups. Signature your body while you're recovering from hitting the gym that it needs to increase the testosterone. And when you couple strength training with HIIT training, which is high intensity interval training, where you do short bursts of intense exercise followed by short periods of rest, this effectively boosts your testosterone levels by promoting fat loss. And stimulating the release of anabolic hormones. So if you want to boost your testosterone, hit and look better, hit the weights and do some HIIT training. Now of course, normally when you're talking about exercise, when it comes to improving your health, you pair it with this next tip. Yes, you can improve your testosterone levels by maintaining a healthy diet. Because when it comes to your testosterone levels, what you put in your body matters. Maintaining a balanced diet, rich in healthy fats, lean proteins and the right carbs is key to keeping your testosterone levels where they're supposed to be. Foods like avocados, nuts, olive oils and fatty fish are packed with good fats that support testosterone production. But also don't forget zinc rich foods like oysters and spinach because zinc plays a key role in hormone production. You are supporting testosterone production by providing your body with essential nutrients to produce hormones. In addition, a balanced diet which helps regulate blood sugar reduces the release of cortisol which suppresses testosterone. So if you want to maintain your testosterone levels where they're supposed to be, make sure you maintain a balanced healthy diet. Now when you tie the last two tips together of regular strength training and HIIT training with a healthy diet, you get this next benefit. You'll lose excess fat. Losing excess body fat is a great way to increase your testosterone production because excess fat actually stimulates your body to produce more estrogen, the opposite of what you want. What actually happens when you're carrying around excess body fat, your body will convert testosterone to estrogen, something we definitely don't want. By losing excess fat, not only do you increase testosterone production, you also improve your body's insulin sensitivity, which will reduce inflammation and stress on your body, which can be testosterone suppressors. Setting your body weight enhances your energy level, promotes a more active lifestyle, which then creates a positive cycle that improves your overall health and your hormonal balance, including those T levels. Now next step on the list of 11 easy and natural ways to boost your testosterone levels, we need to talk about reducing stress. You've got to reduce your stress if you want to increase your T levels because chronic stress is no doubt a testosterone killer. That's because when you have an increase in your stress levels, you have an increase in the release of the hormone cortisol. When cortisol goes up, your testosterone levels go down. You see chronic stress creates hormonal imbalance, which leads to diminished energy and lower physical performance. So to reduce your stress levels, you want to engage in practices like meditation, yoga, exercise, and adequate rest, all which can help regulate your hormonal production. When you're managing your stress effectively, you're increasing your testosterone production. Not to mention reduced stress also helps improve your sleep quality. Remember when we first started the video, we talked about just how important sleep quality is when it comes to your testosterone. Managing stress improves your overall health and promotes an environment of optimal testosterone production. Now next up is something I know a lot of us don't think about when it comes to our health, but it can impact your T levels. You want to make sure you're getting enough vitamin D. Now vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin, and it plays a crucial role in testosterone production. You see vitamin is synthesized when you have exposure to the sun on your skin. Vitamin D not only plays a role in testosterone production, but overall hormone production. So of course my introverts and my recluses, you're gonna have to get outside of your house and get some sun exposure. Vitamin D not only helps with testosterone production, it helps regulate calcium and phosphate, which are essential in your body for healthy bones and muscle. Be more healthy overall and increase your hormonal and testosterone production. Get outside, get some exposure to the sun, and get the right amounts of vitamin D. Now I know this next one for some guys is gonna sting a little bit. If you want to increase your testosterone levels, you might have to cut down on some of the alcohol. Yes, too much alcohol consumption can wreck your testosterone levels. Here's the thing. Excess alcohol has a negative impact on hormonal production, including of course what we're talking about today, your T levels. And one type of alcohol consumption in particular. I'm talking about beer. You might not realize this, but excess beer consumption actually increases estrogen production, and it can easily inhibit your body's ability to produce testosterone. Not to mention excess alcohol consumption affects your sleep quality. We talked about the importance of sleep quality when it comes to your T levels. And of course, when you drink a whole lot, you might gain some excess weight, and you gotta remember a couple steps back, too much fat, less testosterone. Now I'm not saying you can't drink at all, but you have to drink in moderation. Chronic alcohol consumption can actually damage your liver, which is responsible for hormone metabolism in your body. Limiting your alcohol consumption not only helps your overall health, it helps your reproductive health. Now earlier we talked about the importance of hitting the gym, lifting those weights, and doing your head training. But just as important, you have to stay active throughout the day. Yes, being too sedentary can affect your T levels. You see throughout the day, sitting for long periods of time actually inhibits testosterone production. Staying active actually boosts testosterone levels by engaging metabolism and reducing your body fat. Regular movement throughout the day like walking, stretching, or light activity also improves your blood flow, supports energy level, and boosts the release of endorphins that can help reduce stress and increase your T levels. Staying active also enhances your insulin sensitivity, which helps promote hormonal balance. Combined with resistance and HIIT training, staying active throughout the day creates a healthy environment for testosterone production. Speaking of staying active, this next one I know you're gonna like. You can increase your testosterone levels by staying sexually active. It's a win-win for everybody because when you remain sexually active, it stimulates testosterone production by keeping you physically and emotionally engaged. Regular sexual activity activates the release of hormones like oxytocin and dopamine, which reduce stress levels and promote overall well-being. Regular sexual activity actually increases your blood flow, improves your mood, and increases your energy, all which are linked to great hormonal balance. Furthermore, testosterone plays a level in your libido or your sex drive. And maintaining a healthy sex life just creates this positive cycle. More sex, more testosterone production. More testosterone production, the more sex you wanna have. So if you need another reason to have a healthy sex life, it can increase your T levels. Now for our next tip on 11 easy ways to boost your testosterone, I wanna get scientific for a minute. You can do it by avoiding endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals found in things like plastics, pesticides, and even some grooming products that can disrupt your hormonal balance. Avoiding endocrine disruptors helps boost your testosterone levels by protecting your body's natural hormone regulation. Chemicals like BPA, phthalates, and pesticides can mimic estrogen or block testosterone production. As we mentioned earlier, both of those things are not what we want. So when you reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors by using glass or stainless steel containers or opting for natural grooming products, it helps in you safeguarding your body's endocrine system. Protecting your hormonal health helps increase energy, increase T levels, and promotes overall physical and reproductive well-being. Now next up is something to consider to boost your testosterone levels, especially for a lot of us nowadays who don't get all unnecessary nutrients from our diet. You might want to consider supplementing wisely. When I'm talking about supplementation, I'm speaking about a couple things in particular. Zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium can both help with testosterone synthesis and muscle recovery. You also might want to consider some vitamin D supplementation, especially for my guys who don't get enough exposure to the sun. Remember earlier in the video, we talked about how important vitamin D is in testosterone levels. Another supplement you might want to consider, osmogonda, which can help reduce stress and cortisol, promoting hormonal balance that prioritizes T levels. You might also want to consider omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil, which can support your overall health and hormonal function. However, word to the wise, before you start taking any supplement, consult your doctor to make sure you're taking things that support your needs and don't disrupt your lifestyle. And to make sure the supplements you're taking are safe for you. Okay, so there you have it. 11 easy ways to boost your testosterone. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section anything you've tried on this list that you've seen great results when it comes to your T levels. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about 11 things only mature men do. You can check it out right here."

Options like beanies, wool caps, or trapper hats are practical yet versatile choices that compliment a wide range of outfits from casual to formal in everything in between. In addition to functionality, the right winter hat adds character to your winter looks, allowing for personal expression through texture, colors, and different styles. Whether you're braving snow or just looking to elevate your winter aesthetic, a winter hat is a must have accessory for staying stylish and warm throughout the season. Now naturally after talking about winter hats, it's time to talk about this next accessory. We all need some winter gloves. Now winter gloves are crucial during the winter because they protect against cold weather while adding a finishing touch to your winter fits. Keep your hands warm as vital for comfort and for preventing dryness and cracking that can be caused by colder temps. High quality gloves such as leather or wool options provide insulation and durability, giving you long term use. Stylish gloves can also enhance your winter looks, complimenting different outfits from a casual jacket to a formal overcoat. What I also like to look for in our modern days is touchscreen compatible gloves, which combine functionality and convenience, allowing you to use your smartphone and other gadgets while not exposing your hands to those brisk winter winds. Whether for practicality or style, winter gloves are an indispensable accessory every guy needs and it's been to wardrobe. Now next up I have a great alternative to hats for my guys out there who are worried about yes I want to keep my ears warm but I want to mess up my hairstyle. For you I recommend ear warmers. Ear warmers are a great winter style accessory because they provide targeted protection against the cold. Because our ears are particularly sensitive to low temps, ear warmers come through in the clutch, helping you to retain heat, prevent discomfort or frostbite, all at the same time protecting that precious hairdo. Not to mention ear warmers are compact and lightweight, making them a great choice when you're on the go. Available in various materials like fleece, wool, or knitted designs, ear warmers suit both casual and sporty looks just the same. Whether you're commuting, hiking, or enjoying outdoor activities, you gotta keep those precious ears warm. And ear warmers do it in a way that combines practicality with understated style. Now next up without a doubt is one of the most forgotten winter style accessories a lot of guys tend to overlook. Yes the colder temperatures are arrived but you still need quality sunglasses. Quality sunglasses are winter style essential because they protect your eyes and enhance any winter fit. You see in the winter the sun is at a lower point in the sky, easily causing harsh glare, especially when the sun is reflecting off of snow and ice. So it's natural with that harsh glare, a quality pair of sunglasses definitely needed. Polarized sunglasses reduce this glare, increase visibility, and reduce eye strain. And they also protect your eyes from harmful UV rays which are present all through the year. Beyond functionality of course the right pair of sunglasses adds a bit of sophistication and style to any winter look. I'm talking about anywhere from your most rugged casual looks to formal looks as well. Whether you're skiing, driving, or walking in bright conditions, quality sunglasses are must have because of how they effortlessly combine practicality with timeless style. Next up is what I believe is a highly underrated accessory when it comes to winter style. We all need a stylish and sturdy umbrella. Now stylish and sturdy umbrella is a winter essential because it provides protection against wind, rain, and snow. All at the same time enhancing your overall look. Winter weather often brings unpredictable storms and a high quality umbrella keeps you dry and comfortable especially while you're on the go. Not to mention a well designed umbrella adds a sophisticated touch to your winter looks. Complimenting formal coats and casual jackets just the same. When grabbing that winter umbrella you want to look for features such as wind resistant frames, a durable canopy, and a sleek handle. The right umbrella combines functionality and style at the same time. Whether you're headed to work or for a casual outing, the right stylish sturdy umbrella ensures you stay polished and protected throughout the winter. Now next up on the list of the 10 winter style accessories every guy needs is something you'll be glad to remember the next time you head out on that very cold winter day. You want to make sure you have thermal undergarments. Now thermal undergarments are a crucial part of your winter wardrobe because they provide comfort and warmth without adding extra bulk to your winter style. Made from moisture wicking and insulating materials, thermal tops and bottoms help trap in your body heat while drawing moisture away from your skin preventing chills and discomfort. And the great thing about thermal undergarments they allow for comfortable layering providing extra warmth without sacrificing a bit of style. Whether you're braving the cold or simply navigating chilly indoor environments, thermal undergarments provide a practical and versatile solution. They fit snugly under your winter clothing providing a versatile yet invisible layer. A great way to stay warm, comfortable and stylish throughout the winter months. Next up on the list we're going to talk about a category you should wear year round but you need specific kinds for the winter. You want to make sure you have a winter cologne. A winter cologne is a definite essential because it adds a touch of sophistication and individuality to your winter looks. Wearing the cold the months you want to select fragrances that are a bit heavier. Think ones with no such as spices, woods or leather. These are all perfect when grabbing a signature winter scent. A well chosen winter fragrance easily enhances your present. Make you stand out in a way that's not overpowering but still very noticeable. In addition to the aromatic appeal of a winter cologne it can help boost your confidence and leave a lasting impression. Whether you're headed to a holiday party or just navigating the chilly weather a winter cologne ties together your style with a bit of refinement.

In today's video, we're going to dive into the qualities that set older men apart and why many women are drawn to us.

On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, rooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Gray Ryder, salute. Now, first up on the list of the 11 traits that make older men very appealing to women, stability. Now, stability is a great trait to have that's often seen in older guys because it provides a foundation for a strong and fulfilling relationship. You see an older guy is typically established with his finances, career, and his personal life, which reduces the uncertainty that's often seen in younger guys. And this sense of stability translates into emotional consistency, better decision making, and a dependable presence within the relationship. Women often value a partner who can provide reassurance and security in a long-term relationship. And an older man's life experience and maturity takes them out of the phase of experimentation oftentimes. It tends to be more focused on commitment and shared goals, qualities that women find very appealing. And one of the main reasons why women are often drawn to older men, that sense of stability, which piggybacks very nicely into this next quality, women often find very appealing in older guys. We have life experience. Now, the reason why this is an appealing trait is because it often brings wisdom, perspective, and some depth to the relationship. You see older guys have typically already had to face life's challenges and overcome them. And this gives them the ability to navigate life's complexities with composure and confidence. And this life experience often translates into better decision making, emotional stability, and practical knowledge, all of which can enrich conversations and connections. You see women often value men who can offer guidance, share insight, and often inspire personal growth. Life experience gives you the ability to do that. Life experience also often means an older guy is self-assured and less likely to engage in drama, making them the ideal partner for a woman who's seeking stability, maturity, and a fulfilling long-term relationship. And life experience often contributes to this next quality found in older guys that women love. Older guys tend to have maturity. Maturity is a very appealing trait because it often brings with it emotional consistency, wisdom, and a deeper understanding on how relationships work. Older men who have maturity are often better managing emotions, handling conflicts, and communicating effectively, all which help build better relationships. And the life experience that leads to maturity brings to an older guy perspective and patience and the ability to prioritize what truly matters in life, making an older guy much more dependable because he's less likely to engage in impulsive behavior. Maturity also fosters self-assurance and confidence. Two qualities women find very appealing. Older men's ability to navigate life's challenges with composure and grace and provide guidance, all traits that are developed by having maturity, is very appealing to the opposite sex. Another thing women definitely love about older guys, we often have a refined sense of style. Now this refined sense of style seen in older guys reflects sophistication, attention to detail, and self-confidence. You see the older guy, he's not concerned with trends. He has a better understanding of what fits his personal style, his body type, and he will choose well-fitting, timeless pieces. And this polished sense of style enhances the older guy's overall appearance, and it projects maturity, making him stand out in a crowd. An older man with a refined sense of style projects self-respect and confidence. Two traits that women find very appealing. Whether it's a tailored suit, classic outerwear, or a timeless pair of shoes, thoughtfully curated wardrobe is something that older men have had the time to develop over years, and it adds to his overall charm and charisma, making him very appealing to the ladies. Now one of the best character traits that's often seen in older guys that the women absolutely love, he typically has strong values. Now this is a great thing because it helps him demonstrate integrity, purpose, and emotional stability. You see an older man has had time to reflect on his beliefs and his priorities, and he knows who he is and what he stands for. And this consistency creates trust and respect. Two qualities that are very important in building a healthy relationship. Strong values also indicate a focus on meaningful goals, like building a family, personal growth, or contributing to a greater purpose. All qualities that women find very attractive. By aligning their actions with their beliefs, older men demonstrate authenticity and confidence. Because he's had time to figure out who he is and what's important to him, this gives him sincerity, depth, and makes him often have long-term compatibility for women seeking these qualities. So as the older man gets mature and has life experience, he develops strong values. And the older guy who has strong values often has this next very appealing trait. He tends to be family oriented. Now women find family oriented guys very attractive because it tends to reflect stability, responsibility, and a commitment to long-term values. Older men with their life experience tend to prioritize family and long lasting relationships as a whole. They see them as a source of connection and fulfillment. Not to mention the older guy who prioritizes family, he tends to make a reliable and nurturing partner, especially for women who are seeking the same long-term commitment. This leads to a man who wants to build a strong and supportive home. You see the older guy who has family values will very easily align with the woman who's seeking the same, who perhaps want to raise children and build a loving and supportive home. Not to mention the family oriented man tends to be more emotionally mature, understanding, and committed to ensuring the well-being of his loved one, which instantly adds to the older guy's overall appeal. Older guy also has typically developed emotional intelligence. Now this is a very appealing trait because often fosters understanding, empathy, and it helps build strong communication skills. You see the older guy through his life experience is more likely to recognize and manage emotions, both his and that of his partners, very effectively. And this helps create a supportive and harmonious relationship. You see the older guy with his emotional intelligence tends to listen attentively, handle conflict constructively, and he has the ability to validate his woman's feelings, making her feel heard and appreciated. And this emotional intelligence often reflects maturity, patience, and the ability to navigate life's complexities with grace. And these qualities help build greater emotional connections, intimacy, and trust. Women appreciate a man who can approach a relationship with thoughtfulness, empathy, and skill communications, all things that come along with emotional intelligence. Now next up we have a bit of a chicken or the egg situation. Did our last trait, emotional intelligence, lead to this one? Or does this trait lead to emotional intelligence? Either way, it's a very appealing characteristic. The ability to communicate effectively. Older men who typically have better communication skills draw women in because it fosters understanding and a deeper connection in relationships. Older men through their experience have learned to express themselves clearly, listen attentively, and respond effectively. You see the man with better communication skills, he doesn't react, he responds. When a man responds, he assesses the situations, thinks about it, then he makes a decision. Instead of just spouting off at the mouth the minute he hears something. And this ability to communicate effectively creates an environment of trust and openness. You see the older guy with better communication skills, it's much more likely to handle conflicts calmly and constructively. Because he prioritizes resolution over the emotional outbursts. Women value a man who can engage in meaningful conversations and navigate complex emotions. Abilities that are developed with better communication skills. Another very appealing trait often seen in older guys, they tend to have more patience. And this patience is reflected in emotional stability and he tends to have a calm and steady presence within a relationship. You see the older guy with age and experience learn the value of taking his time and allowing things to occur naturally. You see the older guy with this patience is less likely to rush into a decision or become easily frustrated. And this makes the older guy much more understanding and supportive partner as a result. And this patience fosters a sense of security and calm, allowing the woman to feel respected, heard and valued. Whether it's taking the time to listen or giving space during challenging situations, an older man's patience creates a balanced and thoughtful dynamic within a relationship. In this creation environment that women find very appealing. Another hugely important skill that older men have tend to develop, they now have the ability to offer mentorship and guidance. Now this is a very appealing trait to women because it allows the older guy to offer support, wisdom and a sense of direction. You see the older guy who's accumulated through life experience, the ability to help guide others through challenges and big decisions. This ability to provide practical knowledge, share insights, makes the older guy dependable and inspiring partner. And the thing about the older guy, his mentorship and guidance isn't controlled. It's about offering thoughtful perspectives and helping your partner reach her full potential. This nurturing quality rooted in experience is very attractive, especially to a woman both seeking companionship and personal growth. Now next up is a trait women find appealing no matter what the age of the man. But it's had plenty of time to develop and us older fellas. Women love an older guy with confidence. Now confidence is very attractive to women because it often reflects self-assurance, maturity and a strong sense of identity. You see the older guy who has developed confidence often has a strong sense of who they are and what they want. And this will often eliminate the need for validation from others in an older guy's life. And this calm, grounded presence that's developed through confidence makes a man more approachable and magnetic to women. You see women are naturally drawn to men who project security and composure. You see confident men handle conflict and challenge gracefully, take initiative in relationships and easily build trust. Unlike arrogance, true confidence comes through humility and respect. Qualities that deepen emotional connections and make the older guy very appealing to the opposite sex. Okay so there you have it. 11 of the top reasons women love older men.

Now whether we're talking about timeless classics like a wool overcoat or the pea coat or more practical choices like a Parker or a puffer jacket, I will break down all the essential winter coat styles that will have you looking sharp and staying warm throughout the colder months. And to help you out even more, in the description for every coat style we're talking about, I'm going to have links to different price point choices so you can ramp up your wardrobe when it comes to your winter coats. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell and join us. And to my returning friends, like Mike Reese, salute.

Say for example, our first recommendations, one of the best combinations of practicality and style. You definitely can't go wrong having in your winter rotation a Parker. Now of course, when we're talking about the Parker, we're talking about a coat that will help you in the coldest of weather. Designed for extreme cold, Parkers are often filled, often with downfill or synthetic feel that will help provide superior warmth. Also with the Parker, you get features such as a longer length in an adjustable hood that's often lined. You got some faux fur or real fur for a lot of Parker jackets. And of course the Parker is made of weather resistant materials, helping to protect you from the harshest of temperature, giving you coverage for snow, rain and wind. Beyond its practicality, the Parker, especially in its modern form, come in sleek designs and neutral colors, allowing you to wear it with a wide range of the other clothing in your winter wardrobe. And it's easy to pair a Parker for different settings, from casual to smart casual. A versatile and durable choice throughout the winter months, one of the best coats any guy can have, the Parker. Now next up on the list of the winter coats every guy should consider having in his wardrobe, we have one of my personal favorites. And I happen to be rocking one right now, an excellent winter coat choice, the wool overcoat. Now when we're talking about a great combination of time and sophistication and practical warmth, the wool overcoat gets the job done. And when we're talking about a versatile choice when those temperature drops, to me almost nothing beats the wool overcoat. I throw it on over a turtleneck, over a suit, a hoodie, it's just a stylish refined winter coat choice. Often made from high quality wool, not only does the wool overcoat look good, it provides excellent insulation against the cold weather you'll encounter throughout the winter months. Then you when you add in the tailored design of the wool overcoat, you have something that keeps you warm, but also has you looking sleek and sophisticated, making it perfect from anything from casual to the most formal of situation. The overcoat adds a touch of refinement to any winter ensemble. Especially if you grab one in the classic colors like camel, black, navy or charcoal. When we're talking about the wool overcoat, you've got something that gives you a polished appearance with tons of durability. Now next up on the list of the seven winter coat styles you should consider having in your wardrobe is to me the one that probably looks best on the widest range of guys. You definitely can't go wrong grabbing yourself a classic P coat. Now the P coat is a winter style essential because of how well it combines timeless design, warmth and versatility. P coat which originates from naval uniforms has that classic double breasted silhouette and wide lapels that offers both a polished and masculine look. Typically made from heavyweight wool, the P coat provides excellent insulation while at the same time maintaining a slim and tailored look which helps the P coat pair seamlessly with a wide range of outfits during the winter. Dress it up, dress it down, wear it with anything from a suit or more casual outfits like jeans and a sweater. And I also love that you can easily find a P coat in classic colors like navy, charcoal and gray. Meaning you'll find a P coat in the color that suits your style personality. With the P coat you get durability, elegant simplicity, masculine looks and an enduring style which all adds up to a must have winter staple. Now next up on the list of the seven must have winter coat styles we have an excellent combination of lightweight wear that still provides excellent warmth. You definitely can't go wrong with a puffer jacket. Now the puffer jacket is an excellent choice during the winter because how it combines excellent warmth, lightweight breathable wearability and versatility. Typically filled with down or synthetic feel the puffer jacket provides great insulation allowing them to trap heat very efficiently making them a great choice for that cold weather. And the great thing about the puffer jacket although keeps you very warm is lightweight providing ease of movement throughout the winter months. Whether communing, running errands or engaging outdoor activities it keeps you warm without feeling bulky and restricting. And I also love that puffer jacket is coming a wide range of styles and colors. Meaning you can grab one to fit your style, suit your personality and your wardrobe. And whether you're going to throw that puffer jacket on with more casual looks like your chinos in a sweater or a wide range of other outfits giving you an effortless combination throughout the winter months. You want a stylish and functional piece that gives you ease of movement while giving you warmth you definitely can't go wrong grabbing yourself a puffer jacket. Now next up on the list of excellent winter coat style choices you can grab this year is one that's a bit under rated in my opinion but still has a timeless design. I highly recommend you consider grabbing yourself a duffel coat. Now we're talking about a great winter essential the duffel coat provides practicality warm and a timeless charm in its design typically made from thick wool the duffel coat is going to give you excellent insulation and warmth but it also typically comes in a looser fit allowing you to layer during those cold winter months with its signature toggle fasteners deep pockets and hood the duffel coat gives you both a stylish look and great practicality. Originally designed for military use the duffel coat gives you a rugged masculine look while still giving you a bit of sophistication and refinement and it just pairs perfectly with a wide range of outfits as well. I love it with jeans and boots but I also love rocking my duffel coat with trousers and a sweater durable versatile timeless sophisticated masculine and rugged if you want a reliable winter staple that not every guy will be rocking grab yourself a duffel coat.

Now next up on the list of the seven must have winter coat styles I have another highly underappreciated one that will keep you warm but will make you stand out at the same time you definitely can't go wrong grabbing yourself a shirling jacket or coat. Now when we're talking about a shirling we're talking about a winter coat choice that has unmaxed warmth sophistication and rugged masculinity lined with soft insulating these coats keep you cozy in the coldest of weather while still exuding effortless style.

Confidence shows that you believe in yourself and your abilities, which naturally draws women in. Women are attracted to men who are very secure, but they don't feel the need to belittle others to prove it. Confidence fosters respect and trust, where arrogance often repels by making you appear insecure or dismissive.

Now this is a great way to appeal to more women because it shows you have passion, creativity, and you're beyond surface level. You have more depth, all qualities that are very appealing to the opposite sex. Engaging in your hobbies and interests shows you lead a fulfilling life and you have a personality beyond just work and routine. Not to mention, hobbies also provide opportunities for shared interest and activity. It can lead to meaningful conversations and memorable experiences you can find out the women you're around have the same interests. And this will make it much easier for you to connect with women on a personal level. Whether it's hiking, cooking, photography, or playing an instrument, pursuing activities you enjoy reflects confidence and individuality.

When you show genuine interest by actively listening, asking thoughtful questions, and remembering details she's shared about her life, it shows that you genuinely care about what she has to say.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into an often overlooked but very important topic. 10 things you should never do to your balls. Now, your health and your comfort depend on how you treat this sensitive area. And there's some common habits that may be causing more harm than you realize. From grooming mistakes to lifestyle choices, we will break down the dos and don'ts to keep you informed and in control of your health. So stick around as we get into how to treat your boys with the care they deserve. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell and join us. And to my returning friends like Jeremy Sanders, Salute. Now, first up on the list of the 10 things you should never do to your balls. Expose them to extreme heat. The problem is this extreme heat can negatively affect sperm production and your overall testicular health. You see our testicles with specifically designed to remain cooler than our rest of our body, as this lower tip is essential for healthy sperm production. When you overheat the balls with things such as saunas, hot tubs or even placing your laptop directly on your lap, you can disrupt this temperature balance, leading to reduction in sperm count, motility and sperm quality. Not to mention exposing this area to extreme heat can lead to discomfort, swelling and even temporary infertility. So for your long-term reproductive health, avoid extreme heat. You want to offer breathable clothing and take frequent breaks if you're engaging in activity that produce extreme heat. This will help you maintain a cooler environment that will lead to optimal sperm production and comfort. Now, next up is a very common mistake guys often make when it comes to your balls. Neglecting to do regular self-examination. By not doing monthly, regularly self-examinations of your testicles, you're putting yourself at high risk of not detecting serious situations like testicular cancer, which is very common in the guys ages 15 to 35, but can occur at any age. You have to realize that early detection in this case significantly improves your chances of survival. By doing regular self-exams, you become familiar with the size, shape and feel of your testicles, which makes it very easy for you to detect any abnormalities or changes, especially like lumps, swellings or unusual texture. Ignoring this habit can lead to you missing other conditions like cysts, infections or varicose cells, which can worsen if not detected. Forming a monthly self-exam in a warm shower is a quick, easy habit to develop and it could potentially be life saving. Now, next up is something I highly recommend you make sure you're not doing. Do not ignore pain or swelling in your balls. This is a huge mistake because these symptoms might indicate a serious underlying condition that requires immediate attention. Puzzles of pain or swelling in your testicles can range from minor things such as an infection or minor injuries or it could be a major problem like testicular torsion where the blood flow is cut off from your testicles. Or you might even miss a hernia or testicular cancer. Left untreated, these conditions often lead to long term damage that you could have held off if you paid attention. It can lead to infertility or even the loss of a testicle. Swelling or pain might also indicate an underlying condition like a hydro cell, which definitely would benefit from early intervention. So no matter what you do, if you have some pain or swelling in your testicles, do not ignore it, seek medical attention promptly to make sure you get the proper diagnosis and treatment. Next up is a hygiene mistake that's often not on people's radars. Make sure when you wash your testicles, you're not using hard soaps or chemicals. This can be a problem because it easily can lead to dryness, irritation and discomfort because the skin in this area is very thin and fragile. You see many soaps and body washes contain strong detergents. Synthetic fragrances or alcohol, which can strip away the natural oils the body produces to protect this fragile skin. And this can lead to redness, itching or even allergic reaction. Overtime, frequent use of these hard soaps or chemicals can lead to the stripping away of your skin's natural barrier, which can easily increase the risk of infections like jock itch or fungal overgrowth. Instead, you want to offer mild pH balance, fragrance free cleansers when it comes to cleaning your ball. Especially soaps that are specifically designed for sensitive areas. Gentle cleansers ensure proper hygiene without any irritation. Now, next up is a huge problem I noticed when I run into the convenience store. I'm talking to you, gas station Gary, please make sure you're not using unimproved sexual enhancers. These can be very detrimental to your testicular health because they often contain unregulated harmful substances that can disrupt your hormonal balance and reproductive health. You see these products often can include undeclared ingredients. If you don't know what's in it, why are you taking it? And they often include excessive amounts of testosterone boosters, which can easily impair your body's natural testosterone production. And over time, this hormonal imbalance can lead to reduced sperm production, testicular shrinkage or infertility. If you're going to take anything for sexual enhancement, make sure you go to a health care provider first, get the proper medical oversight to make sure you're taking something that's good for your health and your sexual performance. Next up on the list of the 10 things you never do to your balls, no consistent wearing of tight underwear. You see this can negatively impact your testicular health by increasing heat and reducing blood flow to your groin area. Remember, your testicles are naturally placed outside of your body for cooler temperatures that leads to better sperm production. Tight underwear traps heat and can disrupt the balance, potentially leading to a lower sperm count and reduced fertility. Also, restricted movement, which can be caused by tight underwear, can lead to chafing, irritation, and of course, discomfort. Not to mention prolonged use of tight underwear can lead to conditions like varicose cell, which are large veins in your scrotum that can potentially affect testicular function. Instead, what you want to do is offer breathable, well-fitted cotton underwear. This will ensure comfort, airflow and optimal testicular health. I also want to make sure you're not making this groin mistake. Please don't overdo the trimming and shaving of the hairs around your balls. Here's why it can easily deprive like nicks, cuts, irritation and ingrown hairs, which can be comfortable and potentially lead to infections. Remember, the skin in this area is thin and fragile. And being too aggressive or grooming the area too frequently can easily lead to damage. Using dull blades or improper techniques increases the risk of razor burn, cuts and redness. Who wants that around their balls? And over trimming and shaving too close can interrupt the natural protection that hair provides to the testicular area, making them more susceptible to chafing, irritation or bacterial infection. To avoid these problems, trim or shave with extreme care. Use body trimmer specifically designed for sensitive area and space out your grooming sessions to allow the skin in this area to recover and heal. Now, next up is another off the radar problem you may not realize can harm your testicles. Prolonged sitting without breaks sitting for long periods of time without standing and stretching out, crease temperature and restricted blood flow to the groin area. A problem, of course, when seated for extended periods of time, especially with tight clothing, you're going to increase the heat to the area, potentially affecting sperm production and your reproductive health. Not to mention, reduced circulation caused by prolonged sitting can cause discomfort or restricted blood flow. It also can contribute to muscle stiffness and poor posture, which can negatively affect your comfort and overall health. Keep your testicles and body in optimal condition. If you have to sit for extended periods of time, take breaks, stand up, stretch and move around. Trust me, it's good for your balls. Now, next up is something that's very common since when it comes to your balls, but I believe it bears saying anyway, please avoid heavy pressure or trauma. Crucial because you got to remember this is a highly sensitive area that's very vulnerable to injury. You have to keep in mind that your balls are protected only by a very thin layer of skin and muscle, which makes them very susceptible to bruising, swelling or even more serious condition like testicular rupture. Now, as I probably don't have to tell you, all of us have been hitting the balls before. This area is very sensitive even to minor trauma and repeated or forceful impact can lead to serious problems or it can lead to long term damage like reduced fertility or hormonal problems and heavy pressure can impact blood flow, which can lead to problems such as tissue damage or inflammation. So please, no matter what you do, protect those balls. If you're engaged in sports, wear a protective cup or when engaging in physical activities, avoid situations that can lead to heavy pressure or trauma. Now, next up is a mistake I want to make sure you're not making when it comes to your testicular health, but your overall health as well. Please don't neglect your regular checkups. This is a problem because it can easily lead to undiagnosed conditions that can worsen over time. I'm talking about conditions like varicose cells, testicular cancer, infections. These often have no early symptoms, but can definitely lead to significant problems down the road if left untreated. Getting your annual regular checkups, your doctor can be on the lookout for changes or abnormalities in your testicular health before they become serious, improving the chances of effective treatment. Now, especially for older guys, early detection of testicular problems is very important. It can ward off complications like fertility or irreversible damage. So make sure you're scheduling and making your annual exams and bring up any concerns you have with your health care provider. This will ensure proactive care and safeguarding your overall health and specifically your testicular health. OK, there you have it. 10 things you should never do to your balls. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comments section. Any health care concerns you think guys should be on the lookout when it comes to their testicular health.

Its combination of style, versatility, and understated charm makes the denim trucker jacket a timeless piece in your wardrobe and one that women love to see on you. With staying in the denim category for the next casual item women love, you definitely can't go wrong rocking a pair of dark wash jeans.

When you wear a jean with a dark hue, it gives you the versatility and sophistication, the perfect pair of jeans to dress up or dress down, making them work for a wide range of situations from a casual get together to an evening date. Unlike their lighter wash counterparts, dark wash jeans also have a slimming effect, giving you a nice flattering silhouette that will easily enhance your overall appearance. And another great thing about dark wash jeans is that versatility. They work with anything from t-shirts, button ups, sweaters, your favorite jackets making them a reliable staple in any man's wardrobe. Understated classic vibe of dark wash jeans suggests a man who pays attention to style without trying too hard, very appealing to the ladies. With staying in the classic casual category for the next item women love to see on us, they definitely don't mind you rocking a V-neck sweater. Now the V-neck sweater is a great choice because of its blend of approachability and sophistication. The V-shaped neckline draws attention to your collarbone and your chest, creating a flattering silhouette. One that elongates the neck and adds a touch of refinement. Worn over a t-shirt or a button down Oxford, the V-neck sweater layers beautifully, offering a versatile look that's effortlessly stylish. An intelligent fit of a good V-neck sweater hugs your torso without being tight and enhancing your overall appearance while maintaining your comfort at the same time. And when you select the V-neck sweater in natural or earth tones, it gives a sense of warmth and elegance, making them a perfect choice for casual outings or dates. And when it comes to rocking a sweater in a casual way that the women will pay attention to, you can't go wrong with the V-neck sweater. You may be picking it up on a theme as we get into the next casual item women love to see on us. Without a doubt, a classic fitted t-shirt. The classic fitted t-shirt is definitely an eye catcher when it comes to the ladies because when it fits you well, it highlights areas they pay attention to. I'm talking about your broad shoulders, your chest, your toned arms. And it does all of this with an effortless vibe. The simplicity of a t-shirt allows you to show off your physique without it looking like it's overdone, striking the perfect balance between casual and attractive. And of course, when you select a classic t-shirt in great neutral colors like white, gray, navy or black, all these colors are particularly appealing because they complement a wide range of skin tones and style. When you're selecting your t-shirt, you want one that closely skims the body, not one that's tight or too loose. This will give you a clean sharp look that exudes confidence. Pair this classic t-shirt with your favorite jeans, boots, sneakers, you name it. It's a classic wardrobe staple that always makes a great casual impression. Now, next up on the list, we have a piece that gives off that same classic vibe of a t-shirt, but it's a bit of a step up. You definitely can't go wrong when it comes to the ladies rocking a Henley shirt. The thing about a Henley that turns the women's heads is that it balances simplicity with a rugged masculine edge. Button neckline on the Henley adds a touch of versatility and style, making it more interesting than your standard t-shirt while still maintaining a relaxed look. And of course, it's fitted design, highlights parts of your body you'll want to show off, those broad shoulders, your chest, and your arms subtly showing off your physique without it seeming like you're trying too hard. Not to mention, Henleys are incredibly versatile, with them with chinos, jeans. Dress them up, dress them down. Henleys are suitable for wide range of occasions. Not to mention the test rig fabrics and earthy colors often associated with Henleys makes them approachable, warm, and inviting. When you're talking about a shirt that's relaxed and casual, but a step above a standard t-shirt, when you want to make an impression with the ladies, you can't go wrong with a Henley. Now, next up is a wardrobe staple. You won't be surprised to see if you've been following this channel for any amount of time. Yes, I love them, but the ladies do too. You can't go wrong rocking chinos. Now, the reason why chinos are casual I and the women love to see on you is because how well they strike the perfect balance between relaxed and refined. Unlike jeans, chinos offer a slightly dressier look that won't come across as stuffy as a traditional trouser. This means you're able to step your game up over dinner, but still look versatile and laid back. The tailored fit of chinos flattens your legs and enhances your overall silhouette without coming off as too formal. Not to mention chinos come in a wide range of colors, from neutral to bold to earthy, which makes them pair effortlessly with a wide range of items in your wardrobe. From t-shirts, button downs, and sweaters, making chinos work in a wide range of occasions. Not to mention the lightweight, breathable fabric of a chino makes them comfortable, while still maintaining a clean and polished look. If you want the most versatile pair of pants you can have in your wardrobe, and ones that will catch the ladies' eyes as well, you never can go wrong rocking a pair of chinos. Now, next up on the list is one of the best combinations of cozy, comfortable, but still put together. You definitely can't go wrong rocking a fitted hoodie. Now, the reason why ladies like seeing a fitted hoodie on us, because they combine comfort with a clean, stylish appearance. When you're rocking that fitted hoodie, highlights the chest, shoulders, and arms, subtly emphasizing your physique, while maintaining that cool, relaxed, athletic vibe. When it comes to a fitted hoodie, the mix of structure and a relaxed vibe gives off an approachable, laid-back energy that many women find very appealing. And the great thing about a fitted hoodie, as opposed to its overly baggy counterpart, there's a lot more versatility with the fitted one. I rocked them with anything from joggers, jeans, to even a trouser. I find them that versatile. Fitted hoodie is a perfect blend of functionality, style, comfort, and appeal. Now, next up, we have another classic wardrobe staple that women love with a bit of a finishing detail. You definitely can't go wrong with an Oxford button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. This is a classic look that women love because of its blend of sophistication and relaxed, laid-back appeal at the same time. The great thing about an Oxford button-down, no matter whether you roll up the sleeves or not, is its structured fit, that once again, like a lot of other items on our list, highlights the areas you want to highlight, your chest, your shoulders, your arms. And especially when you roll up your sleeves, it highlights an underrated part of our body that women actually pay attention to, our forearms. Rolling up the sleeves adds a little bit of a laid-back, relaxed charm. An effortless look that suggests confidence and approachability. Not to mention when it comes to versatility in your wardrobe, almost no shirt can beat the Oxford button-down. You can wear in a wide range of situations, from casual to semi-formal, and everything in between. Making it perfect for daytime, outings, or even to get-togethers like that date. When it comes to wearing an Oxford button-down with the sleeves rolled up, you have a perfect balance of refinement and ease, which convince a sense of style that's authentic and approachable. Now, next up on the list, I have a great pair of classic footwear that would turn the ladies' heads. You definitely can't go wrong rocking classic sneakers. Classic sneakers are definitely something women want to see on you, because of how well they blend versatility, style, and timeless design. Allow you to have a relaxed, laid-back vibe, without being overly designed like some current trendy sneakers might be. And there's a wide range of classic sneakers you can choose from. I'm more of an Adidas head, so you'll often catch me in some Stan Smiths or some Sambas. But there's a wide range of classic sneakers from brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, that would work just as well when they have that great classic design. Understated design of a classic sneaker complements a grown man's wardrobe. Giving you a put-together look, but still giving you a bit of a youthful, relaxed energy. Women love classic sneakers on you because they highlight a confidence and simplicity, showing your confidence in your style without having to wear something over the top and overly trendy. Now, next up on the list of the 10 casual items women love to see on men was Stan in the footwear department. You definitely can't go wrong rocking your favorite pair of boots. Now, boots are casual item women love because they add a rugged stylist's edge to any casual outfit. Whether we're talking about a classic sleek pair of Chelsea boots or more rugged outdoorsy style like a worker hiking boot, a great pair of boots can instantly elevate any outfit.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into the 11 essential nighttime grooming habits every man should employ, especially those of us who are embracing, let's just call them our mature years. A solid nighttime grooming routine isn't just about looking good, it's about feeling confident and staying sharp as we age. In these 11 simple habits I'm going to share with you today, we'll have you feeling waking up refreshed, looking your best, and ready to take on the day. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of your topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Gerald Goody, salut. Now first up on the list of the nighttime grooming habits every guy should employ, especially us OGs, you definitely want to make sure you start off by washing your face. And now I know a lot of guys out there that do have a grooming routine, you probably only wash your face in the morning, but that's a mistake. It's very important before you hit the sack that you wash your face to remove the day's dirt, oil, grime, and environmental pollutants that may have accumulated throughout the day. By cleansing your skin at night, it will help you hold off some of the signs of aging that you might see. I'm talking about dry skin, fine lines, and uneven textures. Not to mention washing your face prepares your skin for the other steps we're going to take throughout the nighttime routine, such as moisturizer, skin tightening serum. By washing your face first, you allow these other products to be absorbed more effectively, deeper, and get the job done better. Also washing your face before bed, helps prevent ingrown hairs, especially for my guys with facial hair. It's very important just as it is in the morning time to wash your face before you hit the sack. Another fantastic grooming habit you want to employ at nighttime, apply an anti-aging skin tightening serum. This is an excellent product for my OGs to use, because what it does is it addresses some common signs of aging, like fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. By applying this serum at night, it works very well in conjunction with your body's natural repairing that occurs while you sleep, making the perfect time to apply targeted products like a serum. It can include ingredients like retinol, which is good to building up collagen, which will improve your skin's elasticity. And they oftentimes will also include hyaluronic acid, which is good for boosting your moisture, and vitamin C, which helps brighten your skin. These ingredients all work together to smooth out wrinkles, tighten your skin, and enhance your overall skin texture. One of the best nighttime grooming habits, use an anti-aging skin tightening serum. Another clutch nighttime grooming habit I highly recommend you employ, every night apply some eye cream. Now this is a smart habit, especially for us older guys, because the skin around your eyes is so delicate. One of the first areas prone to showing your age, naturally trying to prevent that with an eye cream, is a smart move. You see this thin, fragile skin around your eyes is prone to dryness, puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles, especially as we become more mature. Therefore, applying an eye cream before you go to bed, it targets the area, providing hydration and nourishment as your body goes through its natural repair cycle overnight. And eye creams that include ingredients like peptides, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid help to smooth wrinkles, and also can help brighten tired-looking eyes. And nighttime application of the eye cream ensures that your body has time to absorb it and to get to work, leaving your skin feeling refreshed, smooth, giving you a much more youthful appearance in the morning. Nighttime is also a perfect time, in my opinion, to do something that a lot of us neglect to do, whether it's in the morning or nighttime. Make sure you look to see if you need your nose, ear, or eyebrow hair trimmed. Now, I know I don't have to tell a lot of you out there, as men, as we get older, we tend to grow more nose hair, ear hair, and our eyebrows become more unruly, meaning we have to stay more on top of it. By taking care of this area at night, you have more time to make sure you have proper lighting, the right tools, and you can take your time to avoid making mistakes or missing areas altogether. Also, taking care of it at night, make sure you're going to wake up looking professional and put together. It's a simple yet effective way to maintain a sharp, youthful-looking appearance. And taking the time to do this regularly, especially when you have time at night, helps prevent sudden, embarrassing surprises the next day. Now, next up, I have an excellent habit I want to suggest to my guys out there who have to shade. You might want to try using at night a pre-shave treatment. A pre-shave treatment is a great, simple habit because what it does for you, it wraps your skin for a smoother, more comfortable shave in the morning. Pre-shave treatments help remove dead skin cells, unclog your pores, and soften facial hair, making it much more easy for your razor to glide across your skin. A nighttime application of your pre-shave treatment, just like with a lot of the products we're going to talk about today, gives them time to be fully absorbed, helping it work overnight and will actually help prevent ingrown hairs, redness, and irritation. This is especially useful for us older guys, because as we age, our skin becomes thinner and more sensitive. By incorporating a pre-shave treatment, the next day your shade will be smoother, comfortable, and it will be a lot less irritating. Now, next up is a nighttime grooming habit I want to recommend to you guys out there that will help address some overlooked areas no matter what the man's age. You want to moisturize your hands and feet at night. And now, this is a fantastic habit to get into, especially as you get older, because our skin, as we age, often experience more dryness, cracking, and becomes much more rough. Do you see the skin in our hands especially is exposed to a lot of daily wear and tear? Our feet are very prone to constant pressure and friction. Applying a rich moisturizer to your hands and feet before you go to bed, of course, say with me, it allows it to work overnight, which will help soften calluses, hydrate dry skin, and soothe any irritation you might have on your hands and feet. And it can also help decrease conditions such as cracked heels or brittle nails. For added benefit, I recommend using moisturizers with ingredients such as shea butter and glycerin, which helps add up to some more intense hydration. Take it from me. At night time before bed, moisturize those hands and feet. Now, next up is a grooming habit you might want to employ at night that I believe is a secret weapon a lot of guys don't use for healthier, fresher skin. You want to exfoliate your face once or twice a week with a facial scrub. Now, the point of exfoliation is this. Our skin can accumulate on the top layer dead skin cells. By using a facial scrub, it helps remove some of these dead skin cells and revealing the fresher, more useful skin underneath. If you leave those dead skin cells on the top layer, it leads to a duller complexion, clogged pores, and rough skin. When you exfoliate, it helps reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and also helps stimulate the skin renewal process. Plying your facial scrub at night gives your skin time to recover and also help absorb other products you might apply at night time. You want to only use a facial scrub once or twice a week to prevent irritation. This is not something you want to do every night, but for the twice a week that you do, it will leave your skin smoother, softer, healthier, fresher, and more youthful looking. Now, next up, I want to get back more to a more basic grooming habit you probably already employed during the day, but you need to do it just as much at night. You want to make sure at night you're applying moisturizer. Now, applying a moisturizer to your face at night is especially important for us older guys because as we age, our skin becomes drier. You just see a natural decline in the hydration of your skin as you get older. You want to fight against that by using a nighttime moisturizer. Playing a rich, nourishing moisturizer before you go to bed allows your skin to, of course, be more hydrated, but it also helps even your skin texture and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. It also will prevent a common problem that happens as we get older, rough skin texture. Natural repair process that goes on during the night helps the moisturizer work better. And a bonus point for a nighttime moisturizer if it includes ingredients such as peptides, hyaluronic acids, or ceramides, which can help improve your skin's elasticity and help remove the appearance of wrinkles. Now, another one of my favorite nighttime habits that you only need to do maybe once or twice a week is one of my favorite ones to get a deep cleanse. Once or twice a week, I recommend you apply a facial mud mask. The great thing about applying a mud mask, it helps remove impurities from your skin like dirt, oil, grime, to mention toxins that may have accumulated throughout the day. As we get older, our skin's texture can be more rougher, have uneven skin tone, or clog pores. A mud mask helps with all that. It helps unclog your pores, reduce the appearance of fine lines, giving you a refreshed and revitalized look in the morning. Not to mention by applying the mask at night, it allows your skin time to recover and absorb the product, especially when a mud mask contains great beneficial ingredients like minerals and antioxidants. Incorporating a mud mask once or twice a week will help leave you with brighter, fresher, and healthier skin, not to mention skin that's smoother and more youthful looking. Now, next up is important nighttime habit that you should employ throughout the day. That's fantastic not only for your skin, but your bodily functions as a whole. Before you go to bed, drink a small glass of water. Drinking a glass of water before bed is very clutch because it helps with your skin hydration and as I mentioned, all of your body system. As I've said throughout this video, as we age, our skin naturally loses some of its moisture and elasticity, which can lead to those fine lines, dryness, and wrinkles. Staying hydrated within by drinking water helps those skin cells become renewed and promote a more healthy, youthful appearance. Water also aids in flushing toxins, improving digestion, and kidney function. Always have a positive effect on your skin clarity and texture. Now word to the wise, however, moderation is key. You don't want to drink a ton of water before bed because you know that'll lead to frequent bathroom trips. So what I recommend you do before you hit the sack, drink a small glass of water. This will help you strike the right balance, improve your complexion, and will complement your external skincare from within. Now, next up is one of the most absolute important nighttime habits no matter what a man's age. Make sure you're getting proper quality nights of sleep every night. Getting proper sleep is an essential benefit, even in your grooming, because as we've been talking throughout today's video, at night when you're sleeping is when your body repairs and renews itself. While you sleep, your body produces collagen, which helps improve the elasticity of your skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Not to mention getting proper nights of sleep improves your blood circulation, which helps your skin have a natural, healthy glow. But on the other end of the spectrum, poor quality sleep will lead to puffy eyes, dark circles, and dull complexion. All signs of fatigue that will aid you prematurely. Not to mention quality sleep enhances the other nighttime grooming habits we're trying to develop. The products will work in tandem with your body's natural regenerative processes. Okay, so there you have it. 11 of the best nighttime grooming habits for the older man. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comment section if you have any clutch nighttime grooming routines you go through that you believe can help the Stalogy fam.

Now watch is the ultimate accessory, but it's easy to make small mistakes that impact both your style and your look. That's what we're going to try to avoid on today's video. From choosing the right size watch to pairing the right watch with your outfit, we're going to cover everything you need to make sure you avoid these watch wearing pitfalls. So stay tuned to make sure you're rocking your timepiece the right way. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us until my returning friends like Wendell Haines, salute. First up on the list of the nine worst watch wearing mistakes guys often make, wearing the wrong size watch. This is a mistake that can throw off your entire look. If you wear a watch that's too large for your wrist size, it can come across as clunky and disproportionate. But on the other hand, if the watch is too small, it can come off as delicate and seem out of place. Ideally your watch case diameter will align with the size of your wrist. This will give you a look that's balanced and proportionate. What you want is for your watch case to fall within the borders of each side of your wrist, with a little bit of room on the side. And to simplify it even more, I've got a shopping guide for you. All you need to do is measure the diameter of your wrist with a tape measure. Right below your wrist bone. If it measures six and a half inches or lower, you have a small wrist. Six and a half to seven and a half inches, you've got a medium wrist. And above seven point five, you've got a large wrist. So when you go out shopping, my small to medium size wrist guides, you want to watch diameter that's 38 to 42 millimeter. And for my larger wrist size guides, 40 to 46 will probably work well for you. Right size watch enhances your overall look, giving you sophistication without looking forced. Our next common watch wearing mistake, a watch that doesn't fit properly around your wrist. This is a common mistake that can impact both your style and your comfort. Say for example, if your watch is too loose around your wrist or it hangs below your wrist bone, this will come off as sloppy and it might even risk damage to your watch. But on the other hand, a watch that's too tight is super uncomfortable. It can make imprints on your skin and will make your wrist look constricted. A well fitted watch should rest comfortably right above your wrist bone. And then it should stay in place throughout the day without much movement. This not only enhances your look by giving you a balanced polished appearance, but it also makes watch wearing much more enjoyable. Now next up is a common watch mistake. That's a little bit subjective, but I stand behind it. It's a watch mistake to wear your watch on the dominant side. What I mean is a right handed guy should not be wearing his watch on his right wrist. The first reason it easily interferes with your daily task, writing, using tools, or even just reaching into your pocket. Not to mention it can affect the longevity of your watch. When you wear a watch on your dominant side, you risk more wear and tear, increasing the risk of scratches, bumps, and damage. And even simple things like checking the time. You might have to set down whatever you have in your hand to be able to read the dial easily. Wearing a watch on your non-dominant hand reduces all these issues greatly. It ensures greater ease and durability in your watch. It helps keep your style refined and functional. Wear that watch on your non-dominant hand. Now next up is another subjective watch mistake, but it's another one I stand firmly behind. Not matching the metals and leathers with your watch with the other accessories in your outfit. When you don't match them, say for example, a brown leather watch with black shoes or silver watch with gold accessories. This is an easy way to make your look come off as clashing and uncoordinated. When you match your leather and metals with the rest of your accessories, you come off as polished and intentional. For example, pairing a black leather watch strap with a black belt and black shoe easily creates harmony in your look. Similarly, matching your metals like a silver metal watch band, would say for example, a silver belt buckle gives you a balanced and proportional look. Showing an eye for refinement and make your outfit look complete. Now however, I will admit, this doesn't have to be a hard and fast rule. There's some style experts that can get away with mixing and matching. But for most of us, it doesn't work. Now another very common watch wearing mistake guys often make, not matching your watch to your outfit appropriately. When you don't wear the appropriate watch with your clothing, it can make your look come off as mismatched or incomplete. Watches just like your clothes come in different styles designed for different occasions. Wearing a sporty dive watch with your best suit really doesn't match. It's too casual. While wearing a super dressy watch, usually it's not going to match your jeans. It just seems out of place. Each watch style, whether it's about dressy, sporty, or casual conveys a certain vibe, just like certain outfits convey a certain vibe. That's why you want to make sure you watch the lines both with your outfit and the occasion. Matching a sleek dress watch with your best formal wear or maybe a rugged field watch with casual tire shows intentionality and thoughtfulness. When your watch compliments your outfit, it creates a polished cohesive look that enhances your overall outfit effortlessly. Now, next up is the watch mistake I have to admit I've made one too many times for my liking. Wearing a leather watch strap in extreme heat. This is a common watch wearing mistake because leather is just not ideal for heat and humidity. When temperatures rise, sweat can make your leather band absorb moisture, leading to discoloration, odor, and wear and tear on your leather strap. Not to mention leather straps will often feel uncomfortable and sticky in the hotter months, especially if that leather watch strap is a little on the tight fitting side. For warmer months, what I recommend wear a watch with a rubber strap, a nine line strap, a metal strap. These are much more breathable, durable, and resistant to higher temperature. Opting for a summer friendly watch band will extend the lifespan of your leather watches, but it will also ensure comfort, allowing you to wear your watch with style and practicality. Now, next up is the common watch mistake I see guys making all too often, especially over the last five years, spending loads of money on a watch. This is a huge watch mistake, especially if the watch doesn't fit your lifestyle, your needs, or even more importantly, your budget. High price watches often come with luxury branding and intricate craftsmanship, but they might not provide significant benefits over a well-made, affordable watch. And here's the dirty secret about expensive watches. They require more maintenance, insurance, and proper care, which adds to the ongoing costs of owning it. And although some high-end watches can be investments, the resale value will vary greatly. And oftentimes, this won't justify the initial expense. Way too many great watches out there made by affordable brands. I'm thinking about Citizen, Seiko, Casio. The list goes on and on. It's so easy to choose a watch that resonates with your personal preferences and fits your lifestyle, instead of buying a high-end watch for its luxury brand or its popularity when it comes to trend. All you need to do is buy a watch you truly love that you can reasonably afford. Now, after you've gone out and bought that watch that resonates with you, don't make this next mistake. Avoiding cleaning it regularly. You gotta clean your watch regularly. Not only does it affect its appearance, it affects its longevity. Watches easily accumulate dirt, grime, sweat, oil, which can dull the metal, stain the straps, or even clog some of your working parts, easily impacting the performance of your timepiece. Not to mention leather straps can easily become cracked or discolored if you don't clean them regularly. Wild metals can easily become dull and lose their shine. So you want to make sure you're regularly cleaning your watches. I recommend every two weeks. You can use a soft cloth and mild soap. This can easily prevent buildup on your watch, which will enhance your watch's appearance and its functionality. By regularly cleaning your watch, it will last much longer and look better for an extended period of time. Now, next up is a watch mistake about wearing a watch at all. You actually shouldn't wear a watch with a tuxedo. Wearing a watch with your black tie clothing is considered a style mistake because it contradicts the timeless elegance and formality of your tuxedo. The essence of a tuxedo is to give a refined, sophisticated look, free of distractions and emphasizing simplicity. When you wear a watch on your wrist, when you have on your black tie clothing, it can disrupt the clean uninterrupted lines of your tuxedo. On top of that, historically wearing a watch with a tuxedo has been considered inappropriate. Here's why. Because when you wear a watch, it suggests a focus on time, which contradicts the leisurely, event-focused spirit of a black tie affair. Often thought, when you wear a watch with a tuxedo, you'll be worried about the time instead of enjoying yourself in the present. Embracing literally a timeless look often enhances the look of your tuxedo. If you want a clean, smooth, uninterrupted look when you're rocking your tuxedo, go without a watch. Okay, so there you have it. Nine of the worst watch wearing mistakes guys often make. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section some watch wearing mistakes you think guys make that I might have left off today's list.

        "transcript": " Today I'm going to break down exactly how you should dress for wide range of job interviews, no matter what the field, to make sure you make the best first impression. Whether you're interviewing for a corporate position, a creative role, or a startup job, the right outfit can help you stand out and show that you understand the company's culture. So stay tuned as we go through a step-by-step breakdown of everything you should wear on that job interview to feel confident, look professional, and make sure your wardrobe works for you, no matter what the interview situation. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us until my returning friends like Chris Hall, salute. We're gonna start off our breakdown on exactly how to dress for any job interview at the most formal level, the corporate finance or consulting position. Now in industries like law, finance, or consulting, professionalism is paramount. That's why it's typically expected that you're gonna wear formal attire. What do we mean by formal attire? A suit, a dark suit. Think navy, charcoal, black, and a solid color suit is ideal. Avoid bold patterns. If you are gonna wear a pattern, a subtle pinstripe or check is usually acceptable. Dress shirt on, you want white or light blue. This will give you a fresh polished look. Make sure it's ironed and wrinkle-free and stain-free. Then I highly suggest you wear a tie, a conservative tie, like a solid color one. A solid color one that compliments the suit you're wearing. Then let's break down the shoes. You wanna wear polished black or dark brown dress shoes, no loafers, no casual shoes. And when it comes to accessories in the corporate finance or consulting job, minimal at best. A classic watch, and if you're married, your wedding ring. But other than that, no other accessories in my opinion. And a little bit about your presentation when you walk in. Make sure your suit is pressed and dry clean. If it's well in the shoulders and the waist, make sure your shoes are polished, your hair trimmed and your nails are clean. Now let's go to the opposite end of the spectrum and talk about what my blue collar brothers should wear on their trade or labor interview. In situations like trade jobs, labor-intensive positions, a full suit is excessive. You wanna wear something that's clean and functional and shows that you're ready for hands-on work. So what does that include? Let's start with the shirt. You wanna wear plain or lightly patterned button-down shirt or if it's warm weather, a polo shirt, preferably in a dark color to avoid showing stains. Now for your pants, you can go with chinos or dark jeans. Both of these are acceptable as long as there's no distressing or they're not overly casual. Now for your shoes, I recommend a solid closed-toe shoe or leather work boot. Especially if there's a chance you will visit the work site for accessories for my blue collar brothers, a classic watch, and a plain leather belt. That's it. When you're interviewing for these labor-intensive or trade jobs, you wanna primarily focus on practicality over formality. You wanna prioritize a neat, clean, and functional look. Especially because for some trade positions, cleanliness and attention to detail are very important. Now let's talk about what you should wear for a creative field interview. I'm thinking things like media, design, advertising. Now in these situations, you get a little more leeway for expressing your style. Go ahead and show a little bit more creativity, but make sure you keep it in professional and refined. Now for a shirt, I would consider a stylish button-down or polo, or if in cold or weather, I might even throw on a nice turtleneck. Darker or unique colors can work very well. Now for your pants, I'll wear some nice slim fit chinos or dark jeans. These are typically acceptable if they're well-maintained and free from rips and distressing. And as an option, I might throw on a blazer on top of that outfit. One with a bold color or pattern can add a bit of flair, especially if it complements the rest of your look. Or I might even throw on a casual leather jacket if it fits the company's culture. Now as far as shoes, I recommend something like some nice leather loafers, some ankle boots, or some stylish dress shoes that can add some flair to your look without it being overly formal. Now when it comes to accessories for my creative guys, feel free to express yourself through your final details. Maybe a unique watch, a subtle bracelet, or some pattern socks. Remember when you go in there, creative fields encourage individuality. Feel free to show a little bit more expression of your personal style, especially through things like patterns, color, and accessories. But make sure your choices reflect thoughtfulness and are too far out there that they cause distraction. Now what if you have a customer service or retail position interview? In these customer facing positions, being polished and approachable is the key. Now in this situation, casual attire can work, but it's really based upon the company's image. What do I recommend? Let's start with the shirt. A neat button down shirt or a polo in a neutral color is preferred. And you wanna make sure you avoid any obvious logos unless it's related to the company. Now for your pants, I would go with chinos or dress pants. You probably should avoid jeans unless you're sure it fits the company's dress code. As far as shoes for retail or customer service position, you want something that's polished but comfortable. I'm thinking something like loafers or derbies. Something that shows you having attention to detail without being too formal. As far as accessories for a customer service or retail job, keep it simple. A leather belt, a classic watch, this is probably as far as you wanna go. You don't want your accessories to be distracting. And when you walk into an interview for this job, remember customer service positions focus on approachability. So what you wanna keep in mind, you wanna have a neat and friendly appearance. And another major key, make sure you're smiling and have good posture. This will enhance your professionalism. Now let's talk about a type of interview that's happening more and more no matter what the field in our modern day. What should you wear for a virtual or remote interview? Now even though the interview is remote, what you wear is still important. It will impact your confidence and the impression you make on screen. So what exactly should you wear for a virtual interview? Let's start with the shirt. I would stay with a simple button down or a nice sweater. One in a solid medium tone is preferable. I would avoid bright white or bold patterns which can be very distracting on camera. And for a virtual interview, I recommend throwing on a blazer on top. This will enhance your professionalism and make you come across as more serious, especially for formal roles. And we still need to talk about pants even though it's a virtual interview. Even if you're only gonna be seen from the top up, I believe wearing chinos or dress pants just puts you in a professional mindset. Now as far as accessories for a virtual interview, you definitely wanna keep it minimal. Maybe a classic watch. You wanna avoid any accessory that can distract or even worse, make noise. Now let's talk a little bit about the presentation in this virtual interview. You wanna focus on having good lighting and position yourself in front of a clean, neutral background. It can enhance your confidence and help you convey professionalism, even virtually. How about if you have a tech or startup interview? In these fields, a more casual approach is usually acceptable. I'm thinking casual or maybe even smart casual. But remember, it's still important that you look sharp. What do I recommend? Well, for a shirt, maybe a lightly patterned or solid color button down. Or if the weather is a little cooler, I might throw on top a fitted sweater or a cardigan. As far as pants, I would go with chinos or nicely tailored pair of dress pants in a neutral color. Think navy, gray, khaki. These will help you strike a nice balance between casual and formal. And once again in a situation, a great optional choice, throw on a blazer. This can help elevate your outfit without coming cross is too stuffy. For shoes for a tech or startup job, I like a nice pair of leather loafers, some brogues or even some minimalist sneakers. As long as they're not too trendy, casual or athletic. And as far as accessories for this startup interview, keep it simple again, a classic watch and maybe a leather belt that matches your shoes. Now, tech companies, they usually value creativity. So feel free to express a little bit more style with this outfit. However, you still wanna prioritize looking neat, clean and well put together over being too casual. Even if you notice the company's employees dress down. Now let's get into what I believe you should wear for an educational or non-profit interview. Now in these situations, they generally lean towards business casual, although expectations might differ. For a teaching role or maybe a community-based non-profit, you wanna prioritize approachability and being polished at the same time. For the shirt, I will go with the classic button down in white, blue or maybe a pastel. However, to make sure the color that you pick is an overly bold unless it matches the company's image. As far as pants, here once again, chinos or dress pants in neutral tone. And in some situations, a nice slim fit dark jean is acceptable. Depending on the company, of course. Now as far as shoes for non-profits, think polished yet comfortable. I'm thinking loafers or oxford in black or dark brown. As far as accessories for this category, keep it minimal just like a lot of the other categories. Maybe a classic watch, but in this situation, small pin that shows you support the organization, that's a nice touch. Now what you wanna prioritize with the educational or non-profit jobs, being neat, polished and approachable. Now I wanna give you a few final tips, no matter what the job interview. Very important, make sure your clothes fit well. Clothes that are too tight or too baggy, very distracting. And it's also very important that you pay attention to your grooming. Trim your hair, groom your facial hair, clean and trim those nails. Attention to your grooming shows respect for the interviewer and the opportunity. And no matter what I've recommended that you wear throughout this video, make sure you wear a non-fit you can wear with confidence. The right outfit can make you feel confident and positively impact your demeanor. Now in one of the things I highly recommend everybody do no matter what the field you're interviewing on, do some research. Possible take a look at their social media or their website. This will give you an ability to gauge the style of the company, tailoring your attire to the role in the company culture so that you're prepared, respectful and you're enthusiastic about the opportunity. Okay, so there you have it, exactly what you need to wear for just about any type of job interview. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section any job interview tips you have for the Stalagy family that you think might be helpful to land that position. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the eight style of shoes every grown man should have in their rotation.

        "transcript": " It's time to dive into the world of style with a fun but important topic. 11 little boy items older guys should never wear. Now we all wanna look our best, but there's certain pieces that just don't convey the confident mature vibe most of us are going for as we become OGs. There are some things you might wear that can unintentionally aid you backwards, but not in a good way. That's why in today's video, we're gonna dive into 11 little boy items you shouldn't wear and what you should opt for instead. Because people should be able to distinguish your style from your 12 year old nephew. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Richmond Jackson, salute. Now first up on the list of the 11 little boy items OGs need to stay away from, stay away from the oversized baggy trend. Now baggy oversized clothing that's coming to style over the last 12, 18 months, usually is not gonna work on us older guys. It just looks unstructured and overly casual. And the thing is the older we get, most of us don't have the body of a Greek guy. Unstructured clothing will highlight some of your flaws. And oftentimes this oversized baggy look will make you look like you're trying too hard to be too trendy, too young, or trying to be the king of streetwear in your 40s. It's just hard to pull off this look with sophistication as we age. Instead you wanna wear clothes that fit you well, clothes that flatter your body or more versatile and timeless. Giving you a mature look that emphasizes your style without overwhelming it. Structured, properly tailored clothes offer a streamlined silhouette that you can wear with confidence. Stay away from the oversized baggy trend. Now next up is a style choice you wanna stay away from that I know I fell a victim to when I was a younger guy because of affordability. You wanna stay away from faux leather jackets. Now I know a faux leather jacket might be tempting because it comes across as an affordable way to have some edge. The problem is a faux leather jacket lacks the durability and sophistication of genuine leather. On top of that, that faux leather jacket just isn't a good investment. It's not durable, it's easily gonna start developing cracks, start peeling or becoming shiny. All things you don't want in a leather jacket. This will cheapen your overall look and it will make you come across as trying too hard to look young or trendy. Genuine leather under the hand ages gracefully, develops character, especially over time and will help you reflect quality and an attention to detail. Problem with a faux leather jacket, it's almost impossible for the manufacturer to get it right. Instead of wasting 7,500 bucks on a faux leather jacket, save up for a quality genuine leather one instead. Now next up is a little boy faux pie you don't wanna make as you become an OG that a lot of times happens because you're trying to reminisce that time you scored four touchdowns playing for Polk High. Shout out to Al Bundy. You wanna stay away from weighing sports jerseys unless you're sitting in your man cave or at the actual game. The problem with wearing sports jerseys in general as a style choice is that it comes off as overly casual or perhaps juvenile. A lot of times with sports jerseys, the fit is really what makes them horrible. They're often oversized, loose fitting, feature bold colors and large logos. All things that take away from a refined sophisticated gentleman. They also can come across as you attempting to have a fan uniform, not very polished. What you wanna wear instead when you wanna show some team spirit, maybe a solid color sweatshirt and a classic cap featuring your team's logo. You're representing the Eagles, shout out to Philly. You're doing it in a subtle mature, sophisticated way. Like I said, if you're at Lincoln Financial Field or in your man cave, rock the sports jersey. But in terms of style, lead the sports jerseys to the little boys. Now, next up to me is a fashion faux pas no matter what the age, but it becomes more relevant as you become older. You've gotta stay away from the obvious designer logo. Now, once again, this is a style mistake. As a young G, I definitely have to cop too. I used to go for the logos for the wrong reason and why you shouldn't as an older guy as well. It comes across as try hard, flashy, showy, and it doesn't parallel with the understated sophistication most of us are going for as we become OG. See outfits with large logos come across as overly trendy and too brand focused rather than reflecting your own individual personal style. You see timeless styles often about high quality fabrics, tailored fits and classic designs rather than brand visibility. By choosing clothing with minimal to no visible branding, you project confidence and refinement allowing the quality of your clothing to speak for itself. Now, next up, we have an accessory mistake I don't want you to make that I don't see a problem with a little boy wearing. You want to stay away from a slouchy beanie. The problem with a slouchy, unfitted beanie, it gives off a casual, unkept appearance. And this definitely is not going to align with the refined look you may be trying to project. These hats with a loose fit and extra fabric might work for a younger guy who's trying to pull off an I don't care street wear look, but they would definitely appear out of place and sloppy in a mature wardrobe. Instead of adding to your outfit, they detract from them. What you want to do instead, wear a hat that fits. A classic fitted beanie or well cap with a structured shape is a more sophisticated alternative that not only helps you look sharp, but stay warm and can easily compliment a wide range of casual outfits. Next up, let's talk a little bit about color selection when choosing your clothing. You might want to stay away from bright and loud colors and patterns. Now I'm not saying stay away from color, but in general for older guys, bright and loud colors don't work as well. Broad and bright colors often are going to come off as too showy, too flashy, or even attention seeking, which can detract from a refined, mature look. You see as we get older, a classic guy pulls off style by being subtle, refined. Older we get, the more you want to focus on a polished appearance and soft to neutral tones and colors work much better from us or the guy. Colors like navy, charcoal, olive, burgundy, these offer our timeless look and sophistication. And if you want to add some visual interest with pattern, go for subtle patterns. Think small stripes, checks. These can add personality to your outfit without overwhelming it. So for most of us guys, we do well to leave the bright and loud patterns and colors to the little boys. Now next up is something I'm going to advise, you don't have to leave them completely alone, but you do need to tread lightly. Most older guys need to stay away from the graphic and slogan T-shirts. Especially when we're talking about graphic or slogan T-shirts, they're a little too bold, a little out there. You remember as we get older, the mature man wants to be subtle. So that slogan T-shirt with that pun that you believe is so clever, trust me, nine times out of 10, it's just going to come across as juvenile. I know you might want to project the image of a witty guy, but be witty with your mouthpiece, not your T-shirt. However, on the other hand, I don't have a problem with subtle graphic T-shirt. Ones with a subtle design or pattern, but for most guys, a solid colored timeless T-shirt, well, most of the time work much better for us. Like I said, a lot of times graphic T-shirts or that clever slogan, they come across as juvenile. The exact opposite of the mature, polished style, most of us want to have as we age. Now, next up is a grooming choice that's much easier to pull off when you're from the ages of eight to 14. You might want to try to stay away from the exaggerated hairstyles. Now, get it grooming and hairstyle, a great way to reflect some individuality, some personality, but the foe hawk, the extreme fade, or the overly sculpted looks, it's going to be hard to pull off once you're 35 and up. As you get older and you elevate your look, the exaggerated hairstyle is often going to clash with your new look. It can come across as you trying to look much younger and make you seem out of place or out of touch. The exaggerated hairstyle on an OG just looks forced. On the other hand, a timeless understated approach to grooming allows you to stand out. It projects a look of elegance and wisdom, something we're all striving for as we get older. A well-groomed haircut that compliments the shape of your face and your hair texture will exude confidence and maturity. Now, next up is a style choice that when if I'm out and about and I see you've done this, we're going to have a conversation. Please don't have on the slacks and sides combo. Now, when we're talking about the ultimate, I just want to be comfortable. I don't care what image I project look, this is it. So for my teenage kids that want that, I just got out of bed. I don't care what I threw on look, go for it. But the thing is with us older guys, everything we do should be intentional, including your style. The slacks and sides combo on the older guy is definitely way over it. I'm trying too hard to be young category. They just lack the maturity that a well-dressed older man should be trying to convey. Look just doesn't offer much structure or sophistication. If you want to go for a comfortable footwear option, go for some loafers, some slip on sneakers, or some leather sandals without socks. Problem is the socks and slide combo just doesn't look appropriate almost any place outside the home, the pool, or the gym. We're standing in the footwear realm for our next little boy style choice older guys shouldn't be making. You want to stay away from the chunky dad sneakers. Now chunky dad sneakers, while having been trendy for the last couple of years, add unnecessary bold. And they just often clash with the refined, positive parents. I'm trying to encourage you to have as you become an OG. Know for the oversized soles and their bold design, these sneakers can overpower an outfit and provide a less refined appearance. For older guys, most of us, we're better off going for a more streamlined look. So for most older guys, I recommend a low profile, minimal sneaker. These offer a stylish look without the unnecessary bulk. Chunky dad sneakers come across as too youthful and just may feel forced on a mature guy. Just like with most categories, older guys were better off staying away from overly trendy choices such as chunky dad sneakers. Now next up, let's talk about an accessory choice that's much better left to the little boys or the teenagers. You want to stay away from the backpacks with the bold prints. And when we're talking about a bag for an older guy, the bold print backpack just comes off as too youthful and with the track from that polished appearance I've been highlighting throughout today's video. Bright colors, a graphic design and bold prints are often associated with a more playful look. It just may come across as too casual and not aligned with your current style. Not to mention the more polished your look is, the more bold, bright backpack can detract from it. It can just take away from the overall aesthetic you're trying to achieve. What you want to do instead, opt for a bag in neutral tones and classic materials like leather and canvas. Whether we're talking about a messenger bag, a backpack, a briefcase, one with a more classic neutral tone will offer much more sophistication. So the overly logo, bright, bold patterns on a backpack, leave that to the teenagers. Okay, so there you have it. 11 style choices you're better off leaving to little boys. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section any young guy style choices that you recommend the OG stay away from that I might have forgot to mention in today's video. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the things older guys should wear. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " It's time to get into 11 essentials every guy should have in his bachelor pad. Now whether you're looking to decorate a new place or hoping to upgrade, these touches can make your space more inviting and comfortable, especially if you're looking to impress. From stylish furniture to personal details, we'll get into everything women appreciate seeing at a guy's place. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. When there are those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. Until my returning friends, like Shawn Jones, salute. Now without a doubt at the top of the list what a woman wants to see when she walks into your bachelor pad, she wants to see that it's clean and organized. That's because it represents that you have self-respect, attention to detail, and you take pride in your place. When you have a clean and organized crib, it shows that you're responsible, mature, and you take care of your surroundings. It also will make the woman feel comfortable and secure because a messy cluttered space can be stressful and distracting. Organized spaces are just more visually calming and they signal that you have your life in order which can be an attractive quality. Also a neat environment can suggest your mindset, and it implies that you're intentional and respectful. Not only towards yourself, but also towards anyone who comes into your crib. Now next up without a doubt when a woman walks in your bachelor pad, she wants to see comfortable seating. When you have comfortable seating, it makes your place seem warm, welcoming, and inviting. It just provides a relaxing environment. When you have a cozy sofa or section with plush cushions, it encourages the woman to feel at ease and it represents thoughtfulness and hospitality. Comfortable seating also indicates that you created a space that not only is functional, but you also wanted to be enjoyable and accommodating. Very attractive qualities in a bachelor pad. And well chosen seating also shows that you're ready to socialize, whether we're talking about a get together or in this case an intimate setting. Ultimately comfortable seating reflects your style, personality, and the willingness to set an environment that makes others feel relaxed and at home in your space. Now when that young lady walks into your place, she definitely doesn't want to see a bunch of blank walls. You want to have some artwork and wall decor. That's because it helps reflect your personality, sense the style, and give some warmth. Making your home feel more welcoming and thoughtful. It reflects your interest, taste, and sense of style. Making your home seem not so generic, more unique. Women appreciate seeing that you put effort into choosing pieces that resonate with you. Whether it's photography, paintings, prints, it suggests complexity and depth. Not to mention artwork can serve as a great conversation starter, giving insight into your character and your experiences. A well decorated wall shows you value aesthetics and you've created space not only as just somewhere to live, but a place that reflects truly who you are. Now next up we have something you should have in your bachelor pad that women will appreciate that will counteract some of the coldness a lot of us have in our home. You want to invest in some greenery or house plants. You see house plants add a bit of life and vibrancy to your crib, making a woman feel more comfortable and welcome. Greenery shows that you value a well balanced, healthy environment and you're taking the time to nurture something. Not to mention plants add natural beauty to a man's place, helping to soften some of the rough edges we can have. And it just makes a woman feel more comfortable and welcomed as I mentioned. House plants and greenery on top of that have been shown to improve your air quality and boost your mood, making your place more fresh and calm. By incorporating plants into your environment, you show an attentive detail and that you're invested in creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing home. Now next up is one of the best recommendations I have for you to make your place more welcoming to the ladies. You want to invest in diffusers or scented candles. This is a great investment in your home because you have to realize women typically have a stronger sense of smell than we do. And they attach emotions to the scent. So you have a nice scent in your home and make your house more appealing. The right scent can transform your space, making it feel more welcoming, calm, inviting, and it just makes your crib come off as more thoughtfully designed. You want to choose subtle masculine scents like Cedarwood, Sandlewood, or like a bit of a sweet touch, maybe some vanilla. All of these scents show that you have a sense of taste and a commitment to making your home welcoming and comfortable. Not to mention scented candles can add warmth and ambiance to your place, creating a more romantic environment. Not only does it enhance the aesthetics, it makes your home feel more personal. Overall, a pleasant scent makes your place more inviting, welcoming, and more memorable. Now next up is something I definitely highly recommend. You want to have a small curated bar. This is definitely a plus when it comes to the ladies because it shows that you're prepared to entertain and you appreciate good company. A well-organized bar with quality spirits, good glassware, and a few cocktail tools suggest thoughtfulness and that you're prepared to socialize. And it also shows that you're invested in creating experiences, whether you're pouring a glass of wine or mixing a few cocktails. Not to mention a curated selection of great spirits can be a conversation starter as it shows that you put effort into selecting items that reflect your personal style. You want a well-curated small bar as it touches sophistication and readiness to your bachelor path, making your place seem comfortable and subtly refined without trying too hard. Now next up I have a recommendation that's very underrated, but trust me, women will appreciate it. You want to invest in some ambient lighting. Trust me, some ambient lighting will improve your atmosphere and make your place feel more comfortable, inviting, and warm. Unlike harsh overhead lights that you might typically have in your place, ambient lighting, whether it's up my floor lamps, table lamps, or dimmable light bulbs, create a more cozy, relaxed feel and show that you've paid attention to details, qualities women appreciate. Soft lighting not only enhances the aesthetic of your place, it makes it feel much more intimate. A great thing when you have a young lady over. Makes the setting perfect for unwinding or having meaningful conversation. It also reflects your sense of style and shows that you realize lighting can change the mood. And this attention to ambiance shows a mature, sophisticated approach to decorating your place. So if you want to have a more personal, comfortable, welcoming environment, get rid of harsh overhead lights and invest in ambient lighting. Now next up is something, believe me, women would pay attention to. Do you have a clean, functional kitchen? This is important because it reflects self-sufficiency, maturity, and responsibility. All qualities women find very appealing. A well-maintained kitchen shows you value clean, organized spaces and you know how to take care of yourself. Not to mention this kitchen would suggest you might know your way around a few recipes. And it gives off the air of a thoughtful and welcoming space that you're prepared to cook and entertain. Simple organized details like a clean counter, quality cookware, and basic spices suggest you've invested in your well-being. Such a kitchen enhances the overall appeal of your place, making it seem more comfortable and complete. And it shows that you're attentive to the needs of both yourself and your potential guests. Now next up is something women definitely want to see in your bachelor pad. Quality bedding. You know why? Because it reflects you've invested in your comfort, your self-care, and you have an attention to detail. All traits that women find very appealing. Soft high quality sheets, a quality comforter, a well-made bed. All these indicate that you've invested in creating a space that's inviting and relaxing, not just functional. What I recommend is fresh, clean bedding and neutral color. This reflects good taste and a sense of sophistication and refinement. And it also hints at a lifestyle that prioritizes rest and your well-being. Making your space feel more polished and comfortable. Making your bedroom feel more like a retreat, inviting, and well thought out. Which adds an extra layer of attractiveness to your home. Now next up is an area a lot of guys tend to ignore, but I highly recommend you don't. You want to make sure you have stylish bathroom essentials. These are important because they reflect a respect for your space and an attention to detail. You want to have items like quality tiles, elegant soap dispensers, maybe a subtle room spray. This will help elevate your bathroom, taking it from merely functional to well thought out in design. These essentials will show that you value cleanliness and you understand the impact of small touches. Not only for yourself, but also for potential guests. A tidy, well-stocked bathroom with practical items show that you have an attention to detail and you're thoughtful. Signaling that you pay attention not only to hygiene, but also to aesthetics. These stylish bathroom essentials will make your home feel more sophisticated and welcoming. Now next up is something that will make your bachelor pad feel uniquely you. You want to make sure you have some personal touches. You see having these personal touches in your bachelor pad can show your interest and make your place come off as much more authentic. Having things like travel souvenirs, your favorite books, a vinyl collection. These help show your depth and character and give a unique insight into your expressions and your passions. These small details are very important to reduce the feeling of coldness in your house. This will help your bachelor pad seem more like a reflection of who you are, not just simply a place that you live at. Not only making your place feel more interesting, but also more genuine, authentic, and uniquely you. Okay so there you have 11 things women will love to see in your bachelor pad. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section anything you have in your crib that you believe are left out that the women find very appealing.

        "transcript": " Now, minimalist wardrobe is both practical and stylish, providing a foundation of essentials that make sure you're dressed well with minimal effort. And if you focus on quality, versatility, and thoughtful organization, you'll build a stress-free streamlined wardrobe. And with that in mind on today's video, I'm gonna take you through a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how you can build that minimal wardrobe. So get ready to save time, reduce clutter, and master a simple stylist approach that will have you prepared for any occasion. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your stylist, G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Graham Avis, salute. Now, our first step in building that minimalist wardrobe, you need to evaluate and declutter. This is how you go about that. First, I want you to pull out everything you already own. You wanna put to one side the things you wear regularly, and to the other side the things you don't wear quite so often. Then you wanna take some time to define your style. Think about your lifestyle and your personal preferences. Are you more a business casual guy? Or are you a guy whose options in style tend to be more casual or relaxed? Then the next important step, you wanna declutter ruthlessly. Anything you haven't worn in more than a year, set that aside for donation. Then go through the things that no longer fit. Both literally and the things that no longer fit your current lifestyle. This helps you focus on keeping the things that truly add value to your wardrobe. Then after you've done that, you need to identify gaps. Take a look at your corn wardrobe and see what's missing. Make a list. This will serve as a shopping guide to help you build a well-rounded collection. Now for step two, you wanna choose your color palette. Now when it comes to minimalism, I suggest you stick to neutral colors. Colors such as beige, black, white, gray, and navy, they're easy to match and make your wardrobe interchangeable. Now so that's where you wanna start color-wise when building your minimal wardrobe. Now after you have these neutral colors, then add a couple pots of color. You wanna have a couple of accent colors, ones that are subtle when you're going minimal, that give you a bit of variety in your minimalist wardrobe without overwhelming it. Think colors like olive green, burgundy. Then when you start shopping to build your minimalist wardrobe, stick to this color palette. Get this color scheme in mind. This will ensure that every piece you have in your wardrobe work well with each other and are interchangeable. And this is one of the best benefits of a minimal wardrobe. When you stick to this color palette, it reduces decision fatigue. That's because you know pretty much everything you have in your wardrobe goes together. Now after you've got your color palette down, the very important next step, you wanna invest in quality basics. You see when it comes to minimal dressing, it's quality over quantity. Invest in durable items that will last. Here's some key items I suggest you start with. First up, you wanna grab a well-fitting white t-shirt. This is a casual cornerstone of any wardrobe. You can dress it up over a blazer or wear it casually with your jeans. This is a classic piece that will never go out of style. And then after you have your white t-shirt, I would add a black one, just to give a little bit more versatility and color. Then I would grab an Oxford button down shirt. This is a workhorse shirt. You can dress it up, dress it down. It's ideal for layering, wearing on its own, or having a semi-casual look. After that, I would get a casual button-up shirt. One with a pattern or some texture. Then another foundational piece, a sweater. One in a neutral shade, such as navy or gray. This is a great piece because it can be worn alone or layered as well. Then we're gonna continue to build this minimal wardrobe by focusing on bottoms. First up, a pair of slim fit dark jeans. Now notice I didn't say skinny fit, I said slim fit. This is one of the most versatile pair of pants you can have in your wardrobe. You wanna look for a clean design without embellishment or distressing. This is your ultimate versatile pair of denim. After that, you wanna grab a pair of two of neutral chinos. Think khaki, navy, gray. Now we're talking about an ultimate versatile bottom. Dress them up, dress them down. Get away anywhere from casual relax to semi-formal settings with your chinos. They pair seamlessly with everything from a t-shirt to a dress shirt and everything in between. Then for your more dressy option for your bottoms and your minimal wardrobe, you want a dark pair of trousers. Pair of dark trousers, think navy, gray, black. These add a sophisticated touch to a minimal wardrobe. They're ideal for business casual or semi-formal occasions, making sure you're prepared for more dressier situations. Next up in our step-by-step guide to building your minimal wardrobe, you wanna add some essential outerwear pieces. For the stylish minimal guide, my first suggestion, a blazer or a sport coat. Tell it blazer or sport coat naturally elevate your wardrobe. Wear it over t-shirt, a button down Oxford, a dress shirt. It's a versatile piece to add sophistication to any look. My first choice, a navy blazer. Then after that, you wanna add a casual jacket. Think a bomber, a trucker jacket, or a Harrington jacket. This casual jacket is gonna work well over a sweater, a t-shirt, then I would finish out my outerwear essentials with a wool overcoat. In the colder months, a tailored wool overcoat, I'm thinking camel, black, gray, will help keep you warm and looking sharp at the same time. This will easy elevate your casual looks, but work dress as well with your dressier outfits. Now next up with your minimal wardrobe, you wanna make sure you're choosing the right shoes. Where I might start, a pair of white sneakers. A pair of clean minimal white sneakers are one of the most versatile footwear options you can have in your wardrobe. Then they work with nearly anything from jeans to chinos, even dress trousers. I would opt for a quality pair with a sleek design. Then after that, you need a pair of versatile dress shoes. Think derbies or loafers. For your dressier occasions, a pair of black or brown derbies or loafers are indispensable. And what I love about derbies and loafers, the versatility. You can dress them up, dress them down. Prepare for just about any situation life brings your way. Then after I selected my loafers or derbies, I would then go to a nice boot. Especially if you live in a colder climate, the boot gives you a sleek, warm, and rugged and masculine look that's still super versatile. Wear with jeans, chinos, trousers, even a suit. Then next up, I want you to think about accessorizing thoughtfully. You see your accessories are that final detail that take your look to the next level. Where do you wanna start? Almost every guy needs a leather belt. Think black or brown. A leather belt is indispensable. And what you wanna do is, if you have black shoes, grab a black belt, but you tend to wear more brown shoes, select a belt in the brown family. Then to me, an indispensable accessory, every man needs a classic watch. Whether it's a leather, a metal band, a dressier watch, or a casual one, whichever one fits your lifestyle. Classic timepiece is both stylish and functional. And to me, it adds a layer of sophistication and an attention to detail. Then to wrap up the accessories, I suggest a minimal backpack or briefcase. I suggest you choose a bag that matches your lifestyle and your wardrobe. I would opt for a leather canvas bag in a neutral color. Now, minimalist wardrobe isn't just about what you have in it. It's also about organizing it correctly. You wanna organize your minimal wardrobe by functionality. The first step to doing that, organize your items by category. Put pants with pants, shirts with shirts, jackets with jacket. This makes it easy to see what you have and makes it very simple to create outfits. I also recommend that you use uniform hangers. If you got wood hangers, use all wood hangers. Uniform hangers that match your wardrobe make it look more organized. One of the key things I also recommend when it comes to organizing, consider a seasonal rotation. But I mean by that, I recommend that you store out of season items. This helps reduce clutter and helps you focus on what you're currently wearing. I recommend you rotate your items every few months to keep it fresh. Now, next up is one of the key things I want you to keep in mind when you're building and maintaining that minimal wardrobe. You wanna practice mindful shopping. I wanna reiterate to you one of the key things about dressing in a minimal way is prioritizing quality over quantity. You wanna invest in high quality, fewer items rather than always focusing on buying more things. What you wanna keep in mind, durable classic items made of great materials, quality stitching and timeless design. And one of the things I definitely wanna recommend you do, you wanna try to avoid impulse buying. One of the keys to minimalism when it comes to style is being intentional with the items you select. When you see something you like, ask yourself a couple of questions. Does it match your lifestyle? And does this new item you think about getting serve a purpose? And I wanted you to make sure that you're embracing longevity. When you're shopping, choose items that you actually love, ones that are timeless. You wanna make sure you're choosing things you know you will wear often and are made of sturdy quality fabric. And what's very important no matter what kind of wardrobe you're building, make sure they fit well. This will help make sure you look stylish for years to come. Now that you've been focusing on building this minimal wardrobe, especially if you've done what I recommended, high quality fewer pieces, you have to make sure you're maintaining your clothing. Gotta make sure you take good care of your clothes. Follow care instructions on the label, clean them regularly. Make sure you iron them and store them properly. This will ensure longevity. And just as it's important to have fewer high quality items, you need to replace things when needed. In my opinion, minimalism isn't about rushing to see who can have the fewest clothes. It's not about avoiding new purchases entirely. When you have a piece that needs to be replaced or wears out, make sure you replace it with a similar quality item. And although we've been focusing on building and maintaining a minimal wardrobe, you still need to adapt as you go. Your wardrobe, even a minimal one, should adapt to your needs and lifestyle at the current time. It's important even when a minimal wardrobe that you occasionally review and adjust as your style evolves. Okay, so there you have it. My comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to build that minimal wardrobe. Now do me a favor, my minimal stylish guys out there, let me know any tips you wanna share with the Stylogy family to build a simple but effective rotation. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the shirts every guy needs in his wardrobe. You can check it out right here."

You got to pay attention. And a small sign a woman is into you, that she's leaning towards you when she's talking to you. This is a small sign that she's into you because it shows that she's fully invested and engaged in the conversation you're sharing. When she leans in to talk to you, it reduces the physical distance in between you and brings you in closer. Not only does this signal desire to be close to you, it signals she has a level of comfort when she's in your presence. This will often indicate she has a focus on you as she's creating a space of intimacy. It can oftentimes be involuntary. Signaling her presence and her interests are genuine and sincere. So pay attention the next time you're having a conversation with that lady you're interested in. Does she lean in when she's talking? She might like you playboy. Another key sign that lady might be feeling you. Does she remember small details you shared with her? This is often a sign a woman is feeling you because if she remembers small details you shared like your weekend plans, your interests, your hobbies. This requires a certain amount of attention, care, and thoughtfulness on her part. She's not going to do it if it doesn't mean something to her. This means you're on her mind even after your conversation. And if she's remembering small details you shared with her, she's invested in a deeper connection with you. This thoughtfulness indicates she values what you say and finds meaning in the small things. Those little gems and nuggets you're sharing with her, if it means enough for her to recall them, this is often an indicator she has genuine interest in you. Now next up we have another great nuance sign that chick might be feeling you. Do you notice when she's in your presence she's often adjusting her appearance? Now this is often a subtle sign of attraction because it indicates she cares about how she presents herself when she's in your presence. So pay attention to small behaviors like her fixing her hair, smoothing out her clothing, or reapplying her lipstick. These are all reflections of her desire to look her best and make a positive impression. And the great thing about this, this is often a subconscious way for her to show that she values your attention. And she's conscious of her appearance when you are around. Major keys. And these minor adjustments often indicate she's invested in how you perceive her, which is often a gentle but meaningful indication of her level of interest. Next up is another great small body language cue you need to pay attention to. Do you notice that young lady mirroring your body language? This is definitely a sign of interest because as it shows subconscious alignment and rapport. If you notice her modeling your posture, your gestures or movement, it's often a sign that she has a level of comfort around you and a subconscious desire to connect on the deeper level. And this often indicates that she's attuned to your presence. She has to be to mirror your body language. And this often creates a harmonious interaction that feels natural and mutual. And one of the great things about mirroring a body language is unintentional. She can't control it. So it's a genuine interest level in my opinion. It's a great indicator of attraction and engagement. So pay attention. Is she mirroring your body language? Now next up on a list of 11 small signs a woman might be feeling you. Have you noticed her friends and peers know about you? Now this is definitely the indicator she's probably into you because sharing details about someone with your close circle. This typically indicates that she sees you as significant enough to talk about. This small act shows that you're on her mind outside of your conversations. And because she's sharing the details of your interactions with her friends or family, you have to realize that oftentimes they value their friends and family's opinion very highly. So if they're talking about you, they're probably trying to dig for some opinion. And this will often indicate that she's considering a stronger connection with you. You have to realize that friends often serve as confidants. So if you find yourself in interactions with her friends or peers and you realize they already know about you, she probably likes you. Now next up is something I want you to pay attention to conversation wise. The next time you're talking to that young lady, you think might like you. Do you notice her asking you open-ended questions? Open-ended questions are definitely a subtle sign that the woman is trying to get to know you better. Now when we're talking about open-ended questions, we're talking about questions that require more than a yes or no answer. And when she's asking open-ended questions, what she's doing is inviting you in to a deeper conversation. She wants to know more about you, your thoughts, your feelings, your interests. When she's asking you these open-ended questions, she's creating a more meaningful connection. What she's trying to do is to get to know you on a more personal level. This might indicate she likes you. By giving you space to speak freely, it shows engagement and the curiosity to know about what makes you unique. So when she's asking you open-ended questions, it shows she has more than a surfer level interest in you. If she's not asking only yes or no questions, she might be feeling you. We're staying in the conversation category for our next small sign, a woman likes you. Do you notice she often initiates conversations and texts? If you notice this, it's definitely a sign she's interested in you because she's making a genuine effort to connect. Reaching out first indicates that you are on her mind and she enjoys spending time with you, even if it's just through messaging. And this initiation often can reflect her interest in developing a deeper bond and a meaningful connection. Since oftentimes in this modern world, especially when people are playing games, they will wait and wait and wait for the other one to initiate contact. Her willingness to initiate conversation shows her comfort level, enthusiasm, and interest. So if you notice she will often initiate conversation and texts, trust me, she likes you. It's time to swing back to the subtle body language signs a woman is feeling you. Do you notice she's always touching your arms or your shoulders? By accident, of course. This is definitely a subtle but meaningful sign she's feeling you. If you notice she's always accidentally bumping into you, stroking your arm, this physical touch is a natural way for her to establish closeness and intimacy. Trust me, a woman is touching you because she wants to. In this intentionality is definitely a sign she's attracted to you. Light touches like a gentle pat, tap, or lingering hand on the shoulder, shows that she's comfortable with physical contact with you and she's trying to create an atmosphere of intimacy. On these justices are often done in a way to create an emotional connection. So if you find a woman you're around always accidentally touching you, trust me, she's feeling you literally and figuratively. And that ties in very well to our next subtle sign she might be feeling you. Do you notice she's always in close proximity? A woman who's always around you is definitely a sign she likes you because she shows she likes to be close to you and she feels comfortable in your presence. Especially if you notice she's around you when she really doesn't have a real reason to be. This is a way to make sure you guys have some interactions. She's trying to build a deeper connection, whether it's conscious or subconscious. If you notice a woman is standing or sitting closer to you than usual, it definitely shows she's drawn to you and it shows that she wants to develop a sense of warmth between you two. When she minimizes the physical distance between you two, it shows that she's at ease in your presence. She's enjoying your company. And this reflects an interest in building a deeper bond.

Have you noticed that that woman is interested in your interests? This is definitely a telling sign of attraction because it shows she's invested in what's important to you. By asking questions about your interests, she's creating an environment where you guys can talk about shared activities and experiences. She's inquiring about your interests. It shows she's invested in you on more than a surface level. She's trying to build a connection. This helps your conversations go beyond the casual when you can share your interests, your hobbies, your pursuits, your goals. She's taking the time to understand what makes you feel happy and fulfilled, a major key. In her curiosity demonstrates she's open exploring common ground. You might find out you have shared interests. And this sincere interest in what brings you personal joy is definitely an indication that she wants to build a deeper connection. Now next up we have a subtle sign that's easy to detect if you're paying attention. She's probably interested in you if she's making frequent eye contact. If you notice a woman initiating and maintaining eye contact with you, it shows she has a focus on you. She's generally interested in what's going on between you two. Eye contact is a huge indicator of someone being engaged and wanting to build a deeper connection. Especially if you notice extended gazes when it comes to this eye contact. This is a great way to create a sense of intimacy. And oftentimes what she's doing when she's engaging in eye contact, she's trying to see if your interest level is reciprocated through your eyes. Not to mention eye contact releases a chemical called oxytocin, which is often called the bonding hormone. And of course the release of this bonding hormone will strengthen your connection.

        "transcript": " Now as winter approaches, it's time to elevate your footwear game. And with that in mind, on today's video, I'm going to share with you eight winter shoe styles every guy should consider having in his wardrobe, the effortlessly combined warmth, comfort, and style. From rugged boots that stand up to the elements, to versatile options for work or casual situations, these are the shoes that best combine form and function. So whether you're dressing up or dressing down, these are the footwear key pieces that will help you looking sharp no matter what weather the winter brings you. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, we invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell, and join us into my returning friends like Bernard Barber. Salut. Now first up on the list of the winter footwear every guy should consider having in his wardrobe is one of my personal favorites, the more the temperature drops. I absolutely love and believe you should have in your rotation, dress boots. Now dress boots are an excellent style choice for the winter because they effortlessly combine function and sophistication. Now, unlike traditional dress shoes, dress boots offer you height and ankle coverage, helping to keep your feet warm and protected during the cold or weather. But you don't sacrifice style when wearing them because dress boots come in all the different styles you might find in dress shoes, whether we're talking about an Oxford, a wingtip. You get the same style you get with a traditional dress shoe, but boots of course are just more cold weather appropriate, especially if you buy ones made of high quality leather, not only they give you coverage, they give you durability. While maintaining a polished look that works in almost any situation, I'm talking about anywhere from casual, semi-casual to semi-formal. One of the absolute best combinations of style and functionality for the winter weather, I highly recommend you grab a pair or two of dress boots. Now next up on the list of the best winter shoe styles for us guys is one I definitely will be adding to my rotation and I highly recommend you do the same. You definitely want to grab yourself a pair of lug sole loafers. Now lug sole loafers are an excellent winter style choice because of what they combine. They have this sleek sophistication of a traditional loafer, but with that lug sole, they become a little more rugged and functional, helping you in icy or wet conditions. The lug sole provides superior traction over your year-round loafer, making it safer to navigate those winter streets, but still having that refined, sophisticated look. Especially if you grab a beautiful pair made of durable high quality leather, these rugged yet smooth shoes add a layer of sophistication to both your casual and dressier outfits. Not to mention just like any other loafer, they're very versatile. Wear them with trousers, chinos, jeans. Lug sole loafers give you a stylish yet practical option for the winter weather, and they easily bridge the gap between traditional loafers and winter ready footwear. Now as the temperature drops myself, just like a lot of guys out there still want to wear sneakers. But if you are, make sure you have in your rotation a couple of pair of high top sneakers. Now of course high top sneakers are a great winter shoe option because of course they give you that relaxed athletic look of your sneakers, but they do it with some ankle coverage and added warmth because of the height. And with the design of a high top, you get a great snug fit around the ankle that helps you retain heat and protect you against winter's chilly wind. Not to mention if you're wearing some good leather high top sneakers, they're suitable for light rain or snow while still maintaining their relaxed cool look. Of course the versatility allows you to pair them seamlessly with jeans, chinos, or I'll even rock them with a tailored trouser. If you're looking to stay comfortable in stylish during the winter, but you know low top sneakers just won't get it, grab a sneaker that gives you the ideal balance of style and practicality. Make sure you have some high top sneakers. Now next up on the list is a winter shoe style I find myself reaching for over and over year after year the moment there's any inclement winter weather. And I recommend you do so as well. You can't go wrong with a pair of duck boots. Now duck boots are an excellent winter style option because they're a combination of warmth, comfort, rugged style, and water resistance. Designed with the rubber bottoms and a leather upper, the duck boot provides great protection during the winter against snow, slush, and rain, keeping your feet very dry in harsh weather conditions. And of course their sturdy soles give you excellent traction, making them perfect for slippery or wet conditions. And I also believe duck boots have versatile style. I wear them with anything in the winter, my trousers, my chinos, my jeans. They're a great combination of functionality and rugged masculine style. So if you're in the winter time looking to balance practicality with a stylish classic look, duck boots are a timeless, reliable option. Now next up I have another boot option that's a little more sleek, a little more sophisticated than the duck boot. A classic style that I absolutely love that goes well during the winter. You definitely want to consider having a pair of leather Chelsea boots. Now year round one of my favorite stylish boots to wear are leather Chelsea boots, but they work exceptionally well as the temperature begins to drop, especially the leather version. The leather gives you that durability and the level of water protection that will protect your feet from light rain or snow without sacrificing a sophisticated appearance. Another thing I like about leather Chelsea boots, the Chelsea boot style with the elastic side panel make them easy to pull off and on during the winter. And they also offer a snug fit offering warmth during the temperature drops. And of course, Chelsea boots pair well with both casual and dressy situations, wear them with suits, with jeans, a great combination of edgy style and practicality. You definitely can't go wrong having leather Chelsea boots in your winter shoe rotation. Now next up is one of my favorite footwear options, the more harsh the conditions become during the winter. I highly recommend you having a rotation, a pair or two of work style boots. Love a work style boot during the winter because of that combination of warmth, durability and rugged style. Typically crafted from tough water resistant materials, not only does the workbook protect your foot from snow and slush keeping them dry, they also give you a rugged masculine feel. And many work boots feature details such as an insulated lining or a padded collar to give extra warmth around the ankle. Whether we're talking about pairing it with jeans, chinos or other casual winter attire, the workbook just gives you a rugged masculine stylish approach. Whether you're rocking a pair of buttered Timbs, some red wing boots, or many of the wide range of work style boots you can grab, they're one of the best combinations of style and practicality during the winter months. Now next up we have another style option that combines a combination of a more rugged approach to a traditional dress shoe. You definitely want to consider the option of Commando Soul Derbies. Now Commando Soul Derbies are a great winter style choice because they have that rugged durable sole that gives them a reliable grip, making them very suitable for different inclement weather conditions you might come across during the winter time. But they still have that sleek sophistication of a traditional derby, allowing you to have a dress shoe style during the winter for probably making you feel a little more confident on your feet. Not to mention the open lacing design that's characteristic of a derby shoe gives you a little more room for a thicker pair of socks, giving you added warmth and comfort that of course is very needed during those colder months. Not to mention there's a lot of versatility with a Commando style derby. Dress them up, dress them down, wear them with anything from jeans to a suit and anything in between. One of the best combinations of practicalities and style when it comes to a dressier shoe during the winter, I highly recommend you grab yourself a pair of Commando Soul Derbies. Now next up we have one of my favorite recommendations for men to wear year-round, but they work just as well during the winter. Every guy should have in their rotation when it comes to their footwear, a pair of chucka boots. Now chucka boots to me are the pair of shoes every guy can wear. They have a great combination of durability, style, and in my opinion, casual elegance. Of course they have the added height of a boot, alignment to provide warmth and comfort during the colder months. And when we're talking about a versatile style option, it gets no better than chucka boots. They work with a wide range of looks, from jeans to chinos to wool trousers, making them adaptable for casual and smart casual looks. And what I highly recommend during the winter, go for a leather option when it comes to your chucka boots. Of course leather give you more protection, durability and a little more water resistance than their suede counterparts. Not to mention when chucka boots being lightweight and comfortable, they're great for all day wear. One of my absolute favorite styles of footwear to recommend to just about every guy out there and they come in clutch during the winter months, you definitely can't go wrong with a pair of leather chucka boots. Okay, so there you have it. My recommendations for the eight winter shoe styles you should consider having in your footwear rotation. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section, what your go-to shoe options are for those colder months. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I definitely recommend you check out a recent video I did a few months ago, a great lookbook on how to rock Timberlands 10 different ways.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into an important topic for older guys on the dating scene. The red flags you should be on the lookout for. Now dating at any age has its ups and downs, but there are some warning signs that are especially crucial for you to notice as you get older. That's why in today's video I'm going to cover some red flags that if you recognize them early enough can save you time, energy, and possibly heartbreak. So whether you're freshly on the dating scene or dating veteran, these are the 11 red flags you should pay attention to as you become an OG. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Ron Montague, salute. Now first up on the list of the 11 dating red flags older guys need to pay attention to, does she have an extreme focus on your age? Now this is definitely a warning sign because it can reveal some insecurities or some preconceived notions, especially preconceived notions about your capabilities or your wealth. When a woman you're dating is constantly referring to your age, it may reveal that she has some age related expectations or she might be dismissive of you or have some controlling behavior. That's because if she has an extreme focus on your age, she has these expectations that aren't related to you as an individual, but what she's done is put you in a box. And this fixation can prevent a genuine connection, based on getting to know each other, trust, respect, as she may be more focused on the number rather than shared interests, goals, and priorities. You see as an older guy, you should prioritize compatibility and respect regardless of your age. And if you see she's constantly bringing up your age, that's definitely a red flag. In a kissing cousin to the red flag of an extreme focus on your age is this next one. Is there a constant focus on status and wealth? This is definitely a red flag my older guys need to pay attention to, because it might indicate the woman is more interested in financial gain than actually a genuine connection. You see if what woman prioritizes wealth and social standing over getting to know you, it may suggest that her motivations are transactional rather than personal and looking for a relationship. And what you find out is if you're dating a woman who has an over emphasis on wealth or status, it can lead to an imbalanced dynamic. And what can happen to you, you're going to be stressed out. You're going to feel pressured to live up to these financial expectations. And this would definitely overshadow what you should be looking for, a genuine connection. Recognizing this red flag early can make sure that she has interested you based on truly who you are, not for what you have. And this can help you foster authentic, healthier relationships. Now, closely related to those last two warning signs is our next red flag. You want to make sure you're not with a woman who's always requesting gifts and luxury experiences. This is definitely a huge warning sign of our last red flag. Too much of a focus on wealth and social status. You see if a woman is always expecting luxury gifts, dinners, and experiences, this might reveal she's more interested in a lifestyle than a partnership. And if you're an older guy who's looking for genuine companionship, this can be hugely off putting. And it should be because this pursuit of extravagant experiences puts a lot of pressure on you. You will feel a lot of pressure to continuously fun or keep up with this luxurious lifestyle. It's very important that the woman you're hanging out with, she wants to hang out with you no matter what you're doing. Yes, sometimes you're going to do some hiring things, nothing wrong with that, but it shouldn't be all the time. Dating should be about getting to know each other, not something that's transactional. And mutual respect over experiences is paramount, especially as you get older. And this might indicate the next red flag you need to pay attention to. Does the woman you're dating have an unwillingness to share responsibility? This is a huge red flag because it might suggest a lack of interest in billing a balanced and shared relationship. Especially as an older guy, most of us, we know what we want. We want something that's beneficial for both, mutually beneficial. And if you're around a woman that you sense doesn't have a willingness to share responsibilities, whether we're talking about emotional, mental or financial, this will wind up making you feel exhausted and unfulfilled, trusting. Behavior can easily lead to one sided dynamics. Where you're expected to do everything, like I said, in all categories. In having to carry all these loads by yourself, it's frustrating. If you're having a woman who's willing to pitch in in all the categories we're talking about, that's someone you should be interested in. That's going to ensure you're building a relationship based on mutual respect and mutual effort. Now next up is a dating red flag that's important to pay attention to for fellas, no matter what age you are. Do you recognize some inconsistent communication? And now if you're dealing with someone who doesn't have consistent communication, what this can indicate is a lack of interest and reliability. When a woman is frequently changing her communication pattern, what it can lead to is you feeling confused and it can lead you guessing about the relationship. Nobody wants to be in that situation. Inconsistent communication can lead to a one sided relationship where you feel undervalued or perhaps manipulated. If you prioritize transparency and commitment, consistent communication is essential to building that. And I need you to understand this. When a woman is interested in you, you're not going to have to fight for her attention. She will communicate. So it's very important for you to recognize this red flag early to prevent some emotional strain. And this will help you ensure that you're in a relationship that's grounded in a mutual respect and open communication. And that leads us to our next red flag that's piggybacks on inconsistent communication. You want to make sure you pay attention if she never wants to have deep or personal conversation. Now this is a crucial red flag for you to recognize because it might indicate a lack of willingness to build a deep, genuine connection. When a woman consistently steers clear of deep or personal conversations, she's avoiding building that connection. It's that simple. It may indicate she's only interested in surface level things. And if you're there for the same reason, okay. But most of us as we get older, we're looking to build something more substantial, something more meaningful. In avoiding personal conversations, you can't get to know each other. And another thing, if she doesn't want to have personal conversations, you might have to face the facts. She's not really interested or she might have something to hide. And when you don't have this open communication, it can easily lead to you being frustrated, feeling pushed away. So as you're getting to know a woman over time, the conversation should be deeper, more personal. If not, that's definitely a red flag. Now we're going to get into a red flag you definitely should notice as the relationship continues to develop. Do you notice that she's avoiding long term commitment? This is definitely a crucial red flag because it will indicate a reluctance to invest in a meaningful relationship. And if that's what you're there for, you got to pay attention to that. You see if you're dating a woman, especially over an extended period of time, and she avoids long term commitment, it may indicate she's only there for casual dating, which is cool, but it also may indicate some deep seated personal issues. And if you're someone who's seeking a long term commitment, this will lead to emotional strain and frustration on your end. You see, most of us guys, we don't want to waste time as we get older. We want a long term commitment. You don't want to be the only one making the emotional investment. If she's always avoiding long term commitment and conversations about it, unless you're there to just have fun, trust me, this will prevent potential growth and have you in a one sided dynamic void of mutual commitment. So if you're there for something serious and she isn't, move on. It's a red flag. Now we're going to get into a red flag that's on the opposite end of the spectrum. You want to pay attention if you see quick declarations of love. In other words, you got to pay attention to potential love bombing. Quick declarations of love, especially when you first get to know a woman is definitely a red flag because of what it might indicate. It might actually indicate a lack of genuine connection. If the woman doesn't really know you, why is she's having these quick declarations? It feels like she's expressing her love prematurely. It might indicate she just infatuated, not really into the real you. You haven't built a real connection. She's invested in the feelings, not the true you. And this type of impulsive behavior might actually indicate some underlying problems or even worse, it might indicate a desire to manipulate the situation based on emotional control. Now I'm not saying you can't build a great deep connection pretty early on in a relationship, but it doesn't happen very often. So just like a voting long term commitment can be a problem, so can quick declarations of love. Now next up is a crucial red flag. Only us older guys have to be aware of. Are you noticing she does frequent comparisons of you to younger men? That's a huge problem. You see if she's constantly comparing you to younger men, this might indicate some dissatisfaction or some unrealized expectation. You see if a woman is constantly comparing you to younger men or bringing the topic of younger men up, this might indicate that she idealizes youth or it also might indicate she's looking for something older men she believes don't possess, like certain physical attributes or certain lifestyle. And trust me, these frequent comparisons, what they can do to you is leave the feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt and this will make you feel disrespected. For a relationship to thrive, both people have to respect who you are right now, not based on comparison or age-based expectation. So if she's frequently comparing you to young men, you can't do anything about your age. That's a red flag. Now for our next red flag, we're staying in the realm of disrespect. It's definitely a red flag no matter what age a guy is if she's flirting with other men. This is a huge indicator of a lack of respect and a lack of commitment as well. You see if a woman that you're with is constantly flirting with other men, it reveals a lack of interest in you and a potential relationship. She's not invested in building a deeper connection with you. Huge red flag. And what this will lead to on your part, you'll have feelings of mistrust, a lack of respect, insecurity, all of which are detrimental to the possibility of a healthy relationship. If a woman respects you, she's focused on you. So if you're an older guy who's dating, who's looking for stability, security, reliability, and most importantly, respect, you must notice this red flag right away and head for the hills. You want to cut her off and seek relationships based on mutual respect, understanding, and loyalty. Now next up is in my opinion, one of the most crucial red flags you should be aware of. Are you dealing with a woman who's using emotional manipulation? Now this is a huge warning sign because it might indicate you're with a woman who has a tendency to control or exploit emotion for her personal gain. So how does this behavior manifest itself through guilt trips, playing a victim, or making you feel ultimately responsible for her happiness? That's not your job. When you're in a relationship, the job of both people is to add happiness to each other's life, not give it. And these emotional manipulation techniques can undermine trust, respect, and honest interactions, which are all essential for a healthy relationship. So if you're looking for stability and honesty, this is a red flag that is crucial you notice early on. This can help you avoid toxic dynamics and emotional stress. You don't need that as you get older. So if you recognize you're with a woman who's using emotional manipulation, it's a relationship dead end."

        "transcript": " It's time to dive into how to trim and shave your pubes safely and effectively. Now shaving your pubic hair can be intimidating and a bit scary, but with the right tools and techniques, it's easy to maintain cleanness, comfort, and confidence. That's why in today's video, I'm going to walk you through all the essential steps to trimming and shaving your pubes the right way. Whether you're looking for a close shave or just looking to tidy up, these steps will help you do it safely and effectively. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Edward Burks, salut. Now when trimming and shaving your pubes, just like with any other job, the first step is to make sure you have the right tools. Having the right tools to trim and shave your pubes is essential because it ensures safety, comfort, and effective results. I highly recommend you use trimmers and razors designed specifically for grooming below the belt. That's because doing so highly reduces the likelihood of nicks, cuts, and irritations. That's why I would use my man's skid trimmer and razor. And no, this is not a sponsored video. I actually use these products. And when you have a body trimmer, whether it's from Manscaped or somewhere else, it's designed specifically for that area. They come with guards that reduce skin irritation, but allow you to get the hair down to a manageable length. A lot of times these trimmers will come with adjustable settings to get that length just right. And when I do choose a shave, I will use a razor designed for shaving the pubes. Proper grooming tools with trimming and shaving your pubes, make sure that shave is comfortable, safe, and you get great results. Now, after you've made sure you have the right tools, the next step I recommend, you want to soften the hair by taking a warm shower or bath. When you do this, it highly reduces the risk of irritation or cuts. You see, when your hair is drier coarse, you're much more likely to get an uncomfortable shave as your trimmer or razor will be more likely to tug or pull, which can cause discomfort or burns. So when you lie the hair to soak in a warm shower or bath, it softens the hair and uncauged your pores. Soft the hair is easier to shave and cut, and it leads to less resistance. This also lessens the likelihood of you clogging your razor or trimmer. Not to mention, soft the hair lies flatter on your skin, linted to a closer smoother shave, while it also minimizes the risk of irritation, cuts, or ingrown hair. So before trimming and cutting, take a shower, bath, or soften the hair. It'll lead to a much more comfortable grooming experience. So now it's time to get started. And the first thing you want to do after softening the hair, you want to trim the hair before shaving it. When you trim before shaving, it makes the whole process smoother, safer, and effective. You see, longer pubic hair will clog your razor, making it pull, tug, and making it harder to shave cleanly, which can lead to irritation and cuts. By trimming the hair down to a more manageable length, you're reducing the amount of work the razor has to do. And this helps the razor glide much more easily across the skin, giving you a closer cleaner, more effective shave. So ultimately trimming before you shave leads to a much more comfortable, smoother, and effective result. Now I want to get a bit into a specific technique when it comes to trimming and shaving your pubes. You want to gently pull your skin taut. Essentially what you want to do is stretch the skin. When you do this, it leads to a much more effective job. You see your pubic area naturally has more loose skin. Think around your balls. When you don't pull the skin taut, you're much more likely to nick or cut that loose skin. That's because when you try to trim or shave over loose skin, it's going to lead to an uneven shave. And this uneven shave will lead to irritation, nicks, cuts, or worse. But what you want to do, especially with the testicles, you want to lift them up gently and pull the skin taut. Then begin to trim or shave. This will much more likely reduce the risk of your trimmer or shaving getting caught up in the skin folds. And this will ensure a closer cleaner shave. So remember before putting the trimmer or razor on your skin, gently pull the skin taut. Now when you're getting ready to shave those pubes, one of the most important decisions you have to make, make sure you're using a clean sharp razor. Want to make sure you're using this clean sharp razor because it leads to a more effective, but more important, safer experience. A sharp clean razor ensures a smooth close shave with less passes. And having less passes reduces the risk of irritation, nicks, cuts, and razor burn. See, dull blades tend to pull on the hair and skin, which can lead to bad results like nicks, cuts, and ingrown hairs, especially in sensitive areas like below the belt. Not to mention a clean razor prevents the buildup of bacteria and dead skin cells in your razor. This will lower the risk of you having irritation or infection in your pubic region. So make sure you're regularly replacing the blades on your razor. This will make sure your blades are sharp and you're on point with your hygiene. I also highly recommend when you're going to shave below the belt, apply shaving cream or gel. I'm not a huge fan of dry shaving when it comes to your pubic region. Here's why. When you use a gel or cream, it provides a protective barrier for your skin. It'll reduce this friction and allows the blade to glide much more smoothly. And this can help prevent razor burn, nicks, cuts, and irritation that you don't want to experience in your sensitive areas. Not to mention using shaving cream or gel helps soften the hair. Remember we said earlier, soft the hair, easier, more comfortable shave. Another great benefit of shaving gel or cream, it helps hydrate your skin, helping to keep it moisturized and leaving it less prone to irritation. So what I recommend you do, use a shaving gel or cream that's fragrance free and for sensitive skin. This will help you avoid allergic reactions while still getting a close comfortable and effective shave. Now another technique I highly recommend when it comes to trimming and shaving your pubes, I recommend you shave with the grain. That means cutting your hair in the same direction of its natural growth. When you shave with the grain, this highly reduces the risk of irritation, cuts, and pulls. And it definitely reduces the risk of another problem when it comes to shaving in grown hairs. When you shave against the grain, the razor tends to lift and pull the hair, cutting it at a sharper angle and increasing the likelihood of irritation and cuts. Shaving with the grain on the other hand is a safer and more gentle approach. Now I will admit shaving with the grain won't get you as super close, but it definitely reduces the risk of irritation and keeps that sensitive area much more healthy. Next up is another technique you want to use when trimming and shaving your pubes. If you want to reduce the risk of irritation and cuts, you want to use short, gentle strokes. Now using short and gentle strokes when shaving your pubes gives you much more control over the trimmer or razor, which you need when encountering these uneven and curved surfaces that you find in your pubic region. These short, gentle strokes allow you to trim and shave with much more precision. Also these short, gentle strokes minimize the risk of pressing too hard when trimming and shaving or completely missing areas which can lead to nicks and cuts. Also gentle strokes reduce friction, minimize irritation, and lead to a lot less mistakes, which can be very common if you apply too much pressure. By using short, careful strokes, you ensure a closer, cleaner, smoother, and safer shave, which can lead to being more comfortable and reduce the risk of ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Let's piggybacks nicely into my next point. When you're trimming and shaving your pubes, please take your time. Taking your time is essential to make sure you have a smooth, safe, and effective shave. You see when you rush through the process, it's just going to increase the likelihood of making a mistake, cutting yourself, irritation, and of course you're going to miss some spots, meaning you're going to have to do more passes. You see when you're rushing, you're much more likely to use too much pressure or have uneven strokes. Slowing down, you can much better focus on your technique. Shaving with the grain, using short, gentle strokes. This will allow you to be precise, greatly reducing the risk of irritation, nicks, cuts, and all the other problems we've been discussing throughout this video. Also taking your time helps you make sure you soften the hair, properly prepare the area, and use the right tools, all leading to a closer, comfortable, and a more effective shaving experience. Now next up is a step a lot of guys skip when it comes to trimming and shaving your pubes, and it's a huge mistake. After you're done, make sure you moisturize the skin. You see moisturize at any part of your skin, especially after shaving it, leads to smoother, more comfortable results. And this is especially important in sensitive areas like the pubic region. When you're shaving, you're removing not only hair, but a top layer of skin, leaving your skin exposed, which can lead to dry, irritated skin, razor burn, or bumps. A good moisturizer helps replenish lost moisture and helps soothe irritated skin. It creates a protective barrier that locks in hydration and leads to healthier, softer skin. Not to mention moisturizing the area reduces the likelihood of razor burn and ingrown hair. What I recommend you do after trimming and shaving your pubes, use a moisturizer that's fragrance free and is designed specifically for sensitive skin. Okay, so there you have it. My step by step guide on how to safely and effectively trim and shave those pubes. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section. Do you have some important things you do when trimming and shaving that sensitive area? I might have left out.

Now, first up on the list of the best style tips for dad buys is probably the most important. You must focus on fit. Now, this is extremely important because the right fit enhances your natural body shape without clinging to problem areas like your midsection, or creating overly bulky appearance. You see, when you wear clothes that are too tight, it can emphasize areas you don't want people paying attention to. Overly baggy outfits can actually make you appear larger and sloppy. A well-tailored fit strikes the perfect balance between highlighting your best features and offering a streamlined, comfortable fit. You wanna offer clothing that gently skims your body. Think well-tailored trousers. This will help you create a neat, professional, and refined look. Prioritizing fit enhances your overall look and helps you project a sharp, confident appearance that comes off as effortless. Speaking of the right fit, cause the tip I came across maybe 10 years ago that completely changed my style life. And it works wonders for any dad buy. Start having tailored your casual clothing. What I mean by this is, no, you're not gonna get custom made casual clothing. You're gonna take the casual clothing you have to a tailor to get them altered. This will make sure that your casual clothing has a flattering fit. A lot of times when you buy off the rack casual clothing, it's not gonna fit you right in all the right places. So you take those jeans, take that shirt to the tailor to get them altered. When they nip and tuck them in the right places, you'll notice that your casual clothing can look just as good as your dressier clothing. You see me like a lot of guys out there, I thought alteration and tailoring were just for suits, trousers, and blazers. But once I discovered the power of getting my casual clothing tailored, changed my style life, as I just said. Because the opposite problem is that a lot of time when casual clothing doesn't fit you right, you can come off as unpolished. So trust me, one of the things you can do today to make you come across as streamlined, sleek, and smooth, get your casual clothing altered. Now next up is something that definitely will make you come across as more streamlined and make you feel more comfortable. Make sure you're wearing mid-rise pants. The great thing about mid-rise pants for us dad buy guys, what happens is they sit naturally at your waist, offering more comfort and a more flattering fit. You see if you're wearing low-rise pants or jeans, they sit too far below your belly and they can give you a muffin top appearance, not flattering at all. Mid-rise pants are gonna provide you a must better fit. They'll feel more comfortable, they won't dig into your belly. Not to mention mid-rise pants also will help balance your proportions, which makes you come across as better put together. It gives you a streamlined appearance without emphasizing your midsection. This higher waist offers support and it helps your shirts stay tucked in. Of course this will contribute to a more polished, refined silhouette. Mid-rise pants are both practical and stylish. They make you look better and they're more comfortable to wear. We're not quite done talking about pants when it comes to style tips for the dad buy. You wanna make sure you're opting for tapered pants. The reason for this is tapered pants provide a flattering silhouette and they balance comfort and structure. What do I mean by tapered pants? Tapered pants will usually have more room in the hips and thighs and they taper down as they get to your ankle. This offers a sleek tailored fit without being too tight. And this helps you create a streamlined appearance because they won't come across as bulky like some wider pants might do. Tapered pants also prevent excess fabric from bunching up around your ankle, which can have a bad effect making you look larger. And when you wear tapered pants, it actually has a visual effect of elongating your legs. Giving you a sleeker frame and making you come across is more proportion. Trust me, next time you go shopping, look for tapered pants. They give you a comfortable, stylish and modern look that compliments the dad buy. Now I'm gonna give you one of the easiest tips to implement that will make a huge difference in your style if you got a dad buy. Start dressing up more, wear more blazers and suits. To me, dressing up more when you have a dad buy is a cheat code. Let me tell you why. Because the way blazers and suits are cut, especially the jacket, they give you the illusion of broader shoulders and a narrow waist and it de-emphasizes your midsection. This will result in you having a flattering, polished look that enhances your natural body shape. You see when you wear tailored items like blazers or suit jackets, it gives you a streamlined appearance. The another thing to structure shoulders and fitted cuts of a blazer or a suit can make you appear more proportional and put together. Not to mention wearing blazers or suits just gives you an extra layer of sophistication. The important thing about these blazers and suits is how they emphasize your shoulders and de-emphasize that belly. To me, an absolute cheat code when it comes to dad buys, dress up a bit, wear blazers and suits. Now next up, I'm gonna share with you one of the best style techniques you can use when you have a dad buy. You wanna master the art of layering, specifically layering to define your waist. When you wear things such as a jacket, a blazer or vest, it can help structure your shape, highlighting the best parts of your body and what we always wanna do throughout this video, draw an attention away from what might be an unflattering upper body suddenly slimming the midsection at the same time. You see a well-tailored jacket or cardigan with tapering at the waist, creating an illusion of a better waistline. Not to mention when you're layering, you're playing around with texture and color, which adds depth to your outfit, but it adds depth without adding bulk. By focusing on layers that define your waist, you create a more streamlined sleek silhouette and a tailored appearance that enhances your overall look. Next up, I have another great style technique that can help out the fellas that have dad buys. You wanna make sure you're accessorizing strategically. The reason why this helps is that when you do strategically accessorize, it draws attention to your best features and draw attention away from your worst. And it does this without overwhelming your look. Carefully chosen accessories such as a timeless watch or pocket square can shift the focal point. One of the ones I use all the time is wearing a pocket square with my suit and blazer. The reason why pocket square is a great strategy is because it draws attention to your chest. One of the highlighted areas most of us don't have a problem with. It draws the eyes to the chest away from the midsection. Also, accessories like ties, hats, or glasses, they do the same thing. Bringing people's eyes to areas you're more comfortable with while enhancing your overall look. Strategically wearing accessories helps you express your individual style while providing balance to your outfit, assuring your outfit looks polished and cohesive without overwhelming it. Now, next up is a style tip that might not cross your mind right away when it comes to dad buys because it focuses on an area far away from that midsection. You actually can come across with a more flattering look when you choose the right shoe. You see choosing the right shoes is an important decision because the right footwear can offer balance and proportion to your overall look. What you wanna do is opt for shoes that offer structure and complement your overall vibe. Some of my choices such as loafers, derbies, or boots, these will help guys with a dad buy project a more streamlined appearance. Because what these type of shoes do, they help you create a more cohesive look. And what you wanna do is avoid overly bulky shoes. As this draws attention to the bulk at your feet, it draws attention downward in a way that disrupts your proportion. Not to mention the right pair of shoes can actually add some height. Elongating your frame and making you come across is more sleek and streamlined. Another great thing you wanna do, you wanna make sure that you're matching shoes with your overall style. Whether casual or formal, because when you have a cohesive look, that too makes you come across as sleeker and more streamlined. Now next up, we have another overlooked area for a lot of us dad buys when we're making decisions about wearing clothing. You wanna make sure you're choosing structured fabrics. The great thing about wearing structured fabrics is that they provide shape and definition to your look, enhancing your overall appearance. You see, unlike softer flowy fabrics that can cling to your body and tend to emphasize areas that might be a problem, structured fabrics tend to hold their form much better, helping you to create clean lines. These structured fabrics also define your shoulders and your chest and skim over your midsection. Another great thing about these structured fabrics, they prevent excessive fabric that can bunch up, make you appear larger than you are. Of course, we don't want that. Incorporating structured fabrics throughout your wardrobe, whether we're talking about shirts, jeans or jackets, give your outfits a tailored and polished look by providing comfort and durability. Now, next up, we have a bit of style 101 when it comes to dad buys, but I think it bears repeating anyway. You wanna make sure you're opting for darker colors. You see, the great thing about darker colors, they have a slimming effect which can enhance your overall appearance. You see, dark colors absorb light rather than reflecting it, which can minimize the appearance of bulk and can easily draw attention away from your problem areas. And this gives off a visual effect that streamlines your silhouette and makes you look more put together. Another great thing about dark colors, they're very versatile, easy to match with the rest of the colors in your wardrobe. And they're easily dressed up or dressed down, which makes them practical and timeless. Another great thing I like about dark colors, they tend to come off as more sophisticated, more refined, and which can boost your confidence, which is always great when it comes to style. Overall, wearing dark colors offers a practical, stylish and effortless solution to those of us with dad buys. Okay, so there you have it, 10 of my best style tips for dad buys. Now do me a favor, my dad buys style guides out there, let us know in the comment section, any style tips you might have that I might have forgotten to add to today's video.

        "transcript": " It's time to break down what you need to consider when making a decision between black and brown shoes. Now picking the right color for your footwear is a key element because it can make or break your look. Whether we're talking about going to the office, a formal event, or a casual outing. That's why in today's video I'm going to break down 10 things you should keep in mind when choosing between your black or brown shoes. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, rooming, and dating. If any of your topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Dave Dove, salut. Now the first thing I want you to keep in mind when deciding between black or brown shoes, formality. That's because the color of your footwear can easily affect the tone of your outfit. Here's what I mean. You see black shoes are traditionally thought of as more formal, making them ideal for business settings, the office, job interviews, the sleek and polished appearance of black shoes easily aligns with the refined nature of formal settings. Whereas on the other hand, brown shoes offer more versatility, perfect for smart casual, laid-back environments, semi-formal, or daytime events. Brown shoes have warmth, character, and personality, making them perfect for less formal occasions and outfits. Whereas on the other hand, black shoes are more serious. Understanding the formality of the occasion or the setting is an important thing to take into consideration when choosing between black or brown shoes. Next up on a list of 10 things you should keep in mind when deciding between black or brown shoes, think about the color of your pants or your suits. Here's why. The color of your shoes when matched up against your pants can enhance your overall look and create a more cohesive look. That's why black shoes are much better paired with darker colors, your charcoals, your blacks, or gray as that helps you maintain a classic sleek aesthetic. Brown shoes on the other hand, available in a wide range of different shades, pair better with colors such as navy, beige, or tan, adding a nice bit of warmth to your look. Between brown shoes and some of your lighter color suits or pants can create a nice contrast, giving you a stylish modern appeal. Whereas black shoes with darker colors gives you a more traditional look. Ratching your shoe colors to your suits or pants can prevent a clashing look, can help ensure balance and give you a cohesive polished appeal. Stuff is something I think about all the time when deciding between black or brown shoes that I think a lot of guys don't think about enough. You want to take into consideration the day's weather. You see this is important because certain weather conditions can impact the appearance and durability of your shoes. You see with black shoes they tend to hide dirt, mud, and water stains much more effectively bring their brown counterparts, making a much more practical option if there's rain or snow. Brown shoes, especially the lighter in shades you go with tendons show scuff marks, water, and wear damage much more visibly, making it difficult to maintain and keep looking polished. Also, leather responds differently in wet conditions and dark huge shoes are much more forgiving. If you are anticipating some bad weather, black shoes provide much more protection and require way less upkeep. So if you have any doubt in your head whether you might be running into some inclement weather, you might want to choose black shoes over brown. Next up is something I know a lot of guys aren't thinking about when they're choosing between black or brown shoes. Are you taking into consideration your skin tone? Now this is something to think about because different colors can complement your natural complexion enhancing your overall outfit. Here's what I mean. For those of you with warmer skin tones, brown shoes would tend to work best for you. That's because the earthy hues of brown naturally harmonize with the warmth of your complexion, adding a richness, a depth. On the other hand, those of you with cooler skin tones, black shoes tend to work better. That's because black shoes offer a sleek, crisp contrast to your skin tone. The coolness of black shoes better complements the coolness of your complexion, giving you a sharp and refined appearance. You say, okay, Jeff, I got that. How do I know what skin tone I have? Simple. Do the vein test. Go out of natural light. Look at the veins on your wrist. If they're bluish or purplish in color, you probably have a cool skin tone. If they appear to be greenish, you have a warm skin tone. If you have both, you have a neutral skin tone and you can wear anything. You want to think about when making this decision, what time of the day where I'll be wearing these shoes? That's because once again, the color of your shoes can affect the formality and the tone of your outfit. Here's what I mean. Black shoes are traditionally associated with evening wear, often a sleek and polished look that aligns with sophistication of nighttime events such as galas, weddings or dinners. Black shoes match up very well with the darker tone and subdued elegance often associated with nighttime events. Whereas on the other hand, brown shoes are seen as much more casual and versatile, perfect for daytime wear. Great for outdoor gatherings or business casual setting. Having a lighter tone and more relaxed vibe, of course, brown shoes match up better with the relaxed vibe of the daytime. They just help you have a warm and approachable vibe that you want to have during the day. Sleep sophisticated nighttime, think black, relax, lay back, daytime, think brown. That goes right into the next thing you want to think about when deciding between black or brown shoes. You want to think about the versatility. Take this into consideration when deciding between black or brown because the color can affect the occasions or situations you can wear them. As I've been mentioning throughout this video, black shoes are more traditional. They're a business staple, a more formal situation. Your black shoes tend to be more serious, but that makes them less versatile. The limited range might make them not be appropriate for more laid back situations. Whereas brown, on the other hand, you can wear these in a much wider range of situations, anywhere from semi-formal down to casual. I mean, if you don't see yourself in a lot of formal situations, brown shoes are probably the way to go. You'll get much more wear out of them. They just much more easily adapt to casual, smart casual situations than your traditional black shoe will. So if you're looking to invest in a shoe that will give you much more versatility and you don't find yourself in a lot of super formal situations, you might want to err on the side of brown shoes. Now, next up, we need to get into some style 101, a rule that most people should follow. You want to consider what other accessories or belts you're going to wear that day when deciding between black or brown. That's because nine times out of 10, you want to match the color of your shoes to your belt and your accessories. This helps you create a polished and cohesive look. So yes, that's right, black shoes should be paired with a black belt, whereas brown shoes work with a similarly toned brown belt. And this rule can extend to your other accessories. Thank you. Briefcase, your watch strap. This will help enhance the overall harmony of your ensemble. When these details are misaligned, it can create a visual disconnect in the person who's viewing your outfit. And this may detract from your outfit's overall sophistication. Now, yes, there are some advanced style guys who don't match the belt in the shoes, but that's much better to style experts. For most of us, you're going to be much better off matching the color of your shoes to your belt and other accessories. Now, next up is something that you want to keep in mind to kind of piggybacks on our earlier point about the weather. You want to take an exhilaration, the conditioning of your shoe and how much work you want to do to keep them in condition. Here's what I mean. The conditioning of your shoe directly impacts the longevity and appearance of your footwear. Brown shoes, as we mentioned earlier, especially in lighter tones, tend to much easily show scuff marks, wear, damage, much more visibly than black shoes. So as a result, your brown shoes require much more maintenance. Yes, although your brown shoes are much more versatile, they require a light more upkeep. I'm talking about polishing them more, putting on conditioners that will help to keep them moisturized and free from cracks. Whereas black on the other hand, require a lot less maintenance. As mentioned in the weather part of our discussion, black shoes tend to high damage much more easily. So if you're concerned about having to put so much work into conditioning, you're probably going to be much more saver wearing black shoes. Now don't get me wrong, black shoes still require maintenance. You have to polish them, put shoe trees in them. But when we're talking about which one requires much more conditioning, easily that's brown. Now I want you to take an exhilaration, something we've touched on a little bit when we talked about suit and pants color. You want to think about how much contrast you want to have in your look. Here's what I mean. How your shoes contrast with your outfit can affect the harmony and cohesiveness of it. For example, black shoes blend seamlessly with dark colors, your black, your charcoal, your gray. This offers you a sleek monochromatic look, which is very appropriate for business or formal settings. The more form of the setting, the less contrast you want to have between your shoes and the rest of your outfit. However, pairing black shoes with lighter colors can often be too much contrast and offer a jarring look. Wearing black shoes with lighter colors can come across as too stark. On the other hand, when you select brown shoes, they provide a warmer, softer contrast with these lighter colors. Think navy, light gray and earth toned outfits. This contrast can break up an otherwise boring outfit. That's why a lot of times when people want to be more creative and add a little contrast to the outfit, they'll choose brown shoes over black. Choosing the right color contrast between your shoes and your outfit can complement it without overpowering it. Taking into consideration what you always should do when choosing your style. I mean, style is subjective. You want to take into consideration your personal style. That's because although I've been sharing with you a bunch of rules and guidelines that you want to have when making this decision, the decision you make should align with your unique tastes and style preferences. If you consider yourself a refined, sophisticated, more serious guy, black shoes might work best most of the time. Because they'll help you create a traditional and minimalistic aesthetic. Black shoes without a doubt will help you project a sense of refinement and professionalism. Whereas brown shoes on the other hand are much better suited for my creative, experimental guys. But that's because brown shoes give you much more room for expression and creativity. As we just mentioned, brown shoes can add a bit of warmth and contrast to your outfit, opening you up to some style expression. So without a doubt, I'll give you some great guidelines to think about when choosing black or brown shoes. But one of the most important considerations was your personal style. Okay, so there you have it. All the things you need to keep in mind when deciding between black or brown shoes. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comments section which color shoes are your go to. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the 10 shirts every guy needs in his wardrobe. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " It's time to break down what I believe are the non-essential blazers and sport coats every guy needs in his wardrobe. Now whether we're talking about a day at the office, date night, or just a casual weekend, the right blazer or sport coat can instantly elevate your style. From the classic navy blazer to a bold statement piece, when it comes to the best blazer and sport coats, I've got you covered. The ones that will help to keep you looking sharp in any occasion. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. Until my returning friends, like Roberto Sanchez, salute. Now to kick off our list of the 9 blazers and sport coats you should consider having in your wardrobe, to start anywhere else would be uncivilized. Every guy needs that classic navy blazer. Now the navy blazer is an essential for any stylish guy because of his timeless appeal and versatility. A classic blazer pairs with just about anything. Your jeans, your chinos, your trousers, and you can wear it in a wide range of situations. Some are casual, semi-casual. Business meetings are not out of town or just kicking around on the weekends in an elevated way. The navy blazer gets it done. And the reason why the navy blazer is a great choice, it's a color that matches just about every skin tone. Making it work in a wide range of situations for a wide range of guys. Think of the navy blazer kind of as a neutral that will polish up any outfit. And unlike a trendy blazer, you might grab us a more bold statement piece. You can go to the navy blazer season after season after season. The ultimate blazer that every guys should start with, the no-brainer choice, you gotta have that navy blazer. Now next up on the list, we have the sport coat that should immediately come to mind when you think of cooler weather. The ultimate fall and winter classy. Every guys should consider having a tweed sport coat. The thing about the tweed sport coat, it's a great combination of versatility, elegance, and rugged charm. Perfect for when the temperature begins to drop, but it still gives you that sophistication that you need in a sport coat. And another great thing about the tweed sport coat, it works just as well with dressing up your jeans or polishing up a formal cold weather look. Working very easily with your wool trousers, your chinos, and your dark denim. Another great thing I like about the tweed sport coat, it kind of gives you that distinguished vintage look. Versatile enough for a countryside weekend, but working just as well at a business meeting. The tweed sport coat provides a balance of practicality, comfort, versatility, and style. Making it an essential sport coat to have for the cooler weather. Now of course with the tweed sport coat being the ultimate choice for cold weather, for our next selection on our list, it only makes sense to go to quintessential warm weather choice. Without a doubt you definitely want to have a linen blazer. Now what's something about a great combination of comfort, practicality, and elegance when that temperature is rising, it gets no better than the linen blazer. With that linen fabric that has a nice texture that gives you a polished and relaxed look, but at the same time being lightweight, breathable, and moisture wicking, nothing will serve your more polished dressier looks during the summer or spring than a linen blazer. Great for days at the office during the warm weather, beach vacations, summer weddings, and summer date nights, it gets no better than the linen blazer. The linen blazers versatility allows you to be paired with a lot of different things. I'm talking about your chinos, your jeans, or your lightweight trousers, making it easy to dress up or dress down. The linen blazers ability to maintain style while keeping you comfortable at the same time makes it clutch. Making it a must have warm weather addition to any guy's wardrobe. But what about the times when it is warm, but the linen blazer might be a little too laid back and the wrinkles take away from some of the polish. For those times, I recommend the versatile khaki cotton blazer. Now the khaki cotton blazer offers versatility, practicality, and comfort, but in a more structured way than a linen blazer. The lightweight cotton blazer, although it does add more structure, it has the breathability of cotton. Making an ideal choice for warmer weather because it gives you that breathability, but still gives you the elegant appearance. Not to mention the great neutral khaki color of the khaki cotton blazer, the ultimate neutral pairing with just about any other color you have in your warm weather wardrobe. And another great thing to me about the khaki cotton blazer, it walks that fine line. More polished than the linen blazer, but more warm weather appropriate than your typical wool blazer. Making it an excellent choice for your more polished warm weather situations. The ultimate effortless warm weather blazer, grab yourself a khaki cotton blazer. Now next up we have the blazer sport coat that you want to grab if you want something with a little more visual interest. Some depth, some character. You definitely want to have in your rotation, a textured blazer. Now whether it's about a wool blend, a velvet, or in this case, a nice corduroy texture blazer stand out from your typical fabric you often see in wool blazers, giving you some attention to detail that will catch people's eyes. Perfume of the time when you want to elevate your appearance, but not come off as too formal or stuffy. Different textured blazers add a little bit more personality and some playfulness to your outfit. And despite the added depth and character, they're easy to pair with jeans, chinos, or trousers. When you're grabbing the textured blazer, you're throwing on something that shows you having attention to detail and that gives you the ability to stand out in an effortless way. Rare for evening events, creative office situations. A great way to show some personality, character, depth, and visual appeal, grab yourself a textured blazer. Now next up we have another great selection if you want to take a step up from the traditional blazer or sport coat. But maybe without the texture of the last one, you definitely might want to grab yourself a pattern blazer or sport coat. Now the patterned sport coat or blazer gives you visual flair, personality. Just adding a great bit of visual interest to any outfit. Say for example what I love here, this great tartan blazer. This is a great way to add some personality to what otherwise might be a boring look. A great choice to wear in casual situations, creative workplaces, formal, semi-formal situations, pattern on your blazer just gives great visual interest and once again shows you have an attention to detail. The patterned blazer allows you to stand apart from the crowd but still do it in a sophisticated and elegant way. So when you're ready, step away from maybe the more traditional boring looks. A great way to do it, grab yourself a patterned blazer. Now next up on the list of the 9 Blazers in Sport Coats you should consider having in your rotation, we're getting back more to some practicality. Another one of the best cold weather choices. You can never go wrong with the classic charcoal wool blazer or sport coat. Now we're talking about another ultimate combination of practicality, comfort, warmth and sophistication. The charcoal wool blazer definitely fits the bill. The dark neutral color of the charcoal wool blazer enables you to wear it with a wide range of color choices, outfits and situations. I believe it allows effortless transition from situations such as semi-casual, formal or for that cold weather date night. The charcoal wool blazer, money. And of course, its classic warmth and durability makes it a great investment for cold weather seasons to come. Its structure yet understated style allows you to have an elegant put-together look, whether at the office or a dinner event. The charcoal wool blazer or sport coat allows you to blend sophistication, ruggedness and functional warmth all with one piece. When we're talking about a cold weather classic that works for just about any guy, grab yourself a charcoal wool, sport coat or blazer. Now next up on the list of the 9 blazer and sport coats you should consider having in your wardrobe is one of my personal favorites over the last several years. And I happen to be rocking one right now. I absolutely love the double breasted blazer. I love the double breasted blazer because it exudes style, power, confidence and sophistication. With its structured fit, wider lapels and overlapping front, the double breasted blazer gives you a sharp, authoritative silhouette whenever you step out in it. And I think it's an excellent selection for guys who when grabbing a blazer want to make a bold, polished statement, whether at business meetings, formal events or upscale social events. To me, the double breasted blazer just adds a sense of gravitas and sophistication that the single breasted blazer can't compete with. So when you want to come across as authoritative, bold and stylish, look no further than the double breasted blazer. Now next up on the list, we're getting more into our advanced moves. A blazer to grab when you have most of the other situations covered. I absolutely believe you should consider having a bold statement blazer or sport coat. Now we're talking about a great way to inject personality, flair and attention to detail that bold piece gets the job done. Whether we're talking about a bold pop of color or in this situation, a great pattern like this black watch. This one helps me make a statement because not only does it have this black watch fabric, it actually has a shawl collar tuxedo look to it. But no, it's not from a tuxedo. It's a blazer. It's a great way to add an eye-catching detail to what otherwise might be a boring look. Just like with anything else in your wardrobe, a statement piece keeps the rest of the outfit very unfussy. What I mean by that, paired with neutral colors like black, gray, white, dark denim. To me, the bold color or pattern blazer is the equivalent of a splash of paint on a blank canvas. A great way to show your individuality and your adventurous side. Okay, so there you have it. My picks for the nine blazers and sport coats every guy should consider having in his wardrobe. Now do me a favor. Let me know in the comment section which of these blazers and sport coat styles are your favorites.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into nine powerful reasons why you should stop caring what other people think. If you've ever felt held back by the fear of rejection or second guess your decisions based on other people's opinions, this is the video for you. Letting go of these external pressures is key to living a more authentic, confident, and fulfilling life. So, stay tuned to find out how freeing yourself from the need for approval can shift your mindset and empower you to chase your goals unapologetically. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those things interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Bobby B, salute. Now, first up on a list of the nine great reasons you should stop giving a crap what other people think, it allows you to have greater focus on your personal goals. You see, when you stop caring, it eliminates distractions and external pressures. When you're constantly worried about meeting other people's expectations, you can't focus directly on what truly matters to you. And the mental freedom that you get when you stop caring about what other people think, this allows you to be laser focused, allowing you to concentrate fully on your ambitions without the external pressure of societal expectations. By silencing outside opinions, it allows you to have clarity, focus, direction, purpose. It allows you to focus fully on your path instead of worrying about what other people think you should do. This shift in mindset will increase your productivity and allow you to stay on the path to your personal goals, ultimately leading to what every man should have a more fulfilling and purpose driven life. Another great reason you should immediately start caring a lot less about what other people think, it allows you to make better decisions. You see, when you silence those outside critics, it allows your decisions to be guided by your values and your priority. You see, when you're constantly worried about societal expectations of what this person or that person thinks what you should do, it makes it very difficult for you to listen to who should be navigating your decisions. You, without the need for outside approval, you can think more clearly and focus on what truly matters to you. Clarity allows you to make decisions that are aligned with your long term goals. Very important. Rather than being guided by what other people might prefer or expect, it also reduces the outside noise when it's time to make decisions based on your instinct, your gut. Ultimately, letting go of these external pressures allows you to make decisions with more confidence, allowing you to make more authentic, well informed and satisfying decisions. Now, next up is a sneaky good reason to stop caring about what other people think. When you do so, you waste a lot less energy. Here's the thing you might not realize. Constantly worrying about outside approval, this takes up a lot of emotional and mental resources. This makes you second guess what you're doing and overanalyze your decisions and action. All this thinking twice wastes a lot of energy. By letting go of these outside concerns, you can focus a lot more concentration on your personal goals, ambitions and values. This shift allows you to invest more in you instead of investing all these mental resources into what other people want and what they expect. You might not have a clue how much energy you're wasting trying to please other people. By letting go of these expectations, you become less stressed, more productive and you become more focused on things that genuinely contribute to your fulfillment and growth. Now, next up is a very important reason why you might want to stop caring what other people think. It frees you from their judgment. You see, when you're constantly seeking outside approval, you're giving a lot of power in your life to other people's opinions. Not a good thing. When you release this external pressure and have less fear of judgment, it allows you to live more authentically and you're able to make decisions and take actions without the fear of criticism. And this mind shift allows you to focus more on your priorities, your values, your goals, rather investing so much time and you can stop being limited by what other people deem acceptable or desirable. By embracing your individuality, you create a sense of resilience and security where judgment no longer affects your self-worth. So trust me, if you immediately stop caring what other people think, paralyzing power of the fear of judgment no longer has control over you. Another fantastic result when you stop caring so much about what other people think, you'll see an increased level of resilience. You see what happens when you let go of this external validation. You'll see a strengthened sense of self and a reduced vulnerability to this outside criticism. When you base your decisions and actions on your beliefs, values and priorities, you reduce the power other people's opinions have over you. It makes you stronger and this change of perspective makes you less likely to be discouraged by negative feedback from other people or that fear of judgment we've been talking about because your self-worth is no longer tied to outside approval. And as a result of this, setbacks and challenges don't have so much power over you. If you just need to face the setback on your own, learn from your mistakes, dust yourself off and keep going without thinking about what other people think, you'll be much more focused on your personal growth, focusing on your own path, you develop mental toughness and emotional stability which helps you bounce back much more quickly from disappointments and helps you stay committed to your goals. One of the main benefits I get from not caring about what other people and I think it can help you as well, I find that it increases my creativity. You see when you're not worried about what other people think, it frees you up to be experimental, to think about new ideas, to take chances. You see when you're not so concerned about what other people think about your ideas or your work, it frees you up, it allows you to step outside of your comfort zone which in turn increases your innovation. You see this mindset frees you up from conforming to societal expectations of what other people think is safe, what you should do. This allows you to experiment, make mistakes and explore unique solutions. creativity will flourish in environments where freedom of thought and experimentation are encouraged. By focusing on your own vision instead of worrying about what other people think you should do, you'll find that you'll become more genuine, authentic and imaginative. Let go what other people think, increase your creativity. To me one of the most important side effects in a positive way when you stop caring about what other people think, you'll see a huge increase in your self-respect. You know why? Because this allows you to honor your own priorities, goals and desires instead of always worrying about conforming to other people's expectations. The more you rely on yourself, the more you respect yourself. You see what often happens with people who rely too much on external validation, their self-esteem is low. The validation that comes from the inside is not there, so thus they place more power on external validations. But the problem with this, it leads to a cycle and a decrease of self-respect. You see when you no longer focus on outside validation, it increases your inner strength and improves your confidence level. This autonomy helps build up respect because it allows you to make choices aligned with your true self. Over time, trusting your instincts and living more authentically builds up a belief in your own capabilities and increases your self-respect as a result. When you worry less and less about what other people think, you take more pride in you. Next up is a huge benefit of why you should immediately stop giving a crap about what other people think. You can see an immediate improvement in your mental piece. You see constant worry about outside approval, it's stressful, it's draining. When you're less focused on meeting other people's expectations, what they think you should do, it reduces your anxiety level. When you're constantly seeking outside approval, this is a huge emotional load. And when you stop caring so much, man, it's a relief. Like letting go of these outside pressures, you can see a great increase in your sense of calm and clarity. You think much more clearly, constantly thinking about what other people think. Trust me, it's a huge burden. Stop carrying that load. When you prioritize listening to your own voice instead of outside voices, it allows you to live more authentically with more clarity, more calm, and a huge increase in your mental piece. Now, here's what for a lot of people might be a surprising result when you stop caring about what other people think. Do you realize this might actually improve your relationships? Here's why. When you stop caring about what other people think and show up as your true self, it allows you to have more genuine connections and to have an authentic friendship. When you're not so constantly worried about external validations, as I said, you can show up as you. When you're not so preoccupied with external validation and you can show up as the true you, it allows for a deeper, more genuine connection with other people. And this fosters a lot more truth and honesty in your interactions. And you know what it also does? It serves as a great example for those who come in contact with you. When you're able to let go of external validations and show up as the true you, so can they. Instead of them getting to know the person you think they want you to be, they get the genuine article instead of the person who's always trying to please. Stop caring so much about what other people think, show up as the true you, and all your relationships will get better as a result. Okay, so there you have it. Nine of the best reasons you should stop caring about what other people think. Now, do me a favor, let me know in the comment section if you know of some great reasons why the Stalogy family should stop giving a crap about external validation.

        "transcript": " Today, we're diving into a topic that can either elevate your style or completely ruin it. How you rock your jewelry. Now, whether you're a fan of watches, rings, or necklaces, knowing how to wear your accessories is key to pulling off a polished look. That's why in today's video, I'm going to share with you Ava Top Men's Jewelry, Do's and Don'ts. I'm going to help you avoid common mistakes and enhance your personal style. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics, such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Ray Bennett, salute. Now, first up on a list of eight men's jewelry, do's and don'ts is an excellent place to start. You want to make sure you're maintaining balance. Now, maintaining balance when rocking your jewelry is important because it ensures a polished and cohesive look without overwhelming your style. Striking the right balance means wearing just enough jewelry to enhance your appearance without overwhelming it. For example, you've had on a watch and abrasion on one wrist. On the other side, keep it simpler. This is a great way to avoid a cluttered look. Balance accessories allows each piece to stand out while complimenting your look. It also helps you create a proportional look, ensuring that you're wearing the right size of jewelry for your body type and the right type of jewelry for your personal style. I like this balanced approach because when you wear jewelry this way it enhances your refinement and your confidence. This makes sure your look remains stylish and intentional without seeming excessive or chaotic, which segues quite nicely into my next men's jewelry tip. You want to make sure you're balancing your proportions. Now, this is a key essential because the size and shape of your accessories, you want to make sure they harmonize easily with your body size and your outfit. Say, for example, if you're a larger guy, you want to offer chunkier pieces like a wider watch or bold ring because these complement a bigger build. Whereas a smaller piece of jewelry might come across as too delicate on your frame. Conversely, smaller guys should opt for slimmer understated jewelry. The reason why you want to stay away from big chunkier pieces, they can overwhelm your look. And not only are we talking about body size when it comes to balancing your proportions, you want to balance them according to your outfit. Say, for example, if you're wearing a thick sweater or a bulky coat, you want to wear larger accessories. This will help you create balance because if you wear real small accessories with these bigger clothing items, your accessories can get easily lost and not be noticeable. Keeping proportions in mind with selecting jewelry, make sure you're complementing your outfit, adding style without clashing, and ensuring they're polished and refined look. Now, next up in my opinion is a must rule to follow when it comes to men's jewelry. I believe no man should walk out of the door with a butt naked wrist. Yes, I believe a man should wear a watch every day. Now, to me, a watch is key because it adds both style and functionality to your look. When you're wearing a watch, you're wearing one of the most versatile accessories a man can wear. And I love how it signals sophistication and an attention to detail. Whether it's a casual leather band watch or a timeless metal piece, a watch is one of the best compliments to your overall style. A watch is the elevates any outfit. I mean, whether you have on a t-shirt and jeans or your best suit, it signals reliability and that you respect time, both yours and others. And a well-chosen watch is a subtle yet impactful way to show off your personal style. Now, like I always say, I hear all the time, I can check my phone for the time. But that's not stylish. This is the Stylo G channel. Wear that watch. Now, next up is one of the most important things to consider before even selecting your jewelry. You want to think about where are you going? This is a key thing to think about because when choosing your jewelry, different settings require different levels of formality and jewelry styles. Say, for example, in your dressier or formal situations, this one you want to rely on the cliche less is more. The more dressier the situation, the less jewelry you want to rock. If you're in a formal situation, I suggest no more than a classic timepiece and maybe some cuff links. However, on the other hand, in casual situations, that's when you can get a little more bold, a little more experimental. Remember, in formal situations, you want to be sophisticated and not draw too much attention. In a casual situation, that's when you can show out. You see, wearing jewelry that matches the occasional situation shows an attention to detail and awareness. Overdressing or not understanding which jewelry fits which occasion can make you appear too flashy or out of place. So remember, before picking your jewelry, think about where you're going. And that leads very nicely into our next men's jewelry do or don't. Before picking out your jewelry, consider, what am I wearing today? You want to make sure the accessories you choose for the day, compliment your look, not overwhelm it. Like we mentioned in the last tip, if you're in a more formal setting, you're rocking your killer suit, less is more. But if you have one or more laid back, relaxed outfit, you might wear that casual bracelet you love. Whether we're talking about your belt buckle, your shoes, or other accessories, make sure they compliment each other. Over-accessorizing or mix matching your jewelry can overwhelm your look and look chaotic. You want to make sure your look isn't cluttered, you want it to be polished. So think about what you're wearing that day. Wearing boots in a heavy coat, maybe some larger accessories. A casual sleek outfit, maybe something a little more simple. The key here is that after you select your outfit, then choose your jewelry. Now next up is a tip that I highly recommend for my jewelry beginners out there. You probably want to err on the side of matching your metals. Now this is a good idea because it creates cohesiveness and a polished look. When you wear all gold or all silver, it shows intentionality and it gives your outfit a sense of proportion and balance. Very key. Whereas mixing metals can come off as chaotic or uncoordinated, which can detract from your overall appearance, thus nullifying the effect you want to create when wearing jewelry. For example, wearing a gold watch with a silver bracelet can clash visually. Whereas sticking to one metal gives you a cleaner, more refined look. Also for my guys out there that want to layer pieces, wearing the same metal helps you pull off that look in a non-overwhelming way. Now don't get me wrong, for my more advanced jewelry wearers out there, you can mix metal. It's a great way to show off your personal style, but for most of us, we're much better off sticking to matching metals. Speaking of choosing the right metals, that brings us to our next jewelry do or don't. I highly recommend you choose the right jewelry for your skin tone. Choosing the right jewelry for your skin tone is a great tip because it enhances your natural look and elevates your overall appearance. Certain jewelry looks better on different skin tones, creating a more harmonious and flattering look. Say for example, guys with warmer skin tones, you're going to probably look better with gold jewelry. Guys with cooler skin tones probably benefit from the sleek, clean look of silver, platinum, or white gold. Choose the right metal for your skin tone, make sure you stand out while not clashing with your complexion. It also ensures that the pieces you choose come off as well coordinated and intentional. Okay, so maybe you don't have a clue of what skin tone you have. I'm going to give you a simple test to help you figure it out. All you need to do is go outside in natural light and look at the veins in your wrist. If the veins in your wrist come off as greenish, you probably have a warm skin tone. If they come off as bluish or purple, you probably have a cool skin tone. If you have a mix of both, you probably have a neutral skin tone. Remember, warmer skin tone, you probably look better with gold jewelry, cooler skin tone, platinum, white gold, or silver. And for my neutral tones, you can wear either. That's some of the men's jewelry do that I stand by because it really reflects your individual personal style. I believe you should wear jewelry that has meaning. Wearing meaningful pieces of jewelry enhances your look because it reflects individuality and authenticity. Jewelry with sentimental value, such as a wedding ring or family heirloom, goes beyond merely a fashion accessory because it tells a story about who you are. And when you wear jewelry that means more to you, you come across as more comfortable and confident in your selection. And one of the great things about wearing meaningful pieces, they're timeless. They're more relevant than a trendy jewelry piece. Another great thing about meaningful pieces, they can be conversation starters, giving people insights into who you are.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into 11 surprising things that turn women on. Now, while you might be convinced that grand gestures and physical attributes are all that matters, there are many subtle traits and actions that can catch a woman's eye in unexpected ways. From the way you carry yourself to the small details that stand out, these are the ways that a harem women turn in their heads that aren't quite so obvious. So stick around to discover what sparks true attraction and how you might already be catching women's attention without even knowing it. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, room, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Chad Hunt, salute. Now, first up on the list of 11 surprising things that turn women on is something inside the left field, pun intended. You can catch women's eyes simply by being left handed. Now, the reason why this is a surprising turn on is due to its rarity and uniqueness. You see only 10% of the population is left handed. So if you are, you already stand out. And what it often symbolizes to a woman is that you're different and intriguing. Another great thing about being left handed is often associated with being intelligent, creative, and an independent thinker. All qualities that women can find very attractive. Also, the physicality of watching a man use his left hand, whether it's through writing, gestures, or daily tasks can seem novel and thus captivating. And the idea that left handed men may approach problems differently and uniquely, that can lead to some intellectual allure. So the combination of rarity, creativity, and uniqueness, if you happen to be a left handed guy, lean into it. You might be turning women on without even knowing it, which leads very nicely into our next unexpected turn on. Many women find attractive outward displays of intelligence. Now the reason why this is seen as appealing is because of what it signals. It signals depth, complexity, and the ability to have conversations on a wide range of topics. Intelligence signals that you can navigate life's complexities, think critically, and make assertive decisions. All traits that a lot of women find very attractive. For many women, a man that can discuss a wide range of topics is very appealing because it enables you to have a deep connection, share insight, and perspectives, and perhaps learn from each other. All very appealing things. And this emotional connection through shared knowledge highlights your perspective and your thoughtfulness. Confidence in your intellect, balance with humility, can be a powerful and unexpected magnet because intelligence is one of the most appealing things to a wide range of women. Sometimes when we think about our physical characteristics that can catch women's eyes, we think about the obvious. You know biceps, chest, but what I'm here to tell you that is an underrated part of your body that women definitely notice. I'm talking about your forearms. Now the reason why women find forearms appealing is because they can be a subtle display of your strength and masculinity. You see when women look at your forearms, they often see a showcase of your veins, your muscles, and your physical capability. But it's in an understated way as opposed to some of your larger, more obvious muscles like the aforementioned biceps. And a natural movement of your forearms when engaged in everyday activities, whether working, performing tasks, or lifting, or simply rolling up your sleeves can draw women's eyes right to your forearms. When we're breaking it down to basic physical attraction, a lot of women find the muscles and veins and forearms attracted because they symbolize physical fitness, ruggedness, and hard work. And when a woman is taking a glance at your forearm, one of the surprising things that she'll find very appealing are you wearing a watch. You see, once again, we're talking about small subtle things. Watch is very appealing to women because of what it symbolizes. Maturity, responsibility, and an attention to detail. You see a well-chosen watch allows you to reflect your personal style and your confidence. And it shows that you care about how you present yourself. And a well-chosen watch also symbolizes punctuality, time management skills, and that you are organized. All qualities that women find very appealing. And another great thing about a watch, they're often seen as timeless classic accessories that show sophistication, refinement, and an appreciation for craftsmanship. And as I mentioned, remember, wearing a watch draws a woman's eyes to your forearm. Overall, a watch symbolizes refinement, responsibility, and an understated confidence. All things that make it very appealing to a wide range of ladies. Now let's talk about a personality trait that a lot of women find very appealing. Do you have the ability to take things and strive? Now, this is very attractive because it allows you to demonstrate maturity, confidence, and resilience. When you're able to remain calm and composed and life stressful or unexpected situations, it shows that you're in control of your emotions and you're capable of handling life's challenges with grace. You see, we know we're all going to hit bumps in the road, but a woman is paying attention to what you do when those bumps come along. Are you able to take a beat, assess the situation, and respond accordingly? Are you able to remain positive and have adaptability? These qualities can make a relationship smoother and much more enjoyable. Women often appreciate men who don't get overwhelmed or overreact when there's a problem, especially minor setbacks. This strength of character, poise, and grace shows that you are dependable, self-assured, confident, and resilient. All qualities that definitely turn a lot of women on. Next up is something that will work extremely well for my fellas already in a relationship. Next time you're out in public, make eye contact with your lady from across the room. Now, the reason why this will turn her on is because it's a powerful, intimate connection, but it's done in a subtle and unexpected way. It signals attention, affection, and desire on your partner. And it fosters this sense of exclusivity between you two, a way to communicate without saying a word. And this type of interaction conveys confidence and attraction, and shows that she's on your mind without you having to say a thing. This will create an element of excitement and mystery, and have a look forward to the rest of the night. It can turn a simple glance into a moment that's charged with chemistry. So the next time you're out with your lady and say, for example, she's at the table and you go over to the bar to get you guys some drinks, turn back to the table, lock eyes with her, and share that intimate moment. Next up is another surefire way to turn your lady on. Drag about her in front of family and friends. Now, this is very appealing because it demonstrates pride, admiration, and genuine affection. When you're openly able to express your appreciation for your lady, it makes her feel cherished, special, and valued. It's also a public acknowledgement of your confidence in the relationship, and it shows you what the whole world to know, just how much she means to you. It also reflects your emotional intelligence and your commitment to her, which can enhance a sense of security and stability. And it just will deepen the connection. When she hears you speak highly of her in front of others, it also can boost her confidence and self-esteem and make her feel more connected to you. This type of validation, especially in front of others, can deepen your emotional bond and only strengthen your relationship. Now, next up is a surprising turn on that a lot of guys struggle with, myself included. Can you resist the urge to solve her problems? The reason why this is very appealing is because it shows emotional intelligence, patience, and that you respect her feelings. Instead of immediately jumping into a fix-it mode, make sure you allow her to express herself fully and you validate her emotions without assuming control. This will signal to her that you see her as capable and you value her ability to face her challenges on her own. By offering empathy and support instead of an immediate solution, this will foster deeper emotional intimacy. Trust me, sometimes she just wants to be heard. She needs to get it off of her chest. She doesn't need you to solve it. This will communicate that you're a man who understands the importance of listening. It will also help you create an equal and connected dynamic. If she knows that she can come to you for an ear to listen and if she needs it and expresses it to you, a solution, trust me, this is a turn on for most women. Now, next up is one of the most simple things on this list that can turn the ladies on. Sometimes all you have to do is give her her space. Now, this is very appealing to the ladies because it shows emotional maturity, a respect for her individuality, and strong confidence in the relationship. When you understand the importance of personal time and you're not overly needy or clingy, it fosters a strong sense of independence and trust in the relationship. And this creates a healthy dynamic in the relationship where you're both able to spend time with your friends and pursue your own interests and hobbies. And this level of self assuredness is very attractive to a woman. It conveys a sense of balance in the relationship and emotional intelligence, both qualities that are very appealing. Like the old adage goes, absence makes the heart grow finder. You need to have a great strong relationship, but you both need to have your own life. Now, next up is something that shows sometimes it's the smallest gestures that can turn your lady on. You can simply bring her a cup of coffee in the morning. Now, the reason why your woman will find this very appealing is because it demonstrates thoughtfulness, care, and an attention to detail. And this simple act of kindness shows that you value her comfort and her well-being. It helps create deeper connection and reflects a willingness to start her day on a positive note, which is very meaningful in the relationship. And the personal touch of remembering how she likes her coffee is very romantic and it can make her feel seen and appreciated. It's the small simple things that often hold the most emotional weight. One of the best things you can do, bring your lady a cup of coffee in the morning. Now, next up is a trait that will turn the lady's eyes. That's something we should all strive for. Men or women, never be afraid to apologize. Not having a problem apologizing is a turn on to the ladies because it demonstrates emotional intelligence, confidence, maturity, and self-awareness. Trust me, we all should know we're not always going to get it right. And owning up to your mistakes without being defensive or stubborn, that's a very mature approach. And what it symbolizes to your lady is that you value your relationship more than your ego. It demonstrates humility and accountability. Two things that will deepen the bond in your relationship. Simple apology also shows you want to resolve conflicts in a positive way. One of the important things I want you to strive for in a relationship, I want you to prioritize harmony over being right. In this level of emotional intelligence and openness creates a safe space for your lady. It shows that you are capable of growth and understanding. Now, what I recommend you do, apologize when it's appropriate. This shows a level of vulnerability and maturity that your woman will find very attractive. Okay, so there you have it. 11 of the most surprising things that turn the ladies on. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comment section any out of the box things that you believe catch the women's eyes that I might have left out.

        "transcript": " On today's video, it's time to break down the 13 essential style pieces every older guy should have in his wardrobe. Now as we age, we need to refine our style to make sure we come across as sharp, confident, and polished. The pieces we discussed on today's video is going to make sure you're doing just that. From timeless footwear to classic outerwear pieces, these other items will not only help you look age-appropriate, but still modern and sophisticated. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. Until my returning friends, like Uncle Al, salut. Now first up on the list of 13 style items every older guy should have in his wardrobe is to me a no-brainer. And I happen to be rocking one right now. Every older guy needs one, two, or several tailored blazers. Now the tailored blazers must have for the older guy because it instantly elevates any outfit, giving you refinement and polish. Now as we age, fit and structure becomes even more important and the tailored blazer provides both. First of all, it gives you structure and width in your shoulders and it also gives you a narrower waist. It creates clean lines and enhances your silhouette, making you look better and feel more confident. Not to mention the blazer is super versatile. Pair with anything from wool trousers and an Oxford button down to jeans, chinos, and dress shirts. Without a doubt, the tailored blazer is a wardrobe staple. When it elevates your casual wear, throw on the blazer. When I put together a polished dressier look, throw on a blazer. Refined, sophisticated, and makes you look better built than you might actually be, you never go wrong with the tailored blazer. Next up on a list of the best style essentials for the older guy, I have what I call your grown man pair jeans. You definitely need a pair of dark denim. What I love about dark denim and what it adds to the older man's wardrobe, it gives you a sleek polish option. Giving you that polish to parents will still maintain versatility and comfort. That dark hue that you get with dark denim, it pairs expertly with an Oxford button down. Sweaters, can rely on you to create smart and stylish ensembles with ease. You see, unlike your lighter or medium-washed jeans, dark denim has a more refined and mature look, something we're going for as we get older. And you'll find your dark denim works in a much wider variety of situations than your lighter washes. Another great thing about your dark denim, it tends to have a slimming effect. So it's flattering on all body types and ages. A great investment that provides you a modern and timeless look. The grown man pair jeans, dark denim. Now, next up on the list is my favorite piece of outerwear and one I believe every older guy should have in his rotation. You definitely want to have a nice overcoat. Now, the overcoat is an essential piece for the older man because it gives you elegance, comfort, warmth, and practicality. Its classic design gives you a sophisticated and timeless look. They enable you to dress up your more casual looks, but looks just as good with your suits. A well-fitted overcoat just instantly elevates any outfit. It gives you a nice streamlined silhouette which enhances your appearance, but it also adds a refined touch to your overall style. Now, when it comes to me and overcoats, I wear them with just about anything. Over a suit, over a hoodie. With jeans, trousers, chinos, you name it. For the older guy, a great fitting overcoat is a smart choice, providing you warmth and coverage, but in a sophisticated, smooth way. Now, when it comes to us older guys, we understand the importance of the final details. That's what I believe every older guy should own a timeless watch. Now, notice I didn't say expensive, I said timeless. To me, the classic watch is a no-brainer. It's the best combination of an accessory that provides style, sophistication, and practicality. Now, as I always hear, I don't need to check my watch for the time I have my phone. Remember, this is a style channel. It looks better when you check that timeless watch. And the classic watch just exudes a sense of refinement, sophistication, and maturity, which we all should be going for as we get older. It's just appropriate for any situation, whether we're talking about jeans and t-shirts to your killer blazer. And what I love about the classic watch is it serves as a symbol of your personality, your taste, and your attention to detail. And it shows you appreciate craftsmanship and tradition. For older guys, the timeless watch is not only a functional piece, but a touch that adds sophistication, polish, and character to your look. No older guys should walk around with an empty wrist. Next up is one of my favorite pieces on this list that goes very well in an older guy's wardrobe. I highly recommend you grab yourself one, two, or several cashmere sweaters. Now, to me, the cashmere sweater is a key piece to an older guy's wardrobe because of its great blend of luxury, comfort, and practicality. Cashmere is renowned for its softness, warmth, and lightweight feel, making it a comfortable yet elegant choice for the cooler months. You see cashmere with its fine texture elevates even the most casual of outfits, giving you a refined polished appearance that is appropriate for both casual and formal settings. Now, when it comes to the cashmere sweater, very versatile. Pairs well with your jeans, your chinos, your trousers, adding effortless elegance to any outfit. On top of that, over time, the more you wear your cashmere, it becomes even softer, making it even more comfortable, enjoyable to wear. And a well-fitted cashmere sweater also enhances your silhouette, giving you a very flattering appearance. Elevate your wardrobe with a stylish, lightweight practicality. You never can go wrong with cashmere sweaters. Now, next up on our list, we have one of my top recommendations when it comes to footwear for the older guy. You definitely can utilize dress boots. Now, the reason why I love dress boots for the older guy, they're one of the best combinations of practicality, style, and durability. Because dress boots come in all the different styles of dress shoe might come, they have the extra coverage and protection of a boot. They will allow you to have a refined polished look throughout the year. I find they're especially great for transitional season. And just like your dress shoe, they work in a wide range of situations, from semi-casual all the way up to formal. I absolutely love dress boots. I wear them with my suits, my trousers, my dark denim. If you're a guy who wants to dress up but want to still maintain a bit of ruggedness, the dress boot is for you. A great way to have a mature, sophisticated look to your wardrobe, but at the same time, they maintain a timeless, and durable appeal. You never can go wrong with dress boots. Time to go back to the finishing touches that take your style to the next level. I strongly believe every older guy needs a signature scent. Now the signature scent in my opinion is essential for the older guy because it enhances your personal style and allows you to leave a lasting impression. As we become older, I believe a distinct memorable scent carries even more weight. It allows you to cultivate a distinct individual style that shows off your personality. A well-chosen fragrance reflects not only your personality, but your confidence and your eye for detail. And one of the things we want to do as we get older, we still want to stand out. We want to do it in a subtle way. A signature scent allows just that. But the great thing about a signature scent, it acts as an individual accessory that enhances any outfit you have on, from casual to formal. Also for the older guy, the signature scent symbolizes maturity, class, and care. All things that we want to get across as we become old geez. If you want to effortlessly leave a lasting impression wherever you go, make sure you've chosen a signature scent. One of the lists is what I believe is one of the most simple but effective pieces you can have in your wardrobe. Older guy or any age, you definitely want to have several polo shirts. Now the polo shirt is an essential part of your wardrobe because of how it perfectly blends comfort, style, and versatility. The great thing about polo shirts, they offer a polished yet relaxed look. Just as comfortable as your favorite t-shirt, but definitely a much more refined choice. The structure of the collar as it's such a refinement and sophistication that you just won't get in your t-shirt. And then without a doubt, the polo shirt works in a wide range of situations. Weathers with shorts, denim. The polo shirt goes just about anywhere you need to go during the warmer months. And not to mention usually made of a breathable lightweight cotton, not only are they polished, they're comfortable. For the older guy, a well-fitted polo shirt offers you a timeless, sophisticated, smart, clean appearance that takes you all throughout your warmer weather situations. Now next up on the list of 13 style essentials every older guy should have in his wardrobe, we're going back to the footwear department and one of my most recommended pieces. You definitely want to have a couple of pair of minimal sneakers. I absolutely love the minimal sneaker for his OGs. It allows you to have a nice, relaxed, athletic feel, but in a more polished way. Your minimal sneaker with minimal design and a nice low profile gives you a much sleeker, polished, age-appropriate appearance. Then your overly trendy sneakers that will make you look like you're trying too hard or you're coming across as too young. And they work well in such a wide range of situations. Give you a smart casual option, whether we're talking about your jeans or as an effective way to dress down a suit. The minimal sneaker is that versatile. And not to mention when you invest in a nice, high quality pair of minimal sneakers, their minimal time is designed. Meaning as long as you take good care of them, you'll be able to wear them for years and years. If you want to grab the grown man pair of sneakers, look no further than the minimal sneaker. Now next up on the list is something that if you've watched this channel for any amount of time, you knew this was coming. Every older guy needs in their wardrobe, chinos. Now say it with me, chinos are what? The Swiss Army Knife of Pants. They're that versatile. More dressy than your favorite pair of jeans, but not as stuffy as your pair of trousers. Their tailored fit and lightweight pill makes the money for the older guy. Winner with sneakers, boots, loafers. Not to mention there's one of the best alternatives when you know jeans just won't cut it. Chinos just work well in a wide range of settings, from casual to semi-casual. And another thing I love about chinos, they come in such a wide range of colors. When a neutral color that's easy to pair, you can find chinos that do that. But what I also like to do as the temperature rises, I may select chinos with a pop of color. Another great thing about chinos for us older guys, they give us a refined, polished look without sacrificing comfort. We're not quite talking about pants when it comes to wardrobe essentials for the older guy. You definitely still need your wool trousers. Now to me, nothing screams durability, sophistication and comfort like a nice tailored pair of wool trousers. The great thing about wool trousers, wool is a great temperature regulating fabric, making it suitable for just about year round wear. The thing about these wool trousers, they give you a refined, polished silhouette. An appearance that easily enhances any outfit. I throw my wool trousers on with a blazer, dress shirts, sweaters, oxford button downs, you name it. The wool trousers just gives a sophisticated touch to any situation. Not to mention their classic design and time of appeal makes them a worthwhile investment. When we're talking about a pair of pants that's smart, sophisticated, refined and age appropriate, look no further than your classic wool trousers. Now one of the key things I like to have in all my wardrobe pieces for my older guys is versatility. And as we go back to the footwear section, almost nothing is more versatile than this choice. I highly recommend you grab loafers. To me loafers might be the best combination of style, practicality and comfort. Of course with their slip on design loafers are easy to put on and take off. Even though they have a slip on design, it takes nothing away from the refinement and sophistication. And their great balance of comfort, style and sophistication makes them very wearable for wide range of situations. I'm talking about anywhere from your shorts to your suits and anything in between. The loafer gets it done. They just have that nice timeless aesthetic that pairs well with just about everything. The loafer in my opinion provides the perfect balance between refined and relaxed when it comes to shoes. Relax, sophisticated, practical and timeless, I highly recommend every older guy needs one or two pair of loafers. Next up on the list is what I believe helps set the older guy apart. Especially in these days when everybody's dressing more casual. I still highly recommend every older guy have at least one killer suit. Now to me the killer suit is a must have for us older guys because it's a perfect combination of sophistication, maturity. It just gives you a confident time and style. Nothing looks better on an older guy than a tailored suit. Give you those nice broad structured shoulders, the narrow waist and one of the key things I love about a suit, it's easy to wear. You don't have to think about what goes with it. The jacket and the pants, they always match. And one thing I love about wearing suits, especially nowadays, we wear them because we want to because we want to give off the impression of refinement, sophistication, polish. To me it's much more fun to wear a suit nowadays than it used to be because I'm choosing to. Nothing makes a man, especially an older man, look more put together than that killer suit. Okay, so there you have it. My recommendations of the 13 style essentials every older guy should have in his wardrobe. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section if you believe there's a must have for the OGs, I might have forgotten to put in the video. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about 10 things older guys should never wear during the fall.

        "transcript": " Now from what I've observed, it seems to be a lot of confusion about what a simp really is. If you watch YouTube videos like this, there doesn't seem to be a lot of nuance in the discussion. That's what I'm gonna talk to you about on today's video. Now let me tell you first up, being interested in what women are interested in, pursuing a meaningful relationship with a woman, being a gentleman, none of that makes you a simp. However, in engaging in relationships where you're constantly seeking the approval of women at the expense of your own needs, that might make you a simp. So that's what we're gonna discuss on today's video. I'm gonna go into depth on how you can know if you're a simp or at least behaving like one. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, room, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Mario Green, salute. Now first up on our list is a telltale sign you might be behaving like a simp. Are you pedestalizing women? Pedestalizing women is a clear sign of simp behavior because it involves placing someone on an unrealistic elevated status at the expense of your own self-worth. When you place a woman on a pedestal, you view her as flawless and hit her with some excessive admiration, especially admiration she may not have earned, which may lead to you overcompensating with attention, lavish gifts, or favors just to gain her attention. Without a doubt, this behavior reflects a lack of self-respect. When you elevate someone to a status they haven't earned and prioritize her validation, you're doing this at the expense of your own needs and desire. And then it creates an unhealthy dynamic where you may ignore red flags and poor treatment just to stay in her good graces. Remember, a woman you're dealing with, she's not above or below you. You wanna have a relationship that's based on mutual respect and mutual admiration. Another way you might wanna analyze your behavior to see if you're behaving like a simp, are you making yourself overly available? This is a sign of simpish behavior because it shows you're willing to drop everything for someone else, often at the expense of your own values, priorities, boundaries, and personal growth. When you make yourself overly available in romantic relationships, it's a sign of desperation and a fear of losing that person. And it will often lead to a lack of balance in the relationship. You're always making all this effort to be there for her and it's not reciprocated. Your action, time, and energy are dictated by her needs, wants, and desire. In the long run, this behavior is gonna lead to some diminished self-respect and respect from her. And trust me, being overly available, that's a good way to make a woman take you for granted. Healthy relationships require mutual effort, mutual respect, you also need your own life and space. You don't wanna involve yourself in one-sided attention. You're making yourself available in a way that compromises your life. That's simpish behavior. And that's the kissing cousin of this next behavior you wanna be on the lookout for. Are you having problems setting boundaries? If you don't set boundaries, you might be behaving like a simp because it reflects you may lack self-respect and assertiveness. When you don't set clear limits on what's acceptable behavior from someone else, this allows others to take advantage of your kindness. That's simpish behavior. This can lead to you being overly accommodating, and saying yes to things you really don't want to, even when it's inconvenient or detrimental to you. One of the things I say on this channel over and over and over, everybody needs to understand the power of one of the shortest words in the English language. No, failure to set boundaries means you're more likely to accept mistreatment or neglect your own needs at the service of her needs. In healthy relationships, boundaries are necessary for mutual respect and both people's values are recognized and honored. Now, one of the things you want to pay attention to if you're concerned about simpish behavior, do you find yourself always avoiding conflict? This is a bad sign because it can reflect a fear of standing up for yourself or expressing your true feelings. When you're constantly avoiding disagreements or difficult conversations, what you're doing is, you're likely prioritizing comfort over your own wellbeing. This often results in suppressing your own needs, opinions, desires, and boundaries to avoid upsetting her. Over time, this behavior can cause resentment from you. It's not natural to never have a disagreement and it leads to you having dissatisfaction and not being your true authentic assertive self. Healthy relationships require open communication and occasional conflict to resolve the issue. Avoiding conflict entirely, that's a huge problem. It often comes from a place of insecurity, a lack of self-respect, and self-worth. So if you find yourself avoiding conflict at all costs, you might be behaving like a simpish. And that's closely related to the next issue I want you to be paying attention to. Do you find yourself always agreeing with a woman? This is a huge problem because it can reflect a lack of individuality and self-confidence. When you find yourself always agreeing with someone else and it goes against your opinions, personal beliefs, and values, you're prioritizing their approval over your own authenticity. That's a huge problem. And you will find this reflected in your behavior when you find yourself overly eager to please. By never voicing your true opinion or standing up for yourself, you're gonna lose self-respect and the respect of her. Trust me, no woman is gonna long-term be interested in a pushover. And this can easily create an unbalanced dynamic in a relationship where her needs, thoughts, and opinions are always prioritized over yours. Yes, it's okay to be agreeable, but you don't always have to agree. Another behavior you wanna be on the lookout for if you're concerned you're acting like a simp, do you find yourself over apologizing? Now this is a problem because it often reveals a tendency to take unnecessary blame and you diminish your own self-worth. You find yourself constantly apologizing for things that aren't your fault or don't require an apology in the first place. It can signal insecurity and a fear of disapproval from other people. And this excessive need for approval from other people can make you come across as weak or submissive. No woman is turned on by that. And trust me, in the long run, this will undermine your confidence and your self-respect. And over apologizing once again creates what you don't want, an unbalanced dynamic. When you're constantly trying to make men's for things you haven't done, things that aren't your fault, an effort to appease that woman, even when it's not warranted. Now hear me clearly, I'm not saying you shouldn't take accountability when you're wrong, when you make a mistake. A man takes true accountability, but that doesn't require you to apologize for things you haven't done. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect, mutual accountability, without you excessively seeking forgiveness when you don't need it. Now next up is probably one of the most stereotypical signs you're behaving like a sin. Do you find yourself engaging in financial over compensation? What do I mean by that? Do you find yourself excessively spending money on gifts, dinners, or lavish signs of generosity? What you're really trying to do is buy attention, affection, or approval without a genuine connection. This behavior definitely reveals insecurity and you'd rather try to gain someone's approval through financial means instead of doing it from a position where you might feel you don't measure up. You might think you have a lack of personality. And trust me, this overcompensation financially will lead to a very unhealthy dynamic, where you are often taken for granted or you're dressed attracting women who are there for material gain. True respect, effect, and attention to relationships are not based on financial compensation. They're based on mutual care, understanding, respect, and appreciation. You wanna connect with the woman based on values, priorities, and a true genuine connection. You're not gonna have a healthy relationship if you engage in a financial overcompensation. Next up is something that's hugely important you're paying attention to. Do you find yourself not realizing you're in a friend's zone? This is a sign of simplest behavior because it involves you investing time, energy, and effort into a one-sided relationship. In the host that over time it would develop into a romantic relationship, then let me tell you, 99.9% of the time, it won't. And this often happens when you prioritize someone else's needs, wants, and desires above your own. It blinds you, gives you tunnel vision. You'll find yourself offering constant support, being overly available, in the hopes that your effort will lead to something more than a friendship. And she's not thinking that. You're just a friend to her. If you have a female friend you're romantically interested in, be direct and tell her. Tell her in no uncertain terms. And if the feelings aren't mutual, it's time to bounce. Now one of the character traits that may exhibit itself in simplest behavior, do you have a fear of being alone? This is a problem because it often will drive you to stay in a relationship that's unbalanced, unfulfilling, and unhealthy, just so you can avoid being lonely. And I get it, this is a human thing. No one wants to be lonely, but it can lead to behavior like this. You'll find yourself settling for less than you deserve because you're prioritizing company over yourself respect, over your own values, priorities, and wellbeing. And what often may happen when you have a fear of being alone, you'll tolerate disrespect, neglect, or some emotional unavailability, just to say you have somebody and leads to unhealthy relationship dynamics where you're less than fulfilled. Instead of doing it out of fear of being alone, you want to cultivate a relationship based on mutual respect, care, and admiration. And this will help build up your self confidence. And this confidence comes from embracing your independence, not fearing it. A lot of what we've been talking about in today's video is a sign of this big problem that leads to simplest behavior. It often comes from a lack of self-confidence. You see this lack of self-confidence often reveals itself in simplest behavior because you're prioritizing others' needs, and more importantly, that validation at the expense of your own self-respect and work. When you don't know your own worth, you may feel compelled to go out of your way to ignore your boundaries and priorities to gain the approval and acceptance of a woman. And this behavior, as we've expressed throughout this video, leads to you being overly accommodating, always deferring to other people, and failing to express your true feelings and opinion. And as I've tried to emphasize throughout this video, this type of behavior creates unhealthy, unbalanced relationship dynamics. And it puts you in a position where your happiness relies on external validation instead of your self-worth. One of the most important things you need to analyze when it comes to considering if you're engaging in simplest behavior, are you realizing you have a lack of self-confidence? Okay, so there you have it. 10 of the best ways to know if you're engaging in simplest behavior. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section. If there's some simps signs you feel, I left out.

Now, if you've ever noticed that your fragrance starts to fade throughout the day, you're not alone. That's why on today's video, I'm going to share with you nine effective ways to make sure your cologne remains vibrant all throughout the day. I know that a great cologne can cost a pretty penny. That's why I'm going to make sure you get the most for your money. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeffy Stylo G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics like style, room, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Sean Tracy, salut. Now, first up on the list of nine of the best ways to make your cologne last longer is when to apply it. One of the best times right after you take a shower. The reason why your cologne will last longer after applying it when you get out of the shower is because after you shower, your skin is clean and hydrated and your pores are unclogged. Now, there's a comment that when you're clean, your pores are open, but pores don't open and close. But what does happen when you don't have the dirt and grime in your pores, your pores can better accept and absorb the fragrance. Not to mention, after you take a shower, the moisture on your skin helps lock in the scent, making it last throughout the day. Another great thing about applying cologne after you get out of the shower, clean skin doesn't have any of the odors, dirt, and oils that may interfere with your fragrance. And here's how you can maximize the effect. Right after you get out of the shower, lightly towel dry and then spray your cologne onto your post points like your wrist, behind your ears, or the base of your neck. The combination of clean hydrated skin and targeted application of your fragrance will make it last longer and longer. Now, applying your cologne right after you get out of the shower utilizes this next point. Your cologne will last longer throughout the day when your skin is moisturized. That's why one of the best hacks to get more longevity out of your fragrance, apply your cologne after you apply a lotion to your skin. Fragrance cleans the hydrated skin, which locks in the scent and it evaporates less quickly, making it last longer. Dry skin, on the other hand, absorbs your cologne much more quickly, causing your cologne to dissipate faster. What I recommend you do on most days, apply an unscented lotion before you apply a cologne because the lotion acts as a barrier, allowing your cologne to stay on the surface of your skin much longer, thus lasting longer. Properly moisturize skin, make sure your cologne is fresh and lasts much longer throughout the day. Moisturize, then apply. Now, next up is a fragrance hack I've been using for a long time to get the best out of my cologne. What you want to do is layer with similar products. What do I mean? You want to use other grooming products that match the scent profile of your cologne. I'm talking about your body wash, your lotion, or even your deodorant. When you use these products that have a similar scent profile, it helps you build a consistent fragrance base that will last throughout the day. What I found when you layer these matching products, your fragrance becomes more robust and it automatically becomes a longer lasting scent. In a simple way, you do it. You don't have to use the exact same fragrance. If you're wearing a nice warm woody cologne, use a lotion or body wash with a similar scent. This will help your cologne create a cohesive aroma that will last throughout the day. Not to mention this technique prevents scent interference. When you use other products that clash with your cologne, whether the best ways to enhance your fragrance layer with matching product. Now, next up is one of the best creative ways to make your cologne last longer. You want to try a technique called scent blending. This is one of the most effective and fun ways to make your fragrance last longer. What is scent blending? When you blend different fragrances to enhance your main fragrance, you create a unique scent profile that can prolong the main cologne you're wearing. Here's how this can work, especially during the warmer months when I'm wearing lighter fresher crisp colognes. Say, for example, this Dolce & Gabbana light blue. I'll get a little bit of a woody cologne and maybe do a mixture of like three fourths, the light blue and one fourth of this jazz club. The warm woody notes in the jazz club enhance the light crisp scent and these warm woody notes in the jazz club help anchor the crisp citrusy scent in the light blue. Not to mention the mixture gives you a unique scent that other people won't have. Customizing the scent, strength and lasting power. And it's a great way to get more enjoyment and longevity out of your fragrances. Now, my next tip on how to make your cologne last longer gets back to the basics. Where you apply it. You want to apply your fragrance to your post points. What are post points? These are areas of your skin where the blood vessels are closer to the surface, emitting warmth and it enhance the projection of your cologne out into the world, making it more noticeable without you having to over apply your fragrance. Examples of your post points behind your ears, the base of your neck, your chest, your inner elbows. These are all areas that emit heat and diffuse and amplify your cologne throughout the day. Also, applying cologne to your post points allows the scent to interact with your body's natural chemistry as it was designed, providing a more personalized and longer lasting effect. So the main point of this tip, don't apply your cologne willy nilly. Apply it directly and target it to your post points. Now, next up, we have another tip that will make your cologne last longer that has to do with proper application. You want to spray your cologne about six to eight inches away from your skin. While this works so well is that when you apply your cologne six to eight inches away, it allows you to disperse your cologne across a larger surface area of your skin. This helps you avoid a problem that happens when you spray the cologne too close to your skin. You get wet concentrated areas of fragrance. The reason why this is a problem, either your fragrance will quickly evaporate or because it's concentrated in one spot, it can become overwhelming. By covering more surface area of your skin, especially your post points, you allow the fragrance to diffuse naturally and more effectively the way it was designed to. So remember apply six to eight inches away from the skin. This also helps avoid over application as well. This is a great way to create a more balanced, effective and long lasting fragrance. Now throughout today's video so far, I've been giving you a lot of do's to make your cologne last longer. Now it's time to get into a couple of the top don'ts. Please don't rub the cologne into your wrist and don't spray it into the air and walk through it. You want to talk about wasting and making your cologne less effective. It doesn't get any worse than these two things. First up, rubbing your wrist. When you rub cologne into your skin, you're disrupting the top notes in the fragrance. Here's what I mean. For the uninformed, your cologne usually has three different phases. You have top notes, mid notes, and base notes, and they all serve purposes. When you rub the cologne into your skin, you're disrupting the top notes and this friction disrupts the sense natural progression. You're not getting the most out of your cologne. You're robbing your cologne of some of its complexity and its depth. You're just wasting it. And the problem with spraying the cologne into the air and walking through it, most of the cologne is getting wasted. It's going into the air, it's hitting the floor, it's getting on your clothes. It's definitely not being targeted to your post points. You're losing so much of your cologne before it even reaches you. Not only does this method waste your scent, it gives you a much weaker scent with the cologne that does hit your skin. For longer lasting results, what you want to do is spray your cologne six to eight inches away onto your post points and don't rub it. Don't do like we used to do back in my day, thinking it was cool to spray the cologne in the air and walk through it. Now next up is a way to make your cologne last longer just by having more information and more knowledge. What you want to do is learn about the different concentrations of cologne. This is great cologne 101. Your cologne comes in different concentrations of perfume oil that's mixed in and consequently a lot of times this will affect how long your cologne lasts. Now the main two concentrations you'll see men's fragrances come in are odor toalette and odor parfum. Typically your odor toalette will have lower concentrations of perfume oil meaning in general it won't last as long. Now on the other hand odor parfum are higher concentration of perfume oils thus usually lasting longer. So especially when you're shopping for different versions of the same scent typically you may have a choice between an odor toalette and an odor parfum. Most of the time if you select the odor parfum it will last longer. Now next up on a list of nine of the best ways to make your cologne last longer this one is about the maintenance of your cologne. I'm talking about proper storage. Now proper storage of your cologne is crucial for the longevity of it because not only does it affect the longevity of the application and how it interacts with your skin it also affects the shelf life of your fragrance. Here's what will degrade your cologne faster than you want to exposure to humidity, heat, light. All of these things when they interact with your fragrance degrades the composition of it causing it to lose its potency over time and altering the scent. You want to store your cologne in a cool dry place that's away from direct sunlight. What I often recommend is keep your cologne in its original box and or keep it in a dark cabinet. This will keep it away from the light, the heat, and the humidity. Another small thing to do after use your fragrance put the top back on completely. This helps prevent the cologne from having unnecessary air exposure which can degrade your scent. So remember to keep your fragrance away from light, heat, humidity, and air. Okay so there you have it. Nine of my best tips to make your cologne last all day long. Now do me a favor let me know in the comment section if you have some cologne hacks I might have left out.

        "transcript": " Today, we're getting into 10 weak men's traits that women find very unattractive. Now, not only will these traits affect your dating life, they can hold you back in life, period. That's why we're going to break down the behaviors and mindsets that can make you appear less confident, driven, or appealing. Because not only will this improve your dating relationships, it will make you a stronger, more respected man in all aspects of your life. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeffy Stilog. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics like style, grooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Michael Sanderson, salut. Now, first up on a list of 10 weak men's traits that women can't stand, this is an important one to take note of. They don't like it when you're indecisive. You see, women often find indecisiveness unattractive because it can signal a lack of confidence and leadership. Women generally appreciate a man who can take charge of his situation and make decisions. Whether talking about something as simple as where to go to eat, or more important life decisions. And when you are indecisive, it can create frustration, placing the burden of decision making squarely on the woman. And this is an easy way to make her feel unsure about your capabilities. So women, this can often reflect a possibility of deeper issues, like a fear of commitment or insecurity. A decisive man on the other hand appears confident, dependable, and having the capabilities to be a leader. And these are qualities that women often view as strong and very appealing in a potential partner. If you want to be more successful with women and in life, be more decisive. Now, next up is a characteristic often overlooked by us guys, but the women, they pay attention. They can't stand a guy who has emotional immaturity. Now, emotional immaturity is unattractive to women because it can signal an inability to handle life's challenges and emotions effectively. An emotionally immature guy, he struggles with communication and he will oftentimes avoid difficult conversations. And worse yet, he reacts impulsively to conflict, which can lead to unnecessary drama and instability in your relationships. This lack of emotional control can be very frustrating to women because it stands in the way of building a deep, strong and healthy relationship. Emotional maturity on the other hand involves understanding your feelings, being empathetic and resolving issues calmly. See women are typically drawn to men who are emotionally stable, capable of supporting each other through life's challenges. As these qualities promote trust, respect, and long-term success in your dating relationships. Emotional immaturity can often lead to this next weak men's trait. Having poor communication skills. Poor communication skills are a turn off to women because it can create misunderstandings, frustration, and emotional distancing in relationships. When you struggle to express your thoughts, feelings, and desires clearly, it can create confusion and more importantly create unresolved issues. See women approach it in emotional connection and open dialogue. And a lack of effective communication can easily make them feel unheard, underappreciated, and disconnected. Not a good thing. Also, poor communication skills often leads to small conflicts escalating and unresolved issues can build up over time. On the other hand, strong communication skills that demonstrate emotional maturity, active listening ability, empathy, and the willingness to work through challenges. All things that will draw women to you. A man who can communicate openly and honestly, he fosters trust, respect, and intimacy. All things that can create a strong bond with the ladies. Now, if you want a clear path to turning the ladies off, possess this next weak man's trait. Have a lack of ambition. Women definitely find guys with a lack of ambition unattractive because it can signal complacency and a lack of drive. Women generally appreciate a man who sets goals, strives for self-improvement, and most importantly has a clear direction in life. You see, women are turned on by purpose and passion. Qualities that contribute to long-term success and personal growth. Without ambition, you can easily fall into a place of stagnation and being content with mediocrity. Do you think being stagnant and mediocre is a turn on to the ladies? I didn't think so. A lot of times guys think they already have to be at the finish line to catch the ladies eyes. I'm here to tell you that's not true. What they want to see is that you have a clear sense of purpose, a path toward success, and you're on it. You see in relationships, a woman likes to share shared progress and growth. This creates a deep bond and a lack of ambition may suggest you're just not willing to put in the work to be a better man and a better potential partner. Ambition, on the other hand, inspires motivation and creates opportunities for a better future. Now, without a doubt, one of the worst traits you can possess as a man being a man who's needy. Neediness is very unattractive to women because it reflects emotional dependency and a lack of self-confidence. Women generally prefer men who are secure in themselves and can maintain their independence. When you're constantly seeking validation and overly clingy, this can make the woman feel suffocated and put unnecessary pressure on the relationship. This neediness can easily make you seem insecure and undermine trust and respect. Women appreciate men who have their own interests, friends, goals. As this shows emotional maturity on your part and creates balance, a man who's too reliant on his partner for assurance and attention, this is a sure way to come across his lacking confidence and can easily erode attraction and respect in the relationship. Neediness is often seen in the guy who possesses this next weak men's trait, being insecure. Now hear me clearly, I'm not saying you shouldn't have any insecurities, we all do. I'm talking about being overall insecure. This insecurity is unattractive to women because of course it reflects a lack of self-assurance and self-confidence. A man who's insecure, he may constantly seek validation, doubt or self-worth, fear rejection, which can easily create emotional instability and tension in the relationship. This often leads to jealousy, possessiveness, and overanalyzing small things. Easily undermine the trust in the relationship and can make the woman feel like a caretaker, not a partner. Insecurity can also hinder you from taking chances, taking initiative. Initiative and problem solving skills, these are things that women find very attractive. Confidence conveys strength, independence, determination, and emotional security. All things that will build up trust and stability in the relationship and will keep a woman very interested. Now next up is one from the list of greatest hits when it comes to weak men's traits. You don't want to be a guy who's passive. Women are definitely turned off by passivity because it indicates a lack of initiative, decisiveness, and leadership. Women generally prefer a guy who takes charge, makes decisions, and acts with a sense of purpose. The passive guy, he tends to avoid conflict, responsibility, and important decision making. And this easily can lead to frustration on the woman's part in the relationship. And when you're a guy who's passive, it can make you come across as indifferent or uninterested. And it places all the emotional burden on the relationship on the woman. She's not going to like that. This definitely creates an imbalance in the relationship that then can lead to disconnection and resentment. Women love a guy who's proactive, confident, decisive, and takes charge in all aspects of his life, including his dating relationships. And this easily can set the tone for an environment of security, respect, and excitement. Now, next up is the trait I highly recommend you guys try to stay away from having, whether we're talking about dating or just being a better man overall. Do not be the guy who overly apologizes. Now, over apologizing is problematic with women because it indicates a lack of self-assurance and self-confidence. The man who's constantly apologizing, especially for minor or non-existent issues, he comes across as insecure and seeking validation. This behavior can make you seem submissive or unsure of yourself. And women prefer a man who's confident and able to stand by his decisions even when they're unpopular. But you see, when you over-apologize, it diminishes the power of a genuine apology. And it makes them seem less meaningful when mistakes do actually occur. Now, don't get me wrong. Women appreciate a guy who takes accountability. They like a man who can stand by his actions without the constant need for approval. We're not quite done with the weak men's traits that come from overdoing something. You don't want to be the guy who over-complains. Now, over-complaining is unattractive to women because it can signal negativity, a lack of resilience, and an inability to face life's challenges constructively. Constant complaining can make you come across as a guy who's emotionally draining, pessimistic, and difficult to be around. All things are the opposite of women who are typically seeking a guy who creates a positive atmosphere. You see the guy who constantly complains instead of analyzing the problem, figuring out a solution, and taking action. His excessive complaining focuses on the negative, makes him take inaction and can lead to frustration and helplessness. Women's the last time you heard a woman say she wants to be with a guy who's helpless and frustrating. And the other problem about being a constant complainer, it makes you seem like you lack gratitude for the positive aspects of life. Women are typically drawn to men who display emotional strength. Optimism and the ability to face life challenges proactively. These are qualities that foster deep, healthy, and fulfilling relationships. Now, a couple of spots back, we talked about the problem over-apologizing. Now, we're going to the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to weak men's traits. You don't want to be the guy who has a lack of accountability. Now, lack of accountability is a turnoff to women because it can reflect immaturity and irresponsibility. When a man refuses to take responsibilities for his mistakes, his actions, or decisions, it can lead to frustration in relationship. Guy lacks accountability, often has an unwillingness to grow, learn, and improve from his mistakes. And this will turn off women who are seeking a mature man. Blaming others or refusing to take accountability for your actions and mistakes can easily make you seem unreliable and dishonest. No lady wants those traits. Women love a man who's accountable because it demonstrates integrity, responsibility, leadership, and emotional maturity. Not to mention the ability to handle life's challenges. And being a man who's accountable not only helps you in your dating, but makes you a better man overall. Okay, so there you have it. 10 weak men's traits that women hate. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comments section any characteristics often found in weak men that I might have left out of today's video. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about 10 things men should keep private. You can check it out right here."

You definitely can't go wrong with the bomber jacket. Now the bomber jacket is a great fall style choice because of its combination of comfort, versatility, and timeless appeal. Originally designed for pilots, the bomber jacket creates a sleek fitted clean silhouette that looks good on a wide range of body types. And its lightweight yet warm construction makes it perfect for the transitional fall weather, providing just the right amount of insulation without being too heavy.

Having a great lightweight feel, the Harrington jacket originated in the 1950s and has stood the test of time, making it a classic addition to your fall wardrobe.

Now for the uninformed the Shacket is just what it sounds like. A combination of a shirt and a jacket. It's a great style choice because it provides the comfort of the shirt with the warmth of a jacket making it a perfect choice when you find yourself indecisive during the fall. Is it too warm? Is it too chill? The shirt jacket often treads that middle ground perfectly because although it does have shirt elements it's usually made of a heavier fabric. Think flannel, wool, or even denim. The shirt jacket provides a great layer of insulation without overheating you. And they also happen to be a perfect layering piece. Layer them over a shirt or under a heavier jacket. And I also love that the shirt jacket typically has a relaxed slightly oversized fit making it a great choice for a wide range of body types. Because of its hybrid nature one of the most versatile jackets you can wear during the fall, the Shacket. Now next up on the list of the 10 fall jackets you might want to consider putting into your wardrobe this year is when I become more of a fan of the last couple of years.

Originally designed for athletic coaches this jacket features a snap button front, a drawstring hem, and a sleek minimalist design. Giving you one of the best clean modern looks you'll get out of any fall jacket.

Now first up on the list of the 10 best face washes for men is one I've been a fan of for several years and I always recommend it. You definitely want to check out Everyman Jack's Charcoal Face Wash. Now the main reason why I'm a big fan of the Everyman Jack Charcoal Face Wash is because it does a great job of deep, effective cleansing without stripping your skin of its natural moisture. And it does so without harsh chemicals. It's infused with activated charcoal which does a great job of removing dirt and oil and impurities from your skin, making it a great choice for my guys out there with oily skin or those who tend to get clogged pores. Now this is a plant-based formula containing ingredients like aloe vera and coconut derived surfactants. All that do a great job of getting that good clean skin but also soothing and moisturizing your skin as well. I love that its fragrance is refreshing yet subtle, making it a great choice for everyday use.

It's a firmly enriched with things such as apricot and avocado oil which all help to remove dirt, oil, impurities, but without over-drying or stripping your skin of its moisture. The pH-balanced formulation of Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cleanser helps you maintain your skin's natural barrier, meaning that after you use it, your skin feels soft, refreshed, and healthy. And another good thing about Kiehl's cleanser is fragrance-free, making it a less irritating choice for guys who have a bit of sensitive skin. Another thing I love about Kiehl's is how well it lathers, cleaning your skin well and getting it ready for the next steps in your skincare routine.

Now next up on the list of the best face washes for men is one that's a fan favorite and highly recommended by dermatologists. And I believe it's for good reason. Definitely want to check out Seta Phil's daily Facial Cleanser. Now the reason why I really love this one, it works on a wide range of skin types, from normal to oily to sensitive skin. If you need a gentle, effective cleanser that works for a wide range of people, this is the choice. It does an excellent job of getting ready to dirt and grime without irritating your skin. It has a low-lather formula that doesn't clog your pores, which makes it work very well for those that are prone to acne or sensitive skin. And this is another great cleanser that leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed, but not stripped of its natural moisture. It does an excellent job of helping maintain your skin's natural barrier. Also love this lightweight and fragrance-free formula that works very well on my guys like I said to have sensitive skin. Making it perfect for a wide range of skin types, but also for daily use, just like it says in the name. So if you're looking for a very effective dermatologist-recommended facial cleanser that gets the job done with low irritation, look no further than Set-A-Fills Daily Facial Cleanser. Now as I mentioned at the top of the video, we're going to be talking about facial washes that work on a wide range of skin types. My next recommendation is for my guys that struggle with acne or oily skin. You definitely want to check out Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash. This one does exactly what the name says. It's specifically formulated for those who struggle with acne. It's infused with 2% solid acidic acid that does a great job of penetrating deep into your pores, helping to clear out the oil and impurities that can lead to potential breakouts. And its formulation also contains Pro-Vitamin B, which does a great job of soothing and calming down the skin. Minimizing the irritation that you might see with other acne-clearing washes. And despite its strong acne-fighting ingredients, it doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped or dry. And another thing about about this Peter Thomas Roth, it has a subtle orange scent that helps leave your skin feeling fresh. Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash is a great recommendation for those that are looking for a facial cleanser that fights acne but doesn't irritate your skin and leaves it feeling smooth. Now next up on the list of the 10 best face washers for men is one that does an excellent job pulling double duty. Not only cleaning, but exfoliating. You definitely want to check out Harry's exfoliating face wash. Now not only does Harry's exfoliating face wash clean your skin very well, it also exfoliates. The main thing is to strip away the dead skin cell layers that can accumulate on the top layer and help reveal the smoother younger skin cells beneath. And it doesn't with a formula that is infused with natural ingredients such as Volcano Rock and Papaya Extract. And the formula also contains soothing ingredients such as Eucalyptus and Aloe, which leaves the skin feeling hydrated and smooth without any irritation. And another really thing I really like about Harry's exfoliating face wash is his creamy lavish. It's invigorating and makes using it very pleasurable. Especially before shaving as it helps reduce ingrown hairs and clog pores. Harry's exfoliating wash does an excellent job of being tough on dirt and grime but gentle on your skin. Now next up is one of my top choices for my guys out there with sensitive skin who needs something gentle. My best recommendation for you, Neutrogena's mild gentle facial cleanser. This mild gentle facial cleanser from Neutrogena that's also fragrance free does an excellent job of getting sensitive skin clean with a non-irritating formula full of natural ingredients. Which helps maintain your skin's natural moisture barrier and leaves it feeling refreshed and not dry. And it's free from harsh ingredients you might see in other facial washes such as parabens, sulfates, and fragrances. So it makes it ideal for daily use for all skin types but especially sensitive skin. Another thing I really like about Neutrogena's mild facial cleanser, lavish is likely yet effectively removing dirt and grime very well. And its glycerin-infused formulation helps soothe and soften your skin. So if you're looking for a very effective face wash that's very gentle and sensitive skin I highly recommend Neutrogena's mild gentle facial cleanser. Now next up on the list is an effective face wash for my guys out there who have very dry or dehydrated skin. Who need maximum hydration. This is all in the name.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into fall style with a focus on what not to wear. Now as we age, it's important that we adapt our style to be modern, sharp and confident. However, unfortunately there are certain style items that is older guys we can wear can make us seem outdated and out of touch. That's what we're going to try to avoid on today's video. On today's video, we will cover nine fall style mistakes you want to stay away from so that you can look polished, refined and sophisticated, not to mention timeless. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style. Oh, gee. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, if any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell and join us into my returning friends like Christopher wall. Salut. Now, first up on a list of nine fall items older guys should never wear is one that reinforces a recurring theme throughout today's video, not wearing things that make you look less refined and less sophisticated. That's why you want to stay away from oversized sweaters. Now, oversized sweaters are fall style mistake for us. OGs because they often add unnecessary bulk, which can easily make your body appear larger and less refined. You see these oversized sweaters will give you a loose, sloppy fit, creating an unpolished look that detracts from your overall appearance. For older men, fit is crucial to maintain a sharp modern look. An oversized clothing can have the opposite effect, giving you a frumpy out of touch look, a well fitted or tailored sweater on the other hand enhances and compliments the body's natural shape, which will offer you a more streamlined and flattering appearance. That only helps you maintain a more youthful and polished look that will protect confidence and attention to detail. Something you want to do as you become an OG. Now, next up is a fall style mistake you want to avoid no matter what the age, but I believe is even more important for the older guy. You don't want to go out with an empty wrist. I believe a stylist man should wear a watch every day, not wearing a watch is a fall style mistake because a watch adds a level of sophistication and completeness to your fall outfits. Watches are not only functional, but they serve as a subtle accessory that gives you a level of completeness and communicates in attention to detail, especially in the fall when layering and accessories play even a bigger part in your style. A well chosen watch can elevate even a simple outfit, adding a bit of elegance and personality to all your fall looks. For older men, a classic timeless piece signals a level of maturity and taste and helps you avoid the look of a forgotten or incomplete outfit. Skipping a watch can make your outfit look less intentional, less well thought out and overlooks the opportunity to showcase your style through timeless accessories. Now next up is a style mistake that falls in the category of the finer details. You want to make sure you don't make the mistake of wearing the wrong scent. Now, wearing the wrong scent can be a fall style mistake for older guys because how important a role scent plays and how you present yourself in the cooler months, heavier, more complex fragrance are often more appropriate as they compliment the richer fabrics and layering typical through this season. Wearing a light summery fragrance or too heavy of a scent, one that's outdated can clash with the season's mood and make you seem out of touch. Now what you want to out for during the fall are colognes that balance warmth and sophistication. Think amber, spices, leather. Now choosing the right fragrance that can elevate your style, but choosing the wrong one can detract from your overall look. That's why wearing the right fragrance is such an important decision. Now if you need some little advice on what fragrance is to wear this fall, check out a recent video I did about the 10 best fall colognes for this year. I'll leave a link to that video in the description. So you will be well on your way to choosing the right cologne this fall. Now next up is a fall style mistake you want to avoid, even if you are dad age or an actual dad, you might want to avoid dad jeans. Now dad jeans can be a fall style mistake for older guys because they often have an outdated, unflattering fit that can make you look older than you are and out of touch with modern style. You see dad jeans often characterized by loose fit, high waist and lighter wash tend to lack the structured look that would give you a more polished and youthful appearance. Not to mention dad jeans tend to add unnecessary bulk, fail to define your body and can lead to you having a more sloppy appearance. In contrast, choosing jeans with a slim or straight fit, most often in darker washes, create a more clean, refined look. By avoiding dad jeans, you can create an outfit that has more polished sophistication and can help you maintain a sharp, stylish and more fall appropriate wardrobe. Now next up is a fall style mistake that I know is a bit of a challenge, especially if you like myself, an old school sneaker head. You've got to avoid overly trendy sneakers. Now, often for trendy sneakers can be a problem for us OGs because this type of footwear tends to skew youthful and can take away from a more refined, polished appearance. You see these trend driven sneakers often with bold designs, exaggerated shapes, loud colors can appear out of place for us older guys and detract from a sophisticated look. Not to mention these trendy sneakers become dated very quickly and by you choosing them, it can make it seem like you're trying too hard to be young. Like you're trying too hard to keep up with a youthful audience you're no longer a part of. Instead, I recommend you opt for classic minimalist designs. Once they have a touch of sophistication and blend well with your fall outfit, choosing understated versatile classic footwear blends more with a refined sophisticated look. Now next up is a fall style mistake that's very particular to older guys overutilization of pleated trousers. Now I get it pleated pants, they are a classic. However, there can be a style mistake for older guys because pleated pants often add unnecessary bulk. That's the around the hips and waist. And as most of us get older and put on a couple of pounds, that's not very flattering. Now I get it pleated trousers have often been a wardrobe staple, but modern style often favors flat front pants. Once they create a more polished, refined and streamlined look for older guys, especially clinging to pleated trousers can create an outdated, out of touch look. Not to mention, in my opinion, flat front trousers fit better with a lot of your other falls choices, your sweaters, your jackets. Now I'm not saying OG shouldn't wear pleated trousers at all. I just mean you shouldn't overwear them. Now next up is a mistake that occurs when you improperly incorporate a fall essential technique. You want to make sure you're not layering incorrectly. Now layering incorrectly is a fall style mistake for older guys because of how it can make an outfit big bulky, unflattering and disorganized. Poor layering choices such as mismatch textures, colors or too many thick pieces can add unnecessary volume. We don't need that because of how it can obscure your body's natural shape, making you come off a bit sloppy. Not to mention when you layer incorrectly, it can come off as less attention to detail and less intentional. Now if you want some advice on how to layer correctly, pay attention to a few of these things. First of all, when it comes to layering, you want to wear the thinner items closer to the body and maybe get thicker as you go out. You also want to make sure you're wearing the longest layer on the outside. I often also recommend you wear darker clothes on the outside and very importantly, when it comes to layering, each piece should work well on its own, whether you add layers or remove them. Now next up is a fall style mistake. I see an every age category, but I notice it more in us older guys wearing dark drab colors all the time. Now wearing dark drab colors day after day is a fall style mistake because it can make you appear like listen uninspired. Worrying dark colors all the time, even those associated with fall like gray, black and brown exclusively can actually make you appear blended into the background and seem even older. Now I'm not telling you, you shouldn't wear your black, your gray, your browns, your navies. Those are cool, very fall appropriate, but you want to make sure you're mixing it up, adding some richer colors during the fall. Think burgundy, mustard, olive. These colors can add depth and complexity to your outfit, giving you more dynamic appearance. What you need to keep in mind as older guys can benefit from a pop of color, even in the fall. Make sure you're adding a pop of color here and there. It will give you a look, some confidence and vitality. Now next up on a list of nine fall style items older guys should never wear is one that reinforces our recurring theme, not adding unnecessary volume. OGs want to avoid bulky jackets. Now wearing bulky jackets in the fall is a starving state because they can easily overwhelm your frame, creating an unflattering silhouette. These oversized jackets add what we want to stay away from that unnecessary volume, making your body appear larger and less polished. This can easily distract from a sophisticated refined appearance. What you want to opt for instead tailored, well fitted jackets. You want to think about pieces like a tailored overcoat, a great bomber jacket or a slim puffer jacket. One is to help you maintain a polished profile and enhance your overall look. They give you the needed warmth without the unnecessary bulk, while also still ensuring that you have comfort and practicality. Okay, so there you have it. In my humble opinion, nine fall style items older guys should never wear. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comments section, any fall style items you believe OG should avoid that I might have forgotten. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about 10 groovy mistakes that can make older guys look old.

        "transcript": " It's time to have some straight talk about 11 hard decisions every man must make in his lifetime. Now, life is full of choices, but there are some that stand out as pivotal, shaping the course of our future and defining who we are. That's why in today's video, we're gonna delve into the importance of these moments and how you can navigate them with confidence and clarity. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style OG. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Jeff McClure, S-U-L-U. First up on the list of 11 hard decisions every man must make in his lifetime, you must prioritize your purpose above else. That's because doing so allows you to have a sense of motivation, direction, and fulfillment in your life. Having a sense of purpose allows you to stay focused on what truly matters, and it helps you make decisions that align with both your values and your priority. When you understand your purpose, you're gonna be more resilient in the face of challenges, and you'll see them not as obstacles, but steps towards your objectives. Prioritizing your purpose also gives you a sense of meaning and satisfaction, which is essential for your mental and emotional well-being. It allows you to live authentically and fosters a sense of accomplishment and pride in your contributions, not only to your own life, but to the life of those around you. Now don't get me wrong, your hobbies, your interests, dating, all those things matter, but as men we must prioritize our purpose first. You'll wind up seeing that all those other things fall in line and tend to go much better when your purpose comes first. Now next up is what I know is a very difficult decision we're all gonna have to make from time to time. You have to decide to leave some people behind. Now understanding is a difficult decision because it can lead to feelings of guilt, uncertainty, and emotional pain. With relationships, whether it's with some of our familial friends or romantic, they can be a huge part of your identity and your support system. However, over time you're gonna grow and change, and the people that you have around you may no longer align in your values, your goals, or your lifestyle choices. One of the phrases I'll often use when it comes to these situations, everybody can't go. And I know choosing to move on from some of these relationships can seem like you're betraying your shared history and your shared memories. However, staying in toxic or no longer fulfilling relationships can hinder your personal growth and also hinder your long term happiness. Making the difficult choice to leave some people behind is part of you prioritizing your well-being, your purpose, and creating a healthy space for more supportive and more aligned relationships to come into your life. Remember, everybody can't go. Now next up is the difficult decision on the opposite end of the spectrum. When you decide to commit to a relationship, this can be difficult because it requires in your part sacrifice, vulnerability, and a significant investment of time and emotion. And this choice often means setting aside some of your personal freedom and adapting to someone else's needs and desires, which can be challenging if you value independence. On top of that, we have to take into account and involve some potential risks, risk of heartbreak, and the responsibility of nurturing a long term partnership, both of which can be very daunting. And I get it. There's also a fear of making the wrong choice, having doubts about compatibility and your future. But I want you to try to look at it this way. A lot of people say choosing to make is the most important decision you will make in your lifetime. And it has the potential for high reward. Anything in your life that has high reward is going to involve some risk. You're going to have to put a lot of effort into it. You have to do that with work, with school, so why would relationships be any different? And you have to keep in mind the upside is very great. This can make it a pivotal decision that shapes your life's path and your happiness. Now, choosing whether to commit to a relationship or not is an example of our next hard decision all guys must make. Whether or not to take a risk. I get it. Taking a risk can be very difficult because it involves stepping into the unknown, which can be unpredictable and scary. Taking risks affects various aspects of your life, your career, your finances, and whether you achieve personal goals. And most of the time, the fear of failure, loss, or rejection can hold you back, making it very difficult for you to step out of your comfort zone. Also societal expectations and desire for stability can create pressure to play it safe. However, taking risks is essential for growth, innovation, and personal development. And it opens the door to new opportunities, learning experiences, and achievements, which otherwise wouldn't be attainable. Throughout life, we all have to evolve and grow. But you have to realize you rarely will see growth in your comfort zone. You gotta take risks. Taking risks, that's something you'll definitely be doing when you make this next hard decision. Whether or not to change career paths. Now changing career paths can be a difficult decision because it involves leaving behind the comfort of the familiar for the uncertainty of the unknown. And for a lot of us men, our career not only represents our income, but a significant portion of our identity and our self-worth. Not to mention transitioning to a new field can mean starting over, learning new skills, and yet sometimes a temporary pay cut. Changing career paths can have a significant impact on our personal relationships and life stability. The fear of failure and the concerns of other people's expectations can lead to the emotional burden of making such a difficult choice. However, despite these challenges, changing your career path can lead to greater job satisfaction, personal growth, and being more in alignment with your current values, goals, and principles. And also when you change career paths, it may allow you to do something that lines up with your current passion, which can ultimately contribute to a more fulfilling life. Now next up is a no-brainer decision that doesn't make it any less difficult. Prioritizing, maintaining your health. Now this one can be a hard decision because of what it requires. Commitment, discipline, and yet sometimes lifestyle changes. Prioritizing your health means making conscious decisions. To exercise, eat right, get quality nights of sleep, which can be challenging among the demands of work, family, and social obligations. Not to mention the temptation to indulge in unhealthy habits, such as neglecting exercise, eating unhealthy snacks, is ever-present, especially in stressful situations. Also maintaining regular health checkups, getting regular exercise, planning your meals. This requires a lot of time and energy. And I get it, the immediate gratification of unhealthy choices, this can be very tempting and can easily sometimes outweigh the appeal of long-term health decisions. But we all know this. Making this hard decision is paramount to help all of us men live a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life. Now next up is a hard decision more and more of us are facing nowadays. The decision to move to a new city, state, or perhaps new country. Now this is a hard decision because of what it requires of you. It requires you to leave behind the familiarity of home, established relationships, and your sense of comfort. This choice often requires you to step out of your comfort zone and adapt to new environments, social dynamics, cultures, which can be both exciting and intimidating. I get it. However, this decision can have a profound positive impact on your life by offering new opportunities, experiences, and perspectives, very enriching. And relocating can lead to career advancements, access to better education, or a more desirable lifestyle. Sometimes to have a great impact on your life, you got to step out of your comfort zone. And you might just have to leave your hometown. Want to make a hard decision with high reward? Decide to move to a new city or state. Now next up is a very hard decision to make, especially if you made the first decision I talked about in the beginning of the video. Prioritizing your purpose above all else. It makes it very difficult to balance your work and personal life. Now, this no doubt is a hard decision because it requires you to maintain a balance between competing obligations and responsibility. On one hand, your work requires dedication, productivity, focus, and it often can lead to long hours to achieve your career goals and financial stability. But on the other hand, your personal life requires a huge investment in time and energy as well. Family, romantic relationships, and very importantly, your interests and hobbies, which are key to maintaining your mental and emotional well-being. And striking the right balance can be extremely difficult, especially if you work in a high pressure environment. Or when you're pursuing ambition career goals. But in the long run, you have to strike this balance. Choosing to prioritize personal or professional life above the other can easily lead to burnout or feelings of guilt or stress. None of us need that. Although it's difficult, we all must find a way to balance work and personal. Now, next up is an under the radar decision that's very important and very difficult. From time to time, we all must confront our personal values. Now, this is a hard decision because it requires some true introspection and some honesty about what truly matters to you. And confronting your personal values can be challenging because you may come face to face with some long held beliefs or some social expectations that may no longer lie, which are currently evolving sense of yourself. And this process can lead to some uncomfortable realizations and difficult choices as it may require you to stand up to yourself in the face of criticism because your changing principles and values may go against the grain. But the benefits of confronting your personal values far outweigh these challenges because it can be profoundly positive, leading to personal growth, a strong sense of self and authenticity. By aligning your beliefs and your actions with your current core values, this will help lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life. Now, next up is one of the most difficult but necessary decisions we all have to make. The hard decision of facing your failures. Now, facing your failures can be very difficult because it can challenge your self-esteem, your resilience, and your confidence. When you face your failures, it can give you a sense of inadequacy, disappointment, and you have the fear of judgment of others. So it can lead to the tendency to avoid risk or deny mistakes. Here's where that's counterproductive. Successful men, they face their failures. They know that's the part of their life's journey on the path to success. Instead of avoiding or running away from their failures, they face them head on. They look at them as learning experiences. They evaluate mistakes, see where they went wrong, and vow to not make that same mistake the next time. But you can't learn from your failures if you don't face them in the first place. You have to face your failures, acknowledge your mistakes, and use them as opportunities to grow. You see facing your failures improves your problem-solving skills, your decision-making, and your failures help pay the way for future success. Speaking of paying the path to future success, that brings us to our next hard decision. You have to plan your future. Now, a lot of guys find this a hard decision because it involves uncertainty, weighing various priorities, and it requires long-term thinking, which can be very draining sometimes. Deciding on your career goals, financial choices, personal relationships, this requires a lot of consideration and foresight. And here's where the difficulty comes in. Balancing immediate concerns with long-term things. Sometimes that may require you to sacrifice immediate gratification for the promise of tomorrow. Thoughtful planning helps you navigate challenges, both seen and unseen. When you think about what you're going to do, how you will do it, it can have huge benefits, such as providing direction, focus, and a sense of purpose. And when you go over your short, mid, and long-term goals, it gives you a sense of security, some stability. When you're someone who can make the hard decision of long-term planning, it ensures more long-term fulfillment, a happier life, and will definitely increase your chances of a successful future. Okay, so there you have it. 11 of the hardest decisions every man must make, and why I believe they're so pivotal. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comments section any important decisions you believe I might have left out. And if you enjoyed this video and found it informative, I highly recommend you check out a recent video I did about the 10 things men should always keep private. You can check it out right here."

        "transcript": " It's time to get into our annual list of the 10 best fall colognes for 2024. Now for this year, I've curated a list of fragrances that capture the essence of fall, blending warm, woody and spicy notes that are ideal for the cooler months. So whether you're looking for a cologne that makes a bold statement or something subtle that compliments your style, you're in the right place. And of course there's a link in the description to all the colognes we talked about on today's video. If you want to grab one or two for yourself. Now, if you're new here, welcome, Jeff, your style. Oh, gee. On this channel, we discussed various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap that notification bell and join us. And to my returning friends like Adrian Moran, salute. Now, first up on the list of the 10 best colognes for fall 2024, I have one of the newest additions to my collection from a line I absolutely love. It's woody, it's spicy, it's earthy, it's pottery. You definitely want to check out Mason Margiela's replica, autumn vibes. Just like with all the other colognes in Mason Margiela's collection, the replica line, this one captures the essence of what they're trying to go for. Autumn leaves, warmth, spicy, it's crisp and it's woody. Absolutely love it. And it arrives at this great scent with a combination of top notes of cardamom and pink pepper. You've got some mid notes of nutmeg, apple and carrot seeds. And in the base, you have cedar and moss, all combined to give you this warm, woody, nostalgic, comforting vibe. Another thing I really love about autumn vibes from Mason Margiela is that it's a well balanced scent. It's not too heavy, not too woody. It's crisp, it's modern, it's timeless, perfect for the fall. When a great addition to your fall cologne rotation, don't hesitate to pick up Mason Margiela's replica, autumn vibes. Now next up on the list, we have a modern and sophisticated interpretation of an all time classic, a great 2018 flanker, one that's mineral, woody, aromatic and spicy. You definitely want to check out Ter de Mez's Oh Intense Vettiver. Now of course this Oh Intense Vettiver is a flanker of the all time classic Ter de Mez and especially wearable fragrance that definitely works well during the fall. But I believe this Oh Intense Vettiver is a great mature interpretation of that classic. It's sophisticated, it's modern, it's smooth and it arises at this great scent with a combination of top notes, bergamot, grapefruit and lemon. In the midge you have pepper and geranium and in the base you have Vettiver, patchouli and amberwood, giving you that classic Ter de Mez feel, but with the emphasis on that masculine trait of Vettiver. I believe it's a woody and more pronounced version of Ter de Mez, but a little less citrusy. I think this is a great selection for the confident and sophisticated man who's looking for a fall cologne that exudes a refined masculinity. You definitely can't go wrong with Ter de Mez's Oh Intense Vettiver. Now next up on the list we have an excellent 2020 release that's a superb fall fragrance that won't break the bank. It's woody, leathery, aromatic and warm. You definitely want to check out Cremo's Palo Santos. Now when it comes to the Cremo cologne line, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck in all of their choices. And that's definitely the case with Palo Santos. It's smooth, it's inviting, it's mysterious and very affordable. It's a mix of notes like cardamom, papyrus, tonka bean, cedar and Palo Santos, all combined to give you this bold, warm, creamy, smooth fragrance. Now Palo Santos is leathery, it's citrusy, it's crisp. And like I said, it punches way above its price range, giving you a great sophisticated, refined take on the fall fragrance. I really love its masculine barbershop opening that warms up as you wear throughout the day. Excellent fall choice. That's woody, leathery, aromatic and spicy. You definitely can't go wrong with Cremo's Palo Santos from their reserve collection. Now next up on the list, we have a phenomenal 2023 release. That's definitely not on the affordable side like the Cremo pick. This is more of a clone if you want to treat yourself. It's the tobacco, cinnamon, vanilla, fruity scent that feels luxurious and expensive. I'm talking about biocillian smoking hot. Now smoking hot has this great apple pie feel. It's boozy, it's warm, it's smooth, it's sophisticated. And it arises in this great scent with a combination of top notes of apple, cinnamon and some smoke notes. In the mid you have tobacco, vanilla and moss. And you finish out in the base notes with some licorice, cinnamon and clary sage, all combined to give you the sophisticated, refined, warm, intoxicating, cologne that balances spicy, sweet and smooth. It's a great woody scent that exudes confidence and the Lord. I believe smoking hot is distinctive and daring and leaves a lasting impression. So if you're looking for a great tobacco, cinnamon, smooth, boozy scent, look no further than biocillians smoking hot. Now next up we have an excellent 2015 release. That's warm, woody, spicy, floral and powdery. And it's from a line that's popular with both the fellas and the ladies. You definitely can't go wrong with Joe Malone's Mamosa and Cardamom. Now Joe Malone's Mamosa and Cardamom is an Oriental spicy scent. It's woody, it's smooth, warm, fresh and clean. And it arises in this great scent with the top note of Cardamom, a mid note of Mamosa and a base note of Tonka bean. All combined, you give you this great wearable, versatile, gentle, warm and calming scent. I love that this Mamosa and Cardamom has an air of sweetness, but that warmth of the Tonka bean understated, memorable, inviting and subtle. Now, yes, although the Joe Malone line is seen as unisex, I believe this one definitely leans masculine. So if you're looking for an understated, subtle, smooth and spicy scent, look no further than Joe Malone's Mamosa and Cardamom. Now next up on the list of the best fall clothes for 2024 is one that I recently became acquainted with and I love to share it with you. It's boozy, it's sweet, it's leathery, it's woody, it's amber. You definitely want to check out Bianco Cherry Leather, older parfum. Now, what I love about this Bianco Cherry Leather, it's a bit unconventional, but still inviting and welcoming to a wide range of wearers. Oriental is spicy and is sweet and leathery, as the name suggests. And it arises this fantastic scent with a combination of top notes of black pepper, fennel and saffron. In the mids, you have cherry and bitter almond. And in the base notes, you finish up with oak wood, moss and woody and smoky notes, all combined to give you a scent that marries the richness of leather with the sweetness of cherry. To me, Bianco Cherry Leather is vibrant, is energetic, a bit playful, and it has that hint of smokiness that's balanced well with the fruitiness. So if you're looking for a versatile, rich, smooth cologne that works just as well in casual and formal settings, you definitely want to check out Bianco Cherry Leather, older parfum.

In the mid you have cardamom, ginger, iris and juniper. And in the base notes, you finish up with some Tahitian vetiver, tea, seedier, leather and oak moss, all combined to give you this distinct, classic, familiar, subtle, sexy and smooth cologne. But I love about Cartier Declaration. It's lasting, it's memorable. It makes a great impression, but in a subtle and refined way.

So if you're looking for a great woody, musk amber scent, look no further than Brioni's E-Cla. Now next up on the list, we have what I believe is an overlooked cologne in a very popular line. It's one that I have in my collection, but I forget to reach for it as well. It's sensual, it's rich, it's warm, it's spicy, it's floral. You definitely want to check out Tom Ford's Black Orchid.

But it definitely stands out if you're looking for a cologne that's heavy on the cedar. Definitely can't go wrong picking Burberry's Hero.

        "transcript": " It's time to get into 10 of the worst dating mistakes older guys tend to make and how you can avoid them so you can have a more successful dating life. Now whether you're back on the dating scene freshly or have been dating for a while, it's crucial to recognize habits that might be turning potential partners away. If you want to improve your dating game and make great impressions, stick around as we break down these 10 worst dating mistakes and offer practical tips on how to steer away from them. Now if you're new here, welcome Jeffy's Style O.G. On this channel we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, rooming, and dating. If any of those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends like Tim Clark, salute. Now first up on the list of the 10 worst dating mistakes older guys tend to make is one out of a course is near and dear to my heart. Not reevaluating your style and your rooming. This is a crucial dating mistake because your appearance is one of the most important things when it comes to making a great first impression. And I get it, us O.G.s is very easy to get stuck in a style that worked for us 10, 20, or 30 years ago. But sticking to these outdated style and rooming preferences can make you seem dated and out of touch. You don't want that. And another thing, it also can indicate a lack of self-awareness and effort. Trust me when you're going on these dates, women are putting a lot of effort into how they appear and they expect you to do the same. As times change, so does style and rooming preferences and social norms. You got to keep up to stay relevant. That old haircut or facial hairstyle that worked for you back in 1995 might not work today, my brother. Now next up is a very common dating mistake for us O.G.s. Sticking the outdated dating strategy. Now this is a mistake for older guys because it can make you appear out of touch to potential partners. Dating has evolved significantly due to technology, social media, and changed social norms. Relying on outdated techniques such as overly formal courtship rituals or expecting the same old rules to apply in a new day, that's a huge mistake. Today's dating culture values authenticity and mutual respect. And women are going to appreciate a modern, adaptable approach. By sticking to outdated dating strategies, you might come across as rigid, inflexible, or resistant to change, all which can be a turn off to that woman. Embracing new dating strategies prioritizes relevance, a willingness to grow, and an adaptability. Now next up is one that's on the opposite end of the spectrum from outdated dating strategies. It's a huge mistake to try to act younger than you are. This is a dating mistake for older guys because it can make you come across as inauthentic and insecure. Trying to mimic the behavior, fashion trends, and language of a younger generation means you're probably not comfortable with yourself and your age. And it will just make you seem like you're trying too hard to fit in. When a woman is dating an older guy, she expects you to be older. And trying to act younger than you are creates a disconnect. She won't know who she's dating behind that younger acting facade. Authenticity is key to building a genuine connection. Lean on your experience, your wisdom, the knowledge that you've acquired. When you try to do the opposite, this will signify to the woman a lack of self-confidence. Embracing you to maturity can be more attractive to a woman, especially if it's authentic. And this will help you establish the solid foundation of a meaningful relationship. Now next up, without a doubt, is one of the most common dating mistakes my OGs make. Being overly critical or judgmental. Now this is a dating mistake because it can create a negative and unwelcoming atmosphere, making it very hard to build a genuine connection. Constantly criticizing modern trends, the younger generation, what you see in society, especially new ideas can make you seem out of touch, clothes-minded, and too self-absorbed. This is an attitude not only stifles open communication, it can make the woman you're dealing with reluctant to reveal her true self in fear of being judged. You see, women are often attracted to positivity, openness, and the ability to appreciate different perspectives. By being overly critical and judgmental, it makes it very difficult for a new woman to connect with you. Because being overly critical makes you come across as being more focused on what you dislike than finding common ground and shared interests. Now next up is a dating mistake older guys have been making for quite a while. Bringing up your financial status. Bringing up your financial status, especially early in the relationship, can make it seem like you're either trying to buy affection or you define yourself by your wealth. Discussing money too soon can shift the focus away from building a genuine connection and put it squarely on materialistic concern. And believe it or not, it might make the woman you're dating feel uncomfortable or pressure or even unsure about the true intentions of the relationship. Not to mention leading with your wallet brings in the wrong type of woman, a woman who's interested more in money than she is a genuine relationship. Successful dating relationships are based on shared values, principles, and compatibility, not just financial stability. Now if you want a direct route to turning off that new woman you just started dating, make this next mistake. Comparing past relationships. Now this is a big problem because it undermines the uniqueness of a new relationship. Not to mention it can create unnecessary pressure. When you're constantly referencing past relationships or experiences, it makes the new woman feel like she's being evaluated against someone from the past, which can be discouraging and hurtful. This comparison can prevent the development of a genuine connection. As it shifts the focus away from the present relationship and onto past experiences, dating failures, and successes. Also, you know what it might signal to the new woman? That you have unresolved issues that prevent you from moving forward. That's not a turn on. To build a meaningful relationship is very important to appreciate the present. To focus on the person in front of you without the shadow of the past. And that's closely related to the next dating mistake my OGs tend to make. Talking too much about the past. This is a dating mistake because it shifts the focus off building a connection in the present and the future. Constantly recounting past achievements, experiences, relationships. This can seem more like a monologue about history rather than an engaging conversation about mutual interest and current events. This can come across as self-centered or prevent a woman from investing time and energy in a relationship she feels like you can't move forward in if you're constantly talking about the five touchdowns you scored against Polk High. I'm talking to you Al Bundy. Effective dating of balls being present in the present and the future. Sharing new experiences and focused on building a new relationship rather than being stuck in the past. Now, next up is a common faux pas and older guys, whether we're talking about dating or other aspects of life. Being too set in your ways. Now, this is a dating mistake for us OGs because it makes you come across as inflexible, intolerable, and resistant to new experiences. I get it. You've been the way you are for a long time, but this can make you come across as rigid. If you're too stuck in your old routines, old opinions, and habits, it can prevent the growth of a relationship. Because let's face it, if all your old ways work, you wouldn't be single. And this can limit your ability to adapt to a new partner's preferences and needs. And this lack of adaptability can make you less likely to compromise a very important trait in any relationship. And it can make you come across as being unwilling to share new experiences and new ideas, which is a very exciting part of a new relationship. And this can make it hard to connect with a new partner who values growth and change. Now, next up is a dating mistake my older guys make that might be a little lonely as they enter the dating scene. That's being too eager to impress. Now, this is a huge dating mistake because it can come across as insecure or desperate. When you try too hard to showcase your wealth, unique traits, or your accomplishments, it can create a superficial connection rather than one that's built on genuine compatibility. And this eagerness also can make the new woman feel uncomfortable or pressured. Because it makes you come across as being more interested in validation than mutual interest. You see, authenticity is key in dating. Presenting yourself naturally and confidently is very attractive to most women, rather than trying to impress her with exaggerated claims or gestures. Being genuine fosters deeper connections and shows that you're comfortable with who you are, which is very essential in building a meaningful new relationship. Now, next up is a dating mistake I want you to try to avoid at all costs. Do not ignore red flags. Now, this is a crucial dating mistake because it can lead to unhealthy and potentially damaging relationships. Here's the thing, when you're first back on the dating scene, it's easy to ignore these red flags to only see the good. This will only hurt you in the long run. And I know a lot of guys may do this because they're seeking companionship. They don't want to be alone. But ignoring these red flags can result in enduring problems. Trust me. Red flags such as inconsistent behavior, rude behavior, or unresolved emotional issues can lead to deep-saded relationship problems as you go along. Trust me, ignoring these red flags will only lead to conflict in the near future. Now, next up is a mistake you definitely want to avoid if you're looking to build something meaningful with a new woman. You want to make sure you're emotionally available. Being emotionally unavailable is a dating mistake older guys make because it can hinder you from building a deep intimate connection with this new woman. Here's the thing, as we get older, a lot of us are going to come into relationships with baggage. I get it. We all have bruises and scars that we develop over time. But don't let it make you emotionally unavailable. Yes, to have a deep relationship, even us guys have to have some vulnerability. When you're emotionally unavailable, you know how that can come across as you being distant or unavailable or uninterested. And this makes it difficult for a woman to feel valued or secured. If you have a difficulty allowing yourself to be mostly available, it's going to be difficult for her to develop true feelings for you as well. And this lack of emotional engagement can lead to misunderstandings, frustration, ultimately a breakdown in the relationship. Now, here's the thing. If you're emotionally unavailable and you're only interested in having fun, let the woman know. But if you're looking to build any deep, meaningful connection, you have to let your guard down. OK, so there you have it. 11 of the worst dating mistakes older guys tend to make. Now, do me a favor. Let me know in the comments section if you think I left off some common mistakes old geez made out on the dating scene.

        "transcript": " Today, we're bringing down the top 10 traits and habits that set success mental part from the rest. Now, whether you're striving for success in your career, personal life, or overall growth, understanding these key factors can help you come closer to achieving your goals. Now, whether we're talking about staying resilient, time management, these habits are priorities on the road to success. So if you're ready to elevate your life and unlock your full potential, stay tuned. Now, if you're new here, welcome Jeff, your style of G. On this channel, we discuss various men's lifestyle topics such as style, grooming, and dating. If any of all those topics interest you, I invite you to subscribe, tap the notification bell, and join us. And to my returning friends, like Edward Washington, salut. Now, the first trait we're going to discuss on our list of the top 10 things that make men successful is first for a reason. You will often find successful men have this trait, a strong work ethic. A strong work ethic is crucial on the road to success because it drives consistent effort, perseverance, and dedication, all which are essential in helping you achieve your goals. Men with a strong work ethic have no problem investing the time and the energy needed for them to excel, even when faced with challenges or setbacks. You see the successful man realizes most of the time success isn't found overnight. It's a long term project and they're willing to put in the hard work required for them to reach their objectives. And this relentless drive is often what sets them apart in a competitive environment. By maintaining a strong work ethic, successful men also build a reputation of competence and reliability, earning respect, and creating opportunities for advancement in both personal and professional roles. Now, next up is a habit that's very common amongst successful men. They have a practice of goal setting. Now, goal setting is a key driver of success because it provides direction, focus, and motivation. Men who set clear achievable goals, often see consistent progress, avoid distractions, and get more done because they have a clear defined path. Goals act as a roadmap, breaking down long term goals into small achievable steps, which makes the journey to success less overwhelming and more achievable. Also, goal setting helps you manage your progress, stay accountable, and make the necessary adjustments along the way. This proactive approach not only fosters discipline and determination, but it also helps instill a sense of purpose, very key for any man. By consistently setting and achieving goals, you'll be on the path to personal and professional success. Now, next up is a trait that's very essential for you to develop if you want to be successful. You have to develop resilience. Resilience is a key part of success because it enables you to navigate life setbacks, challenges, and failures without losing momentum. You see, the successful man knows he's not going to win every time. Nobody goes on a life-long winning streak. And when faced with inevitable failures, the successful man looks at him as an opportunity to learn from. He's developed a mental toughness to bounce back, learn from his experiences, and do better the next time. And when you develop this ability to persevere through adversity, this sets you apart from other guys who may easily give up when life gets a little tough. And resilience helps you foster adaptability, allowing you to make the necessary changes when the facts on the ground change. And it helps you approach life's problems with a growth mindset. By maintaining a resilient attitude, it helps you overcome life's obstacles and maintain your focus on achieving your long-term goals. Now, next up is what I believe is a very underrated trait often seen as successful guys. They prioritize time management. Time management can be a crucial part of success because it helps you maximize productivity, achieve goals efficiently, and maintain some life balance. Men who manage their time well prioritize tasks effectively. They focus on what's important and avoid distractions. This skill helps the successful men meet deadlines, achieve goals in less time, and help reduce the stress of last-minute rushing. Not to mention managing your time well helps you achieve a work-life balance. Making sure your personal life and relaxation aren't sacrificed for professional success. And by prioritizing managing time well, you often put in a better effort, allowing you to deliver consistent, high-quality results. Now, we're staying in the realm of underrated traits often seen in successful men for our next one. You will often see them prioritizing their network skills. Now, network skills can be a crucial part of their success because they can open doors to new opportunities, resources, and collaborations. Successful men who network well often build strong, mutually beneficial relationships that lead to business opportunities, career advancement, and valuable insights. Now, networking isn't just about meeting people, however. It's also about building long-lasting connections that can provide support, knowledge, and access to opportunities. Opportunities that might not otherwise be available if you didn't network. And these connections can offer you guidance, mentorship, and introduce you to influential people in your industry. By working on your network skills, you can expand your reach, enhance your reputation, and put yourself in a position as a valuable member of your profession and your community. Not to be as good as you can when it comes to your networking skills, you have to have this next trait. Effective communication. Effective communication is a vital part of your success because it allows you to express yourself clearly, build relationships, and navigate situations with ease. You see, the man who can effectively communicate can articulate his thoughts, feelings, and needs in a way that's easily understood by other people, decreases misunderstandings, and fosters collaboration. And having the ability to effectively communicate is a necessary trait in leaders because it allows you to convey a clear vision and motivate others to achieving team goals. Effective communication also involves active listening, which helps you understand other people's perspectives and builds up trust. Whether we're talking about in negotiations, teamwork, or in personal situations, the ability to effectively communicate allows you to influence, persuade, and connect with other people on a deep level. Now, next up is what I believe is a non-negotiable trait to have if you want to be successful, especially in today's fast-moving modern world. You have to have adaptability. Now, adaptability is crucial on your road to success because it allows you to navigate change, uncertainty, and unexpected challenges with ease. In a rapidly evolving world, being able to shift strategies, change focus, and embrace new ideas when necessary is very important if you want to stay relevant and competitive. Men who possess adaptability can quickly learn from new experiences, apply new knowledge, and pivot when faced with new challenges. You see, the adaptable man can often turn potential setbacks into opportunities, and his flexibility enhances resilience and creativity, allowing you to thrive in various situations and environment, and leads to a man who experiences growth and innovation. Now, next up is a time-tested trait when it comes to successful men. They almost always have discipline. Now, discipline is vital on your road to success because it drives consistent motion, allowing you to stay focused on your long-term goals. You see successful men who practice discipline have self-control, which allows them to avoid unnecessary distractions and prioritize their commitments when inevitably their motivation might wane a bit. And this steady commitment to your goals allows you to make consistent progress, turning small consistent effort into significant achievements over time. Not to mention discipline fosters other good habits, time management, financial stability, and healthy routines, all which are very important to achieve success in various aspects of your life. By exhibiting discipline, it enables you to stay on a steady course, overcome challenges, and making you much more likely to achieve your stated objectives. Now, next up is a trait seen in successful men often as a result of the other skills we've talked about. Successful guys often have leadership skills. Now, leadership skills are valuable for your success because they enable you to inspire, guide, and influence others on the path to achieving common goals. Men with effective leadership skills can motivate teams, foster collaborations, and provide a positive environment that allows other people to feel valued and driven to perform at their best. Men with great leadership skills can articulate a clear vision, make decisive decisions, and resolve conflicts constructively. These abilities not only allow you to accomplish your objectives, they empower others to succeed, creating a ripple effect in your organizations and your community. By leading with confidence, empathy, and integrity, successful men can build trust, drive results, and create a lasting impact. Now, next up without a doubt is one of the most common traits you'll see in successful men. They usually have a high level of self-confidence. Self-confidence is essential on your roads to success because it enables you to take risks, seize opportunities, and navigate life's challenges with assurances. You see the guy who has a strong belief in his abilities is much more likely to step out of his comfort zone, pursue ambitious goals, and without a doubt have the ability to persevere in the face of adversity. Not to mention self-confidence often inspires respect and trust from others, making it easier for you to build relationships, lead effectively, and to achieve desired outcomes. Self-confidence also helps you present yourself assertively, communicate your vision clearly, and make decisions without constant doubt. And this inner belief creates a positive cycle. The more you believe in yourself, the more goals you achieve, the more confident you become. Ultimately, self-confidence helps you unlock your potential and realize your ambition. Okay, so there you have it. 10 of the top things that tend to make men successful. Now do me a favor, let me know in the comment section if there are any traits that habits often seem to be successful men I might have forgotten about.

        "transcript": " So, you walk in a Sephora grab a handful of those paper scent testers and you proceed to try about a dozen different fragrances. Now, between each test, you've cleared your notes with the coffee beans provided. And it's at this point, gentlemen, if you're looking for a signature scent, I'm here to tell you you are doing it wrong. So, first up, the coffee bean thing. If you walk into Old Tessaphora any place that sells fragrances nowadays, you're going to find sometimes next to the fragrances a container that has coffee beans that if you ask somebody working there why they're going to say, well, the smell of coffee helps clear the nose. This allows you to test tons of fragrances at the same time. Now, to be fair, most of these associates are well-meaning, but the coffee bean thing is complete bullsh**. So, the history on it apparently there was an article done about a famous perfumer and the writer was in his lab and saw that he had coffee beans. She asked why he had them and whether it was a joke or whether or not he really believed it, he said he used it to reset his nose. Well, this information got out and a few companies in an effort to sell more started putting coffee beans on the shelf and telling their clients about this method. Well, I'm here to tell you there is no basis in science for this. In fact, if you understand scent masking and olfactory fatigue, the only thing coffee beans do is overpower your nose with a very strong scent. Now, if you want to reset your nose, step outside for 15 minutes and just breathe fresh air. And speaking of olfactory fatigue, that takes us to the second mistake. Thinking you can smell, interpret, and make a decision on more than a handful of fragrances. In fact, if you're just getting started, you're not a collector, I would never recommend testing more than two to three fragrances at a time. Seriously, for most guys if they want to test fragrances, I recommend spraying one fragrance on one wrist and another fragrance on another wrist and throughout the day smelling them and seeing which one you like best. I know some advanced users out there would recommend the inside of the elbow or maybe one spray in the chest area. I'm assuming though you're like me and you like to keep it simple, just go with two. Now, the reason is unless you've got a trained nose, you oftentimes don't know what you're looking for. And, yes, you can train yourself in the olfactory arts and it's amazing what you start paying attention to it, how many different smells you can pick up. In fact, there are some perfumers that have tens of thousands of fragrances memorized. But for most of us, once we've got one to two fragrances around us, we start to develop what is known as olfactory fatigue. This is when you become accustomed to the scent around you and you don't pick it up anymore. I know when I would go visit my grandmother, she's old school Mexican, she would have beans that had been sitting there for like two, probably two weeks on the stove cook and always had more beans do it. Tortillas and stuff, it was a very strong smell, great smell when you walked into the house and you smell it when you walk in. But what happens after you've been in there 15 minutes? You don't smell it at all, but you end up coming out smelling like beans and tortillas. My point being is we stop being able to smell things after a set amount of time. And this was actually an evolutionary response to us becoming accustomed to what is around us so then we can pick up a unique scent whenever it introduces itself. And, again, the breakout olfactory fatigue is to step out of that situation, get some fresh air and within 15 minutes your nose will reset itself. Now, the third mistake you don't want to make if you're looking for your signature scent is to walk in into spray fragrance on paper and think that's how it's going to smell on your skin. You see, skin and paper, two very different things. First up, your skin has a bit of a chemistry to it. Not only does it have a pH balance, but it also is going to have a little bit of oil, a little bit of sweat, it's going to have a residue on it, it has its own unique scent. So, it's safe to say even the most common fragrances out there when worn by different men by different people, they can sometimes give off a different scent because they're being mixed with a different base. And, right with that, you've got temperature. If you're wearing a fragrance right after a workout, if you're wearing it when you wake up first thing in the morning or coming out of a hot shower, you may find that the fragrance smells slightly different. And, of course, as many of you guys know, most fragrances nowadays are not linear, meaning a scent is linear if it smells the same throughout. But most fragrances are going to have a top note, middle or heart notes, and base notes. What this means is a fragrance has a life cycle. So, if you just smell it on paper, you just smell the top notes. But when you spray it on your skin and you smell it throughout the day, you may find what you smelled at the beginning is not the same as what you're smelling three to five hours in. And this is really important if you're spending good money on a fragrance because you want to, oh, do I like the base? Do I like \u2013 yeah, do I like those woody notes? Do I like those deep rich notes that start to appear? And if you do, you may find, hey, I wouldn't have given this fragrance a second look, but I love the way it developed. Or you may find, hey, I love that top note, but it's gone within a minute. Oh, my gosh, I really don't like where this thing went. The point being, if you're going to test a fragrance, test it on your body. That's why they call them testers. That's what they're there for. Now, if you get the airport, don't go all crazy and spray all over the place. No one likes to be in a confined spot with someone that's choking them out. So, what are the steps to discovering your signature scent? Well, step number one unless you want to waste a lot of money is to learn the basics of fragrance. Now, guys, I've made this easy. I've created tons of infographics that not only break out things like all the different concentrations. I've also created entire infographics breaking out all the flankers and particular lines because I know this stuff can get confusing. And if that's not enough, I've created infographics specifically for almost every fragrance release, the popular ones out there. Because let's face it, when you hear fresh, citrus, aquatic, gourmands, sweets, florals, over time you can definitely start to learn this stuff. But being able to see this stuff in charts, that sure makes it a lot easier. And, guys, all of this is free over in my brotherhood of scent. This is the best community out there when it comes to men's fragrances. I created it. I am passionate about men's fragrances. It's absolutely free. All those infographics, there are frigging courses in there if you want to better understand fragrance. And they're simple, they're easy. And I've got a new asshole policy, so everyone in there is cool, everyone in there is nice. And that's important because as you can see here, we've got a full-on community where you can go in and ask questions and actually get really good responses quick and get some great details. If you're looking for where to get the best deals, if you just want a personal recommendation or you want to share your opinion or when you wore one of your favorite fragrances and you got three compliments, yes, they were often the same person, the point is you can share these wins over in the group. So, gents, I'm linking to the brotherhood of scent. It is down in the description of today's video. Again, an amazing tool I've created for you guys because I'm passionate about fragrances and I want to help more men get into the fragrance game. So, once you've got some of the base foundational stuff and I don't think you need to go too deep, now you want to start looking for patterns. So, as human beings, the ability to spot patterns, this is something we're really good at. That's also why we've got all these conspiracy theories such as if you can pull off Alien Man by Mugle, you are not from this planet. But, seriously, I'm not going to recommend that one for a signature scent. It's a difficult fragrance for most men to wear. But what you will notice with patterns is if you go watch a whole bunch of other YouTubers which I recommend Michelle, Ash over at Gentsense, you can go check out Monica, you got Dallas over at Chaos, Nate over at Paragon, Justin Copeland, Mr. Smelly. If you're in the niche fragrances, check out Marcello over at the niche fragrance collector. And, of course, the King Jeremy fragrance especially pre-COVID. Yeah, some of his latest videos, I don't know where he's going with those. But my point being if you watch a bunch of these top ten videos and you see a pattern of a fragrance that keeps popping in to top tens again and again. And if this fragrance isn't sponsored, which by the way, nothing against sponsored fragrances, I mean, I've done tons of sponsorships and I only talk about fragrances that I genuinely would recommend. So, if you're blind buying when you see a fragrance that consistently pops up in these lists, take note because this is one you want to get your nose on. Now, Gents, if you're looking to buy fragrances online, you want to make sure you get the real deal. If you're looking for niche hard to find fragrances, then you want to get over to Max Aroma. Fragrances like M. Mikleff, I've talked about the original, Desire Toxic, this is the new, Desire Toxic Intense. It's an aromatic warm spicy green citrus fragrance that's very unique. And some of you guys know I don't normally like a cannabis note, this thing is blended beautifully. And, Gents, I'm telling you, if you're looking for some of the best fragrances on the planet coming out of the Middle East, check out the spirit of Dubai. Right here, as you can see, I've got Bosqueer, an amazing fragrance, a little bit complex. Or maybe you want something slightly different, check out Abjar Bois. Absolutely beautiful packaging, absolutely beautiful bottle. And what I love about the spirit of Dubai, these guys know how to blend notes. And on a personal note, the fragrance I'm wearing today, check out the house of Ojar specifically Wood Whisper. This is a woody powder amber fragrance with a really clean woody powdery smell that gets compliments. And besides Wood Whisper, if I would recommend any fragrance for a blind buy, check out M. MikaLefts red colorado. You got the pines with the woods. It's a very simple yet complex, absolutely beautiful fragrance. And the best thing about Max Roma is you can get samples before you buy a full-on bottle. Down in the description of today's video, I'm linking over to Max Roma with the best deals you're going to find on the web. Now, if you're really wanting to keep cost down, you need to go in and test fragrances. I know me even a small town. We've got Ulta, we've got Sephora. And I always make a point when I'm traveling to stop in at the duty free and test all the options they've got there. In addition, a while back I was in Orlando and all of a sudden I find that there is a niche perfumery. And I talked to my wife and I'm like, hey, we got to stop here because, hey, we can write the whole trip off. But, seriously, I probably spent two hours in that place and it hurt my pocketbook. But, I'll tell you, gents, nothing beats actually getting in there and talking with someone that knows a whole lot about fragrances. And if they don't, you come in armed with some information because, hey, I'm going to try that Aqua D'Joe. I'm going to get my nose on Creed of Ventus or this particular perfumes de Marley. And saying that this is the Tom Ford you need to start with. So, once you get your nose on it, you can start you really get to make an honest assessment for yourself. And, again, remember the key here is to try it on the skin. You notice what's happening here. If you don't want to spend much money, it in general is going to take more time to actually test and find fragrances. You got to understand finding your signature scent, this could take months. However, if you're in a hurry, if you are a gambling man, if you want to just, hey, I'm going to make this happen, then go ahead and look at blind buying. I know very few people that truly blind buy. Most of us when we're out there buying, we've watched tons of reviews. We're like in general, I trust that this influencer or this person is giving me solid information. I'm seeing in general it's got really good reviews. You go over to Fragrantical, which by the way is an amazing website. They've got tons of information. I really like the fact that they're bringing in AI and they're actually going through all the comments and they're giving you the summary right there at the top on a lot of these fragrances. And, of course, it's far from perfect and you're going to find a lot of the fragrances that are polarizing are going to have lower reviews than ones that in general everyone seems to love but really don't stand out. So, it may not be the best platform for finding something unique and amazing, but again, for the guy that's just starting off, it is a great place to start. Especially if maybe you've got your nose on creative antics and you're like, okay, I need to find something that's a little bit more affordable. I'm a student or you know, I've got a tight budget or I just simply want to be able to wear a fragrance and not worry about spending four to five hundred dollars for a single bottle. Well, in that case, you're going to find that there are tons of clones of some of the most popular fragrances out there. I understand that there is no perfect clone. They're all slight variations. Pretty much every perfume house, they keep their mixtures very tightly guarded. But some of these clone houses, I'll tell you they get really close and if you've worn the original and you wear a clone and you're like, you know what, this is good enough, I like it, then, hey, go for it. I personally don't have an issue with it. I mean, there is a study that talks about that if you're going for, you know, a clone or a generic anything, it can affect your confidence because you never feel like you're good enough for the best. The way to overcome this is to get a small bottle of the real thing and then just get bigger bottles of the clones and, yeah. And, gents, don't be afraid of getting those smaller bottles. I know it's not as great of a deal especially if you look at how much you're getting per ounce, but the reality is a hundred mil that will last you probably two years and that's if you spray every \u2013 there's like 1400 sprays in a 100 mil on average. So, even if you get a 10 mil sample and you spray like an average person, you're probably going to get two months out of that. If you are a heavy sprayer, you're not a sissy sprayer, as Michelle would say, yeah, she goes through 10 mil in an afternoon. But, seriously, if you're just getting started, don't over spray. Again, when you're looking for your signature scent, it's better to be discovered than announce yourself. But, Curly, I've heard that fragrance should be discovered not pronounced. Do not listen to that nonsense. And you're going to find that some fragrances they really do project. Usually you're used to relatively light fragrances, so you get your first oriental or niche fragrance that is beast mode. And I've made this mistake. I spray it like it's a fresh fragrance, yeah, three sprays in the chest area, maybe one on each arm. I mean, this just happened to me a couple months ago, my wife maybe shower before coming to bed. She's like, this is one is too much, I'm not loving it. Now, when you're looking for a signature scent, the most important person you want to impress is you. A lot of guys when they first get into fragrances, they think they're wearing it for other people, they want to smell sexy, but here's the thing is smell can have a huge impact on how you perceive yourself. There's a whole body of science of this called in-cloth cognition, but I have found that certain smells can simply make you feel more confident, can make you feel better about yourself, can almost put you in the zone. Seriously, I've created a whole course that talks about olfactory conditioning and how men can hijack the olfactory system to be able to feel a certain way. But, for the guy just starting off, believe me, you first want to make sure that you love the fragrance. After that, check if people around you like it. First up, your partner, then maybe your family, maybe other guys get, you know, get their opinions. But, hey, remember you're wearing this for you. You are going to be around yourself and you want to be able to spray something on that just gives you confidence that makes you feel like a million bucks. Oh, and I almost forgot samplers. So, a lot of times if you walk into a store, they will have samplers that they will hand out. Look for them, ask for them. Worst they're going to say is no. You'll find that they'll give you oftentimes a two mil, five mil and these niche brands are usually really good with it. Now, what about discovery sets? So, I find not all discovery sets are created equal, although the ones over at Max Roma like I've talked about those things are freaking amazing. They got so many awesome discovery sets. Seriously, it's one of my favorite things about them and again, I'm linking to them down in the description. But discovery sets, depending on the brand, you really want to look for ones that have options and those are the best ones. They can't set you back 30, 50, 100, $200. But, if you're serious about finding the right fragrance, these discovery packs, they come with five mil, 10 mil, sometimes 15 mil samples. Guys, this is seriously one of the best ways to go if you want to find the right fragrance for you and be able to take the time to do it. Now, this next tip is really important, but the majority of people do not do it. And that is when you're testing and you're wearing your fragrance, especially if you've got five, you've got a sample set with ten, write down or record, just record yourself talking to the camera what you think of the smell, how you feel about it. Because here's the deal. Over time, as you get into this hobby, you're going to find that your impressions, your thoughts are going to change as your knowledge of the subject matter improves. In addition, our memories are really bad, especially when it comes to fragrances and we're just getting started. So, you want to make sure you've got those notes especially when you've only got samples that are maybe one mil or two mil, that's only going to be enough for maybe two to three wears and you don't want to waste that wear without taking careful notes on how this makes you feel and which ones you're really drawn to. All right. So, you've zeroed in on one, you're looking to make the purchase, look at all the different bottle size options out there. 30 mil, 50 mil, 100 mil, 200 mil. Yes, those 200 mils can be a great deal, but you're making a big bet. And 200 mils is going to last most guys about four years. The reality is most people are going to be sort of probably with a 50 mil. Even though, yes, per ounce they're more expensive, I recommend you start there unless you are sure that this is your go-to fragrance, then, yeah, go ahead and get 100 mil. And if you feel they're going to discontinue it, maybe go ahead and get another. But seriously, gents, fragrances if unopened last a long time, but once you start to go through it and more and more air starts to build up in the bottle, it's that replacement of alcohol with air that causes the fragrance to start to break down. In addition, if you don't store the fragrance properly, you put it in a heat area, you expose it to light consistently. Yeah, all this can cause a fragrance to go bad prematurely although that rarely happens. But, if you want your fragrance to last a long time, keep it stored in a cool dark area at a consistent temperature and don't open it unless you're going to use it. Now, at this point, you could be zeroing in on a few fragrances that all of them could be signature scents. But, here's the deal, you don't have to make a decision. In fact, I think most men are served by owning about three to five fragrances. Seriously, maybe you want something fresh, you want something clean for your daily wear to work, something sweet, something seductive whenever you're going out with your lady, maybe a clean citrus based fragrance whenever you're heading out to the gym or you're going for a workout, maybe something higher and elegant sophisticated whenever you are getting dressed up to the nines and you want to feel like the man. The reality is, gents, once you get into this hobby, all of a sudden the whole new world opens up. It's not just about wearing fragrances, but it's about understanding scent and how it's an underappreciated human experience that now you have a better understanding of. Seriously, I was at a business conference the other day meeting with a female associate and she gives me a hug and immediately I smell her fragrance. It's either Bakarot Rouge 540 or Ariana Grande's cloud. Based off the fact that she's a professional, I assume she's got a lot of money. I'm like, you know, she's probably wearing Bakarot Rouge 540. I guessed it and she was just shocked. She instantly says, you know your stuff, no wonder you're so good. And I'm just laughing because Ariana Grande's cloud is my daughter's go-to fragrance. So, I know the scent profile really well and I recommended it to her because she was out of her Bakarot Rouge 540. But the point is in life, there are all these great interesting things that we can get into and smell, it enhances our taste. It enhances our ability to understand the world around us. So, don't be afraid. Don't be bashful. Dive into this, have fun and continue your viewing experience. Come on, guys. I got you covered. I want to learn what not to do when wearing a fragrance. I got you covered. Yeah, I didn't even touch. I barely touched the tip of the iceberg of all the things you want to avoid. How to apply fragrance, guys. Boom. I got you covered right here. Go check it out."

        "transcript": " As soon as a young girl goes through puberty, she's a woman. There's nothing more that she has to do. Whereas manhood is kind of earned, other men treat men who don't provide, who don't generate value very badly. In today's video, gents, I'm going to introduce you to one of my favorite YouTubers, Dr. Orion Teraband over at PsyCax. Now, gents, if you haven't watched any of his videos, you are in for a treat. If you have all the other things, but you don't have a spine and some balls, then you're not a man. Because they help men better understand relationships. Sex and religion and your exes and your traumatic childhood, these are things that you really should be talking about potentially on a first date. And ask questions that can change their lives. The universe is being completely deterministic. So the question is sort of like, how do people improve? Orion's advice isn't just information. It's literally a roadmap to resilience. So be careful, gents. Today's video could change your life. So I'm having a conversation with a man. And I realize he's just having trouble with purpose, motivation. Do you ever talk with people like this? And what advice would you maybe give these men that are having trouble with the struggle of life because they've done the work and they're trying to do everything right? They're just not getting the results. So there's kind of two parts to this. First, let's talk about the redoless young men. And then we'll talk about this particular example where he feels like he's tried everything and he's feeling hopeless. I think it is very important to have an overarching purpose to your life. But one of the mistakes that I made as a young man is I tried to figure out what that purpose was alone in my room. And I spent many, many months ruminating and spinning my wheels. What life do I want to lead? Who do I want to be playing chess? 50 moves out before I even made my opener. And that was a lot of wasted time because even when I came to some sort of tentative conclusions, as soon as I stepped into the world and tried to enact them, the world was like, nope. So what I often advise folks to do is that if they're feeling lost, if they're feeling directionless, to enter into a period of, let's say, experimentation, exploration, like think of life as a buffet. Try to have in a foreign country where you don't recognize any of the food. Try to have as little contempt prior to investigation as possible. Just because it looks kind of funky doesn't mean it's not going to taste delicious. Try to put a little of everything on your plate. And then the only way you're going to know what actually works for you, what you like is by putting it inside of you. You have to taste it. You have to enact it. And you'll know right away whether something tastes good or you're never going to put that in your mouth again. Right? And so to kind of explore and experiment so that you know where to go back for seconds on your next round at the buffet cart. So I think it's important to find your purpose by exploring how you feel as a consequence of moving through life. I don't think it's an abstract thing that you can decide. Like for example, my life has turned out to be very, very different from what I thought it was going to be and what I intended it to be when I was a young man. And there was sort of a grieving period where I gave up on the dreams of my youth, the life that I thought I wanted for myself to begin to embrace more fully the life that the world had in store for me and to have some sort of faith that maybe there is some goodness and some purpose to the way that this is turning out. Even though for a while during that transition, it just felt like I was failing. It just felt like I was losing because I was comparing my current progress to what I had arbitrarily decided my life was going to be when I was 20 years old. Instead of like accepting the way my life was heading and seeing what good might be on this path. Is there anything here that I can really get behind? Is there anything here that can nourish me and enliven me? And there were some things and there was a lot of dross as well. So the work from there is to kind of like be a gardener and to kind of prune the things that don't really matter and are drudgery and uninspiring and to continue to cultivate and nurture the things that give you fulfillment and curiosity and purpose, satisfaction, etc. So that's my first advice is to not think about it too much. There is a second part here with him struggling for 20 years, 10 different jobs. He's doing the work. He's just not getting the results. And it came from a tough family situation. So he didn't finish his, you know, he quit school when he was 14 or 15. He did have even a little bit of a learning disability. But you can see that this guy is putting in like he's been fighting. He's out there trying to make things. He's not giving up, but it's getting harder to not give up. 20 years is a long time. So I can understand why he might be feeling hopeless. Sometimes it takes a while to figure out why you had to struggle the way that you did. I had a pretty rough childhood in many respects and my adolescence and young adulthood was particularly difficult. But now 20 years later, that time in my life has been a source of great meaning and value that I can provide to others. A lot of the reason why I think my content resonates with people is I'm not just saying the literature says this and this is what I read in a textbook. It's like I've been depressed. I've had panic attacks. I've been heartbroken. I've been broke and I'm not those things anymore. I haven't been depressed in a long time. I haven't had a panic attack in years. I'm making great money. I have satisfying relationships. So it's like I've been in the trenches where a lot of people are and I found a way out. Now if I built a time machine, I went back to my 20 year old self and said, oh, Ryan, it's really great that you're depressed because 20 years from now you're going to be able to help people get out of depression. I probably would punch me in the face. You know what I'm saying? It's like that's not the time to share that perspective because I would be suffering and in the midst of my pain at the time. So I don't want to potentially invalidate this guy and say, hey, one day these struggles might be a source of great value for you and others, but it could very well be true. Hope is a really tough thing. And I do think that sometimes you can put it down for a while. I don't think that's the same thing as giving up entirely. I do think that we should rest before we quit. And if this guy's feeling really tired and exhausted like existentially, then maybe he can take a rest from striving towards success for a bit. That doesn't necessarily mean he's going to give up on the goal entirely, but maybe trying to push it through right now is not the right moment. There are moments in life. You talked about going bankrupt. I've lost everything a few times in my life and built it back up again. It's just like launching a ship. You go at the flood. You go at the high tide. You don't go at the ebb. So there's a certain level of discipline that requires us to act in spite of conditions, but we can't pretend that we're so omnipotent that we should be able to succeed despite everything that we're dealing with at the present moment. If I were in that situation, I would probably say, take a break. And I don't think that necessarily means that all of the efforts that he's done up into that point are meaningless. Sometimes things have this magical way of making sense in a slumdog millionaire kind of a way where all of your random experiences actually prepared you for this one moment that you didn't even know or think that you could possibly confront. I like that analogy and what makes that movie so great. Yeah. Are those unique experiences that he thought maybe he would rather not have had or he'd rather throw away in some peoples, but they come to that one point. Yeah. There's this great line in William Golding's freefall. And this is how the scar becomes a star. And I think about that a lot because I think my points of greatest value to others are precisely the sources of my greatest sufferings in the past. That's actually a value, helping people get out of suffering. That's a real thing. That's very different than like tuning their car or helping them make more ad revenue on their marketing proposals. It's like this is where the rubber hits the road. And if you can actually help people to do that, oh my gosh, it's like it could be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding vocations or professions you could possibly dream of. I think the tough part for a lot of guys, especially men, you know, we're looked at as supposed to be providers. And we know that these are the type of value that you can bring. They can transform our life, but it's not one that our society really rewards much financially, oftentimes in sims. Yeah, I do think that that can be problematic for men. For better or for worse, there isn't that kind of expectation on women. And I think that ultimately comes down to the fact that like womaness is like a given. It's almost like as soon as a young girl goes through puberty, she's a woman. She's a lady. There's nothing more that she has to do. Whereas manhood is kind of earned. Like that's why almost every indigenous or traditional culture has a right of passage that's primarily for men. It's like men are keys, the right of passage for for young girls. But for men, they have to demonstrate their courage or their competence or their strength or their tolerance of pain in order to enter into manhood in earnest. And I think that society and and I mean, not just women, but other men treat men who don't provide, who don't generate value very badly, very badly. Like that gets communicated in so many different ways every day to men. It's like if you stop providing, the world is not going to care about you. Like every day people step over men on the street. Women leave men when they stop doing that. I've had many different relationships in my life. No woman has ever left me when I was doing well. No man's life that I know is a constant trajectory upward into the right. It should trend positively, but there's ups and downs and ebbs and flows."

        "transcript": " So, in the year 1775, two important things happened. The first event occurred at a bar specifically Tontavard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And yes, on November 10th, 1775, my Marine Corps came alive. But that has nothing to do with this video. No, the event we're talking about happened in January over in Paris, France. You see, the Queen of France, Mary Antoinette, always thinking about the people got frustrated with the shape of handkerchiefs. The big problem in her mind was that they were being made in all different sizes \u2013 circles, rectangles, triangles. So, she asked her husband, King Louis XVI, to fix this. So, in January of 1775, a royal edict was issued. All handkerchiefs in France must be square. And to this day, we still call them pocket squares. But, why do we wear them in a jacket's breast pocket? How did this tradition start? What does it signify? And what's up with all the different types of folds and which one is right for you? Well, let's start this off at the beginning. The use of handkerchiefs goes back to ancient Egypt and has been documented in ancient Greece. The Romans carried them as well and they didn't carry them to blow their nose. Now, can you guess the reason? Come on, we'll give you a couple of seconds. Go down the comments, let me know. Well, a quick hint is a belief that was common for thousands of years until just a couple of hundred years ago. The belief was tied specifically to how disease was spread. You ever see those masks with the long noses used during the plague? Or paintings of people in antiquity when they were around the sick, how they would cover their mouths with a cloth? Yep, you guessed it. The ancient belief that it was bad air, that it was smell, that would pass disease led to a practice that lasted for almost 2,000 years of those with money carrying expensive, perfumed handkerchiefs to protect themselves from bad air. And so, from the perspective of somebody in the Renaissance, this was actually a very useful accessory. It not only protected you, but depending on what it was made from, how it was decorated, the handkerchief that you carried would signal your status in society. In fact, there are records of the cost of some of those handkerchiefs for those in the royal court. We'll just say the cost was more than the average person made in an entire year. And if you think about it, it makes night sound a lot more practical. You know when a maiden would drop her handkerchief, they'd go pick it up because him being a guy he's thinking, hey, that thing is expensive. What's she doing dropping that thing on the ground? I'll pick that thing up and resell it. No, on a side note, actually a lot of the times the women would actually wear the handkerchiefs in their armpits. Oh! Yeah, they had some type of fetish things going on. Almond of Sasia, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was into smells. Now, by the 1880s, the miasmic theory is starting to disappear. But still, people are carrying handkerchiefs, they got a lot of them and they already spent a lot of money on them. Well, all of a sudden, clothingers and let's say some of the fashionistas at the time, they got a bright idea. Now, gents, really quick, as I was making this video, I realized I actually have some limited edition armorist pocket squares that I had made a few years ago. Well, if you'd like to get one or when possibly some of the watches, fragrances, other men's accessories and clothing I talk about here on the channel, well, gents, you need to join our free community over at school. This is the official RMRS community. It's absolutely free. And in this group, you've got like-minded men just like you sharing their ideas, outfit of the day, giving style advice and encouragement so that you can become the man you know yourself to be. So, gents, go over to school.com slash RMRS. That's our group, absolutely free. I'm putting the link down in the description. And like I said, here's soon I'm going to be giving away a few of this pocket squares along with tons of other items. It's actually one of the reasons I created that group is I wanted a place where I could reward and give you guys the excess stuff that companies keep sending me. But seriously, it's an awesome group. We've even got free courses in there. So, if you want to learn, if you want to be able to step up your style with some quick free guides, we've got you covered over there in the RMRS community. Oh, and if you're really into fragrances or watches, we've got those communities as well, the Brotherhood of Scent and Watchlover. So, all three of those communities absolutely free, I will link to them down in the description. So, the suit jacket as we know it started to evolve out of military uniforms about 200 years ago. One of the things a lot of tailor started to add though was a pocket in which you could put glasses, you could put pens, you could put anything that you needed quick access to a ticket and they put it in a place where most men were right handed. They could reach over and just grab it. The breast pocket's original purpose was simply storage. Now, as men would store things in there, of course, you would have a few outliers, some guys say they just liked the look. And they had these fancy handkerchiefs, which at the time they used, so they would put them right in there. And oftentimes, they would hang out. Yes, most guys would probably go with a square presidential fold, but you had other guys that were just getting the puff, they were just stuffing it in there because they knew they were going to pull it out to possibly blow their nose, but more likely to protect themselves from bad air because that theory took a long time to disappear, by the way. Now, by the 20th century, we started to see media, in particular magazines, newspapers, and again, we saw the leaders of state. We would see royalty, we would see the celebrities at the time sport their jackets with a handkerchief that would be stylishly shown in the pocket. So, at this point, it started to become a fashion trend. In the 1920s and 1930s, it became a full on standard. Thanks to the men of Hollywood, we saw the best dressed men always wear on a jacket wearing a suit with a pocket square neatly folded or with a bit of spread disorder, which in case you didn't know the idea of that word is it looks careless, it looks like they just stuffed it in, but in reality, they carefully folded it to make it look good without even trying if that makes any sense. By the 1950s and 1960s, this has been adopted by all the fashion houses. If you go to Savelrow, you aren't going to see a jacket without a pocket square. Any fashion house making suits understand that the pocket square, this is the garnish on top of the dish. And as someone that's designed suits and always tries to wear a pocket square, I can tell you it's one of those small details that everyone seems to notice. And I can't tell you how many times I've gotten compliments on the square I'm wearing even when you can barely see it. And in case you're wondering, yes, in this video, I've used pocket square and handkerchief interchangeably. I would say the difference if you're out there shopping is a handkerchief is something you're going to keep in your back pocket and, you know, used for blowing. Your pocket square is usually going to be made of silk and that is the one made for showing that goes in the jacket breast pocket. And speaking of materials, yes, for pocket squares, the most common material we're going to see out there is going to be silk. Unless expensive pocket squares, you're going to see polyesters, you're going to see rayon. And, you know, I'm not going to bash those materials because I've seen some good ones and I like how they make this accessory a little bit more accessible. But, if you're going for a presidential fold, the material you're probably going to want to shoot for one that actually is going to take a hard edge is going to be either cotton or linen. I personally prefer cotton. I find that it's a little bit cheaper, easier to find, and it does a better job of holding its shape. Now, speaking of shapes, we've got the presidential fold. As you can see right here, this is one of the simplest folds out there. I like to show about half an inch to a quarter inch right above the pocket. If you're just getting started in a pocket square, go with a simple white pocket square. You may have to play around with the folds to get it to sit in there perfectly, but this is a great place to start. And if you're ever self-conscious about it, just know that, hey, you could take it right out or you can just tuck it all the way down. You won't even have to worry about it. Now, the one-point fold, this one is pretty simple. As you can see here, you're just going to have that one point up. And this one works really well with cotton pocket squares, although you can make it work with a silk. Now, if you want to get fancy, you can go with the two-point, you can go with the three-point. Again, you can make this happen with silk, but if you really want it to stay, you're going to have to look for a cotton pocket square because the silk is best suited, in my opinion, for the puff fold. And you're going to see this in a lot of my videos. I just like the puff fold because I can throw it right in there. I don't have to think about it. I've got that splash of color and, yeah, it's one of the easier ones out there to make happen. Now, what about the crown fold and winged puff? Well, this is getting all fancy and if you're into this one, guys, I've got a number of tutorials on how to fold these pocket squares. I will link to it down in the description of the video to make it easy for you. Now, at this point, if you're thinking, Antonio, man, that looks like a lot of work, why even bother? How would I even start this? So, the easiest way to get started, I'll tell you, is to whenever your jackets are hanging, this is actually where I store almost all my pocket squares. In all of my jackets, I've got a pocket square in them, so I don't even have to think about it. And usually, I make sure the pocket square is pretty simple, so I know it's going to match pretty much any shirt or pair of trousers I wear with it. But the reason that you want to wear a pocket square, I don't know about you, but I rarely wear a necktie nowadays. So, whenever I throw on a jacket, I just feel with the pocket square, it sends a quick signal that I've got style, that I pay attention to the details, that I chose not to wear a necktie. Not that I couldn't, not that I forgot to. But, simply, hey, I didn't want to and my accessory, my bit of style, is right here on the breast pocket. That's right, gents. Elegance, personal style and a bit of history all in the pocket square. If you like this video, guys, continue your viewing experience right here. I love talking about history and men's style. Guys, I got you covered. You were going to love this video if you love today's video because when you understand why we wear what we wear, it makes it so much easier to dress sharp, look good, and to be the best dressed man in the room. So, guys, go check it out. And don't forget, join our community. I'll link to it down in the description over at school. But, yeah, keep watching videos. Got you covered. Boom."

        "transcript": " So, have you ever heard of Quitter's Day? Today is National Quitter's Day. Today is what's known as Quitter's Day. Quitter's Day. Quitter's Day. So, apparently, we just passed it. It's the second Friday in January. Now, apparently, by this time, the majority of people have already given up on their New Year's resolutions. Now, I don't know about you, but I grew up around people that always told me never quit. In fact, I remember being given this drawing as a kid and hanging this somewhere in my bedroom. And the point here on the surface is a really good one, even when all hope seems lost. You've got a giant bird trying to eat you, grab onto that thing's neck and don't stop fighting. Now, I'll admit one of my guilty pleasures, my favorite football games to go back and watch on replay when it looks like a team is down and out and somehow they crawl back, get the score even and win. The funny thing about that game is I was watching it in Atlanta with a bunch of Falcons fans and I'll tell you it was not a happy night. But, here's the deal. There is a dark side to this type of mentality especially if you're a hard worker. If you're somebody that's persistent, maybe a little bit hard headed, that no-quit mentality can get you in trouble when the path you're going down is a dead end. So, when is quitting the right decision? When is it actually a pretty smart strategic choice? That's the exact argument that Annie Duke makes in her book quit. The power of knowing when to walk away. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. In fact, all of her books are friggin awesome. But, in this particular book, she focuses on the three things you need to ask yourself. When you're consistently working at something, time is going by, you're not seeing any progress and you're asking yourself that question, should you quit? Well, in the book, Annie's very clear that sometimes quitting is the best strategy because as human beings, we often fall into the sunk cost fallacy. In case you're not familiar with it, the sunk cost fallacy is a phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily into it. If you look for it, you'll see it all the time around you especially in money. I mean, think about how many times you've made a bad investment and instead of pulling out what you can and accepting losses, now you throw more money after this bad money and you end up losing more. You'll also see the sunk cost fallacy all the time in relationships. I mean, we've all been there or had a buddy who said, yeah, I've been with her three years. I just can't give up on her. I don't want to waste all that time, but here's the deal. That time is already gone. The only thing you have is now and maybe the future. So, the strategic decision here is to quit, but when to do it? Well, guys, these are the three questions you want to ask yourself. So, the first thing you want to ask yourself is the expected future benefit lower than the cost of continuing. Now, this isn't always an easy thing to see. Even with money where you got specific measurements, the future is uncertain and you may not have clear data that shows if you stick it out what the reward is going to be. And this gets even harder in relationships where we definitely don't have statistical data. So, one of the best things you can do here is get outside counsel. Maybe speaking with a financial advisor or a friend that really understands business or stocks, whatever it is you're dabbling in. With relationships, maybe talking with a counselor, talking with the therapist, talking with people you trust your friends, even getting your partner's thoughts on the situation. At the end of the day, you got to make the call yourself, but you are asking now a good question. And that leads us to the next question, do you have a kill criteria in place? Now, that's kill in parentheses when we're talking about relationships. Yeah, you don't want to go there. I don't want you going to, yeah, Leavenworth or something like that. But seriously, do you have performance benchmarks? Do you have a timeframe in which you want to try to work this thing out? Most people when they're in something whether it's money or relationships, they don't have a timeframe. So, you have to set clear conditions on, hey, at this point, I'm going to have to make a decision yes or no, are we going to continue to move forward? And, again, deciding these dates isn't always easy. Hence why most people avoid it. But, if you want to achieve greatness in life, well, setting up those if then rules is really going to help to override your emotions, which let's face it, in the moment are very difficult to combat with the logic that, yeah, we think drives most of our decisions. No, just like women guys, we are incredibly emotional with our decisions. We think it's our mind that's driving things. Now, most of the time, it's the heart. At this point, you may be saying, well, that all sounds great, but what if something changes? Well, that leads us to the third question is there new information that invalidates the original assumption. So, if you've made a decision when you are going to quit, if you've actually got a date on when you are going to quit, if these conditions are not met, well, as you're approaching that date, of course, be open to new information, new facts. And if something arises that forces that date to go farther out or come closer, then be open to making adjustments. All right. So, now, you know how to quit, but what if you don't want to quit? What if you actually you've got some pretty big goals this year and you still want to accomplish them? In that case, here are the five things you need. First up, you need to have a clear direction. An online mentor of mine, Cameron Harreld, he calls this a vivid vision. I know for me what I want to achieve where I want to be in three years, I've got it clearly mapped out with not only visuals, but specific numbers on how much money I want my bank account. How many minutes per day I want to be exercising focusing on my fitness? How many days a year I want to be taking vacations where I want to be going? And, by the way, this isn't just random information. I used to have an entire vision board which I distilled down into one page and every single day I sign it and date it. I do this because I'm confirming I took steps towards achieving my vision, my goals in life. You've heard it before and I'll say it again, a journey of a thousand miles begins with that first step. Now, I'm taking nothing is more motivating than seeing the progress build up. Now, the next thing you want are clear step-by-step directions. So, it's all good to have a vision, but if you don't know how to get the body you want, if you don't know how to improve your finances, you could fall into the trap of analysis paralysis. So, what I've done over the last 40 years is sought out coaches, mentors. I've read probably over a thousand books, taken hundreds of pages of notes. In fact, my first blog, a tailored suit which I then later built real men real style out of was nothing more than my notes that I was writing out is I was trying to learn more about menswear. I then transformed into a blog that one time was getting like 2 million visits a month, but in any case having clear step-by-step directions, which again, if you don't want to do all that reading you can shortcut by finding somebody that's already walked the path and having them show you. That guy, those directions are key to being able to make it happen. Next up, you need real accountability. It always kind of makes me laugh when I see these apps out there that, you know, beep, buzz. Yeah, accountability apps are okay, but real accountability happens when you respect somebody enough that you don't want to disappoint them and you show up day in, day out to do the work. I know for me that's why I've always paid my coaches. Even when I was coming out of a bankruptcy, I would find a way to scrounge up a little bit of money to be able to hire a coach because when you pay somebody money, it's a form of respect. It's a form of commitment and real accountability as you know goes both ways. They, of course, need to respect you. You need to respect them and mutually you agree to work together to achieve your goals and to help you do what you need to get done. Next up, you need a supportive community. Anyone that's ever been in a group fitness, you know how it is. Everyone else around you, they're cycling, they're moving, they're stretching, they're lifting. Guess what? You fall into it. When I played organized sports, it was so motivating to be around everybody working out, exercising, and that continued into the United States Marine Corps. People ask me all the time, oh, you must be disciplined because you're a Marine. No, I was in the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps itself is a disciplined system. And when you're in a system, when you're in a group like that, you're going to find that you can't help but have that culture rub off on you. So, if you want to get in shape, put yourself in a group. If you want to improve yourself as a man, as a person, find a group of men that are trying to do that. When it comes to improving your finances, wealth building, find a helpful, knowledgeable, positive community where guys are going to support each other because when you fall down and it will happen, it's so great to be able to look up and to see hands coming down to pull you right back up. And this next one is often looked over, but it's really important and that is to have a group of people that you can celebrate your wins with. So, one of the reasons that CrossFit is so popular is that these people just love celebrating wins with each other. In fact, if you're not even part of that gym, if you're just near it, you're going to hear them coming around celebrating their wins telling you everything about CrossFit. Yes, and we get tired of it. For a lot of us guys, as we lose our friends over time and we don't stay in touch with people, it's hard to be able to talk to people about certain things that could come off as bragging. So, if you got a new job that doubled your pay, maybe you got a bonus or maybe you made an investment that did really well, a lot of guys find that they can't really tell anybody about this because it feels like bragging or it actually when you tell somebody this, you're worried they're going to ask you for money. When it comes to you celebrating a moral win, something that maybe improved your character. Well, who do you talk to about that because most people don't even seem to get it and they're not even trying to improve themselves in that area of their life. Well, gents, if you've made it this far, I encourage you to go a little bit farther and check out what we're doing over at Health Wealth Purpose. Over at Health Wealth Purpose, we have all five of the components I just talked about in our community of like-minded men looking to become their best selves.

        "transcript": " So, the amazing stylish boot I'm going to reveal in today's video has been around for over a hundred years. It's got an equestrian heritage and is incredibly masculine. They're also incredibly comfortable. You can dress them up, you can dress them down, they're versatile. And these boots have a storied history being designed to solve a problem, to fulfill a need at the moment. Now, if you know your footwear, you may be thinking, ah, Chuckas, the classic desert boot developed in World War II by Taylor Sinkiro because the British soldiers at the time wanted a more comfortable combat boot. Well, that's a good guess and Chuckas are great boots, but they're just too casual to wear with the suit. The boots I'm talking about today, you can actually wear with a casual suit. Oh, so you must be talking about Chelsea's. Again, good guess, but wrong. But, no, Chelsea's are comfortable, they got great boots, but the boots I'm talking about in today's video have even more style. So, the boot I'm talking about originated in India in the early 1920s. At the time, Polo was a popular sport with the British officer station there and they needed a healed pair of boots that could keep them in the saddle and also would have high ankle support with the ability to stay on the foot. These boots also needed to provide a degree of protection and as a bonus, it'd be nice if they were comfortable. Not only did this custom designed boot meet all those requirements, but it went on to be spread beyond India becoming popular both in England and throughout Europe. In fact, in the 1930s during Hollywood's golden age, it started to even crop up in the United States in movies. Custom designers and Hollywood stars loved this riding boot that was not only useful when you were riding a horse, but was incredibly comfortable when you were walking in and around the set. Mixing the western fashion houses in the 1950s and 60s looking for inspiration from equestrian inspired footwear, this functional sportwear boot became functional with stylish men in the know. The boot style I'm talking about in today's video, the classic Jodhapur. Now, the name of the Jodhapur boots has its roots in the city of Jodhapur located in Rajasthan, India, which in case you didn't know has a long equestrian and polo playing tradition. Now, the boots aren't actually named after the city. They were associated with the Jodhapur breaches also known as polo breaches that were developed prior to the boots in that city. And since these boots accompanied those breaches, they picked up the name Jodhapur as well. As you can see from the videos and pictures right here, these were my go-to shoes. These Jodhapurs whenever I was traveling in New York just this last Christmas time, I wore these boots everywhere. They were the only boots I took. I think my fitness tracker recorded 15 miles walked over three days in these boots and they held up well. They were incredibly comfortable and they worked seamlessly with all the outfits I wore with them. In the situations, I put them in. We went to a lot of dinners, even went and saw the Rockettes at the Radio City Music Hall highly recommended by the way. And speaking of New York City, let's talk about today's sponsor, Thursday Boots. I have been to their headquarters in New York City. I've met with the founders. I've been talking about Thursday Boots for years because I genuinely love these boots. I wear them all the time and I love the fact that they have great styles that got all different types of boots, all different types of shoes over at their website and you can get high quality boots at a fair price. And, gents, if you haven't been over to the website for a while, you are in for a treat. They got all new styles whether you're looking for Western boots, dress shoes, Chuckas or Chelsea's. If you're looking for boat shoes, if you're looking for brogues, if you want brogue boots or just a classic lace up like their diplomats or their captains which I highly recommend either one of these would be the boots that I would recommend you start with. And to make sure you get the best deal on the web, use that link in the description of today's video. Seriously, gents, you guys know I take care of you. I've got the best deal. Using that link, go over to Thursday Boots, tons of style options. And again, you get one pair. You get your size nailed in as a guy that has over a hundred pairs of Thursday boots. Yes, I have a lot of them. I can tell you that the size is consistent across the board whether you're wearing their dress shoes, whether you're wearing their Western boots. But in the case you need to make a return, you need to make an exchange, Thursday has your cover. So, gents, for the best value in boots when it comes to price when it comes to getting great quality, check out Thursday boots. Just be careful because when you get over there, you see all the different styles, all the different colors, all the different great looking boots that when you wear, you're going to get compliments, guys, it's hard not to grab more than one pair over at Thursday. But in any case, gents, again, use that link in the description of today's video. Go over to Thursday Boots. They're a great company. I'm proud to support them. Go check them out. Again, use that link. Otherwise, what makes up a Jodhpur boot and what makes them unique? So, the most distinctive feature on a pair of Jodhfurs is going to be the leather strap that wraps around the ankle. Now, as you can see here, like on any shoe on the upper here, we've got the vamp and this larger area right here is called the tongue. Now, notice on this pair of boots how the tongue has two straps, one that's really long and another one that has a buckle. Well, in order to keep the boots on the rider, the Jodhpur boot was designed to have a permanent leather strap that would go around the ankle and cinch it tight, keeping the boot in place. Now, as you can see here, there's a slot on the front, there's a slot on the back, so you can actually loop the straps and even the buckle side through. Keeping that leather strap neat, tidy, looking good, and the overall design on this is simple, elegant, and timeless. In fact, this design right here is why I think the Jodhpur can be dressed up more than a pair of Chelsea's. I mean, seriously, I know a lot of Chelsea's if you haven't noticed there's going to be a contrast. You've got this elastic material right here. For a lot of people, this is what makes the shoe just, yeah, a bit more casual and very difficult to wear in a lot of people's minds with a full on-suit and tie. Now, if you go for a black pair with almost no contrast, yeah, you can easily wear this with a casual suit, even a full on-suit if the weather is pushing you in that direction. But, yeah, a shoe like this is versatile, you can dress it up, but if you want more style, look over to the Jodhpur. Man, that strap right there, the higher support around the ankle, even the overlay right here on the front, it feels more like a dress shoe. And I'll tell you, man, these things are stylish. Now, besides the wrap around strap, when it comes to Jodhpur's, another detail you're going to notice is that these are higher boots. They're made to go up at mid-angle. And because you've got that strap that's going around and tightening it, these boots are going to offer some pretty decent support. In fact, if you're coming over from a pair of Chelsea's, you're going to feel Jodhpur's feel a lot more like their laced cousins than they do the lower cut Chelsea's or Chaka's. Now, historically, Jodhpur's have had a natural toe. That's going to have that rounded almond end right there. You're not really going to see any Jodhpur's out there with a square toe. We see this occasionally in Western boots and usually that's there so that you could kick livestock or you could kick something to get it moving without causing too much damage. Now, the rounded toe is preferred because it's perfect for being able to easily get your foot right into an English saddle. Now, the heel on a Jodhpur boot is substantial. We're talking at least an inch, but it's not going to be like Western boots. Western boots especially cowboy boots or riding boots, we see heels that can be up to two inches. You'll also see this on Chelsea boots with Cuban heels. But, yeah, unless you're going to be riding with Jodhpur's all the time, you really want that lower heel that inch to three quarters of an inch. And if you're going to be buying a pair, look for a heel that's going to have a rubber sole. It doesn't have to have it throughout the boot, but really right there on that heel and you want something that's going to give you traction and a bit of cushion. Now, when it comes to style, we're going to see a classic calf skin that's polished and overall, we're going to see sleek minimal stitching. You're usually not going to see any broguing. And, again, I really like this simple clean design because if you polish this thing up, you can easily dress it up. Now, because these boots have a higher shaft, you can wear them with trousers that have a little bit of a higher cut. That being said, as a man that wears Jodhpur's, I've never adjusted any of my denim or any of my pants and these work perfectly fine especially if you don't have too slim of a taper and you'll find that right here at the top of the shaft unlike Western boots, these things are going to fit very close to the leg. And so, with that being said, I would recommend that you wear at least calf length socks that are not going to fall down. You want to make sure you have some of that sock between your ankle and the boot. Although, on these ones right here by Thursdays, they've got a really nice soft inner lining so it probably wouldn't even be an issue. In fact, the only reason I think you want to have your hand just a little bit higher is maybe to show off the footwear what you're wearing because, again, when I think of Jodhpur's, I think of shoes that pretty much only rock stars wear. Yeah, Jodhpur's you got to have confidence. They give like a rock star type vibe especially if you're going to wear something like a green suede right here. I've had these ones for a while. I love them, but I don't wear them as often as those brown ones. They're a little bit more versatile. But these, man, they are they're just so much fun. Now, I talked about dressing them up, I talked about dressing them down. Now, as you can see here, my dark brown Jodhpur's when I was traveling in New York, I wore them both with a pair of tan and dark brown trousers. These mole skin pants had a bit of a napped surface and they kind of fit the middle ground. To me, they're more stylish a little bit dressier than khakis. Now, if I wanted more of a dressed up look, I probably would go with a black pair of Jodhpur's. I'm wearing with a gray suit maybe with a black turtleneck and an overcoat. Maybe stick with those dark browns, a navy blue suit and perhaps a navy polo and maybe even a contrast jacket. Now, what about dressing down? This is where I think Jodhpur's have a really fun advantage. I know so many of you guys just, yeah, you like your dark denim and you're like Antonio, I'm not going to be wearing these things with a suit. Then wear them with your best jeans. Heck, I think if you're in shape, you can wear this with a V-neck t-shirt or if you're not so in shape, put on a Henley, throw on a casual jacket. Overall, we've got a much more rugged but still stylish look. Now, what's the drawback to wearing Jodhpur's? Well, as a traveler, I would say they're not as easy as Chelsea's. Chelsea's I can slip on and off. Jodhpur's you do have to go down there and undo the strap. I'll tell you though, this is a lot easier than Laces. And I have to say on my most recent trip, it actually wasn't an issue at all, but, you know, that's a small deal. I know some of you guys just don't want to reach down at all. Now, I'll also say you really got to take care of them because Jodhpur's because they've got that long leather strap that is actually part of the boot, you don't want it to dry out, you don't want it to crack. So, you are going to want to make sure if you're wearing these things a lot that you are conditioning and you are polishing, but this should be pretty much on all of your nice footwear. If you want it to last, condition it, polish it, and use shoe trees. Because in case you don't know shoe trees, what they do is they pull out a bit of moisture, they make sure to keep the shoe shaped in a way that looks good without getting all types of bumps and wrinkles on the leather. That being said, if you do have all types of bumps and wrinkles on your leather and you want to be able to get that out, guys, I got you covered in this video right here. It's actually I got a lot of tips and tricks. I love talking about shoes, so I got you covered, guys. Check it out. Solid video right here. Hopefully, you enjoyed this one. Let me know if you got any questions about Jodhpur and, yeah, keep watching. Boom, right here. I got you covered."

        "transcript": " So, this modern generation, they're soft, right? They're not financially independent, they're still living at home with their parents. They're totally shielded from hardship, they don't really know how to cook their own food, they're overly sensitive, they want to cancel everything, they don't even know how to hold a conversation. Seriously, they text each other in the same room. When I said soft, I also meant soft literally. Statistically, they're the most obese generation ever. In fact, I think these quotes sum it up. All they love is luxury, they've got bad manners and contempt for authority. Younger generations are soft compared to the warriors of the past. Now, looking at those quotes, it wouldn't be a bad guess if you thought I pulled them from Reddit or the comment section here on YouTube. But, the reality is those quotes are about 2,500 years old. Seriously, those quotes are from old Socrates and Juvenile. Now, I highlight this because I want to make an important point. This video is not about bashing modern men. In fact, I'm going to argue that modern men are relatively tough and that as a generation, they're facing challenges I'm happy I didn't have to face at their age. Now, the real point of this video is to share with you an insight that I had the other day at a party as I was talking with a group of parents about how easy or difficult depending on who you spoke to this modern generation had it. Now, before I share with you my arguments why I think this generation has it tougher the most and why I think they're doing a great job, I want to first address the elephant in the room and that is why is it so common for one generation to bash another. Specifically throughout history, the older generation usually bashing the younger generations. And to prove my point, here are a series of quotes over thousands of years. Yes, again and again, what are we seeing generation after generation after generation going back a thousand years going back 500 years going back 50 years going back 2,000 years. We see that every older generation is bashing the younger up-and-coming men for doing things that they seem to be immoral, irreverent, and almost always incredibly lazy. So, why do older generations tend to bash the younger crowd? First up, we've got nostalgia bias. This is when you romanticize your youth. You focus on hardships as character building exercises. Now, the problem with this bias is it skews comparisons between what is happening now and what happened in, yeah, that rosy past. I saw this all the time in the Marine Corps. You talk to the guys that have 10, 15 years of like, yeah, talking about the old core somehow wasn't nearly as tough. Now, for anyone that served in my opinion in general, that's a bunch of BS. Yeah, you've got exceptional generations like the guys that served in WWII. But, overall, in my experience when guys were called up when they were put in combat situations, I saw it firsthand. I saw men and women step up and do what needs to get done. And it didn't matter if they joined in the 80s, the 90s, or 2010. If a person has the core values of honor, courage, and commitment, it doesn't matter if they're Gen Z or Gen X, if they've got my back, I'm cool with that. Next up, we've got the perceived decline of values. And for a lot of people, this one seems real. It does seem the younger generation doesn't have the same work ethic and they don't have the same respect for authority. However, when you look at this issue and you see it's being brought up for thousands of years, you actually see just simply the values are shifting. I'll tell you one thing I think I've noticed with this younger generation, it's not that they don't have a work ethic, it's they're actually looking for a challenge and they want to be motivated. They don't want to blindly follow bad leadership right into the ground. Now, really quick, gents, I want to introduce you to today's sponsor BetterHelp. And, gents, in case you didn't know, BetterHelp is the world's largest online therapy service. With BetterHelp, you can tap into a network of over 30,000 licensed and experienced therapists that can help you with a variety of issues. And to be straight up, gents, I've used their services because I've got issues just like anyone else. I like to think of myself as a high achiever. I put a lot of pressure on myself. I've got seven kids, I've got multiple companies, and just like you, I deal with the ups and downs of life. And, guys, I can tell you from experience, talking to a therapist helps because taking care of your mental health is no joke. And, BetterHelp makes it easier.

So, gents, BetterHelp is a no-brainer. To get started, go over to betterhelp.com, b-e-t-t-e-r-h-e-l-p.com slash rmrs to make sure you get the best deal on the web. And finally, let's talk about the technological divide. Now, younger generations, they see people using chat, gbt, and all this AI to be able to do their work and they think it's going to make them stupid. You know, in a way, I sort of agree with this and I do think TikTok and short-form videos have not done much for the intellectual abilities of most. However, the same arguments were made when washing machines came out or maybe a better example is the calculator. I mean, you need to be able to do all that stuff by hand. If you're relying on a calculator, you aren't going anywhere, they said. Now, the dangerous part here is that there is an illusion of truth. You can selectively take some statistics and you can clearly show that the use of calculators or now the use of AI is making people dumber. I mean, the data is pretty clear that this latest generation is physically soft. They are more overweight than any generation before them and so, it would probably be better if what they were moving, maybe they had jobs, they didn't have them sitting in front of a computer all day. Now, I can't argue with those facts, but what I can bring to your attention is the fact that statistics now are used as a tool of persuasion, not a tool for figuring out what is the truth. By that, I mean, if you've got a belief, you're going to fall oftentimes into confirmation bias. You are going to go out there and look for facts that confirm what you believe. And the internet makes this incredibly easy. If you want to believe that the earth is flat, you can type in, yes, you'll find a lot of stuff that is showing you it's not, but you will, there's probably something out there that will substantiate what you want to believe even when it's something crazy. Hence, why we get all these crazy conspiracy theories. And yes, I know some of them are true such as that God speaks to us through creative ventis, but seriously, if you understand statistics, you understand that you can always find some truth in numbers and that by quoting out a context using small sample sizes or not understanding the difference between correlation and causation, which in case if you don't know correlation is when two things happen at about the same time, but one of them does not cause the other. Example being during the summer, we see more shark attacks and more ice cream sales, which if it's not obvious, ice cream does not cause shark attacks. If it did, that would be causation, which if you wanted an example of that, we could have taxi usage and rainstorms. And if you've ever been in New York City in a rainstorm, you know that it's almost impossible to get a taxi because rainstorms cause usage to go up. My point in all this, though, is that most people don't understand statistics. And in the world where you've got marketers and I admit I am one of them that know how to use this to actually be able to influence people, we often see people using numbers to be able to create stories, drama, conflict, where there actually isn't any. And, gents, that's a really important point which I'm going to get back to here in a minute, but let's talk about this latest new modern generation. What are the problems that they face that I think actually they're doing a pretty damn good job? But before we go there, I want to address the areas I think most people would argue that this modern generation is relatively soft about. I'm talking about the areas of life, the actions we see this younger generation taking that a lot of us over the age of 30, 40, 50, well, we consider their approach soft, but is it? First up, we've got physical fitness. I've said it multiple times, this modern generation is the largest, the most obese, the most overweight. They're also not performing as well athletically as what would be expected. If anyone follows sports, what they probably are noticing in a number of sports across the spectrum, less and less records are being broken. In fact, it seems like in general, modern athletes aren't pushing themselves like athletes were in the 80s, 90s, and the early 2000s. So, if you look at that data, it's pretty clear, right? They're soft. However, the counter argument to that is look at the fitness culture that we've got today. Look at all the different ways that people are staying in shape, redefining what it means to be healthy. Realizing that maybe going after extreme records and pushing yourself too hard too early actually leads to a breakdown when it's better to find non-competitive sports and exercises that are going to keep you healthy into old age. I mean, when you look at the number of men that have gotten into yoga, gotten into hiking, alternative sports, the number of guys participating in CrossFit and they will tell you if they're in CrossFit, but seriously, I mean Spartan races, all this other stuff, I mean, if you look at it with that perspective, in addition, this generation is paying attention to their blood work. They know about their testosterone levels. They're starting to pay a lot more attention to what's going into their bodies. I mean, in a way, you could argue that this generation is incredibly healthy. Let's go over to work ethic. A lot of guys, especially business owners in their 50s and 60s, say they can't find anybody that's willing to just show up and do the work. A lot of companies say it's difficult to be able to get people to come into the office and work 40 to 50 to 60 hours. A lot of people don't want to work overtime or they don't want to work jobs in the trades that are going to be having them use their hands. On the flip side, maybe you've got a generation that actually prioritizes other things instead of work. I have to admit I'm a recovering workaholic. I, in many ways, define myself by what I've accomplished professionally and by the amount of time, the amount of effort what I'm able to produce with my companies. I've talked to a lot of younger men that really this isn't their dream. They don't want to get into the hustle culture. They don't want to work themselves to the bone or into an early grave. I've also spoken to some other young men that, you know what, they don't want to work jobs that are boring to them. Yes, they could make some money here. They could go this route, but they don't want to work under a bad boss and they definitely don't want to work eight to 10 hours a day. So, they've in a way doing something isn't going to bring them any fulfillment and trap them into a path which they've seen their dad wake up 20 years later and regret doing. I've also met some younger men that are working 80 to 100 hours a week doing what they love, setting up their own businesses, going out there and getting rental properties and building and investing there and working with their hands, learning the basics of plumbing, carpentry, roofing and everything that goes with it and loving that type of work because it's fulfilling and they're doing it for themselves or for their own business. So, I don't know, maybe this new generation's got it figured out. But, these younger guys, these modern men are soft because they need to talk about things. They're offended whenever you say something. They're triggered. They need to go to therapy and talk it out. I'll tell you, growing up in West Texas around a lot of guys that didn't say anything and they would just keep that anger in and eventually explode and blow up like a volcano. You know, I'm not sure that old way of doing it, of keeping it all inside is the right path. Now, I will agree there are some guys out there that are just a little bit too emotional. I don't need to see you breaking down on TikTok and you're posting it every single video. But, man, there's something to be said about being able to open up to be able to talk about things especially when you've got a group of peers, if you've got a support group, if you've got a therapist, if you find someone, if you find a process that works for you, it can be life-changing. So, in this way, yeah, I'd have to say some modern men take it to an extreme, but I like that we've now got this option and that it's much more acceptable. Now, earlier in this video, I talked about that this came out of a conversation I had with some other parents. And what I saw is a lot of the other parents just trashing on their own kids and it was frustrating because I know that these kids are dealing with issues. Like I said, I've got seven of them. So, in typical Antonio fashion, I actually took the opposing view and I talked about all the things and it actually surprised me that the parents hadn't really thought about this. I think about all the things that these kids are facing, these young men are facing in today's world that we didn't even have to worry about. First up, let's talk about the unhealthy food. Have you ever tried going into a grocery store and buying something that isn't infused with preservatives or sugar? Good luck finding anything in the cereal aisle. In fact, in the entire inside of the supermarket, it's a freaking set of landmines. There isn't really anything healthy inside. You've got to go to the fresh food, you've got to go to the meat, you've got to go to the eggs, which is a hack in of itself. Just shop on the outside of the grocery aisles and you're going to probably do better than buying anything on the inside. Next up, let's talk about the overwhelming choice. One of the moms, she's like, oh, he's got so many more opportunities than I ever had. And I'm like, yeah, exactly. He has unlimited opportunities and that is stifling that can paralyze people. When you see all these options, I mean, we know this a lot of you guys out there dating, you see this again and again, you get in a relationship and she wants to continue dating because she wants to, you know, play the field. She sees all these options or you fall into this trap. You're always like, you know what? It's not perfect in this relationship. I'm going to move on to the next one. You know what? No relationship is perfect. Every relationship is work. I mean, being honest, I can't imagine what it would be like for my 18 or 22-year-old self to have all of these options on the apps or just simply career-wise. This could be tough. This could be paralyzing. The overabundance of choice, this is a real dilemma that people face. And, yeah, I can't say that I would like to have it or that I would have done as well as I did if it had been put in front of me. Next up, isolation in a connected world. Yeah, we're talking about two people being in the same room texting each other, but, yeah, their social skills haven't developed. And we've also set up conditions at schools. I don't know if you've been to them lately, but everyone's on computers, they're not using the books anymore. They're sitting in these desks all day, have very little time to socialize. On top of that, there's a constant comparison. Everybody is on Snapchat, they're on Instagram. They are comparing themselves especially women and men. Are you know, hey, he's got six-pack abs, that guy is built well, he's super tall. Never before in human history if so many men felt inferior based off a measurement they have no control over. And let's face it, any of you short kings know it does not determine your happiness. And the sooner you realize this, the sooner you can break free of those chains. But it's difficult because society is consistently hitting you with these messages that you aren't adequate, that you aren't good enough, that you don't measure up. Throw in the 24-7 news cycle that's creating all this anxiety about, you know, climate change or school shootings. The hyper-consumerism where you got to be a millionaire, you got to have the money, you got to buy the streetwear to fit in, you got to be able to afford the vacation, they'd be able to take the pictures with your girl. Oh, and all of this with a lack of privacy because if you make a mistake, it gets caught on video and everyone sees it and you get shamed into oblivion. Gens, I don't know about you, but I am happy. I grew up in the time period I did and this takes me to the point I really want you to take away from this video. And it's that whether you are Gen X, whether you are Gen Z, you're a millennial, you're one of this new betas. I think they're just being bored. A horrible, horrible name, but, yeah, it is what it is. Wherever you may fall in the generational divide, I don't think there should be a divide. I really want to see more men lifting up other men, people helping each other, taking the steps to cross that divide, offering mentorship. Guys in their 50s, mentoring guys that are in their teens, helping them see what's out there and overcome the difficulties and also getting them up to speed on technology and all the new tools that make incredible things possible. Gens, we're all the same fighting this battle and our enemy is not each other. No, our enemy are those that are trying to divide us and keep us apart, keep us from unifying because if we did like a closed fist, we would bust through and make this world a better place. So, gents, if you enjoyed this video, let me know in the comments below and don't stop watching. I got you covered here at Real Men Real Style. If you enjoyed this motivational video, I've got you covered with more. Check out this video right here. Very emotional one I did a while back, but still one of my better videos and something I think is important just that a man is able to express himself. Yeah, it's a good video.

        "transcript": " So, one of the big style mistakes we're going to see guys consistently fall into this year are the baggy blues. Basically, wearing clothing that's ill-fitted that's way too large. And the reason a lot of guys are going to fall into it is it's a fashion trend. So, as they're out there shopping they're going to see this type of style displayed and they'll be straight up they're going to be people around them they're going to push them into this fit. Now, if you're a fashionista, if you're into trends and you can wear this with full confidence, go for it. Who am I to tell you what to wear? But if you're looking for a timeless style that's going to flatter you this year and ten years from now, then you want to make sure the clothing you buy complements and fits the body you have. And the best way to do that is to purchase timeless pieces whether they're formal or casual depending on your personal style and make sure they fit you and your body type when you purchase them. And if they need to be altered or adjusted, go ahead and have that done. The next style mistake I've been seeing out there is logo overload. I'm just for the amount of times I've seen this in the last month, I could probably create a show flashy branding gone wild. Now, but seriously, the size and the placement of logos on clothing seems to be going a little bit crazy especially in the casual and street wear scene. Now, I get it some people not you like to show off what they're wearing. And in my advice if you are going to sport clothing with a logo, try to select a brand that keeps the logo muted or relatively small placing it in a tasteful area. But, yeah, unless you're getting paid by the brand, keep the logo at a minimum. Next up, let's talk about shoe shame. We're talking about worn out footwear that definitely shows signs of neglect. The biggest offender here are dirty shoes that aren't being kept clean or maintained and protected from the elements. Your white sneakers that are now gray and have stains on them? Guys, come on, there are options. First up, just simply clean them up, wash them, see what stains and dirt you're able to get out. If need be an easy hack here is to replace the laces. Dirty laces do nothing for a good look and pair of shoes. If you've got scuff leather or disc coloring, there are special tools and polishes to whiten the shoes back up. And, of course, all this applies to leather boots and shoes as well. I know when it comes to wearing leather dress shoes in the winter, I'm really careful of salt stains. After everywhere, I go over my shoes with a wipe to remove salt and after a few wears go over and recondition the leather. This helps to soften, moisturize, and protect the leather. The same thing with boots, even though they often use a heavier, more durable leather, you still got to keep them clean by removing the dirt, removing the salt, moisturize the leather after a half dozen wears, and apply a polish which more importantly than the shine puts on a thin layer of protectant to insulate the shoes from the damaging elements out there. Which again, salt being the number one culprit to cracked leather. The next mistake I'm seeing out there, the collapsed collar. You know what I'm talking about? Those lifeless shirt collars that after a single wash wrinkle up like a piece of bacon or the weak lifeless ones that hide whenever you throw on a sweater or a sports jacket. Gents, the purpose of wearing a collar shirt is to use the collar to frame the face. So, why even own a collar shirt if it's not going to do its job? Well, gents, if you've ever dealt with any of those shirt collar issues you need that you got today sponsored, collars and coat. Gents, the founders over at Collars and Co were guys just like you, they got tired of every day having to wear a collar shirt that was uncomfortable, they didn't layer well and simply put these guys knew there had to be a better way. So, they took the structured collar of a dress shirt and they put it on a polo creating the dress collar polo. Here's me in New York City traveling with my family. I wanted to look good. I wanted a shirt that would layer well with the sweaters I'd brought that was breathable and made from a stretch material that I didn't have to worry about ironing. Gents, collars and coat perfectly fit the built and solve the problem. That's one of the things I love about collars and coat. There's so much more than just shirts and collars. In fact, if you haven't been over to the website, check out their knitwear you are missing out. Seriously, right here as you can see I'm wearing their Heather Cloud Cotton Quarter Zip Pullover which this cloud cotton material has to be felt to be bleached. It's incredibly soft, very warm. That being said, if you're looking for something a little bit heavier still in the casual side, check out their Kenna Bunport Cotton sweaters you can see I'm wearing it right here in green. And if you really want to step it up throw on a blazer, check out their Maverick Performance Blazer. I've worn this in a number of videos including when I was out traveling went and visited my buddy Rafael Schneider over in Minneapolis. He asked the guy over at the Gentleman's Gazette and I took this blazer with me threw it right over a polo and I love how it fits. It's wrinkle free. It has a really nice drape to it. All that being said, gents, if you're just getting started grab one of their dress collar polos. Maybe have a little bit of fun with your collar choice. They actually come with a wide range of selections here whether you want semi-spread, English spread, button down or cut away. But, going with that dress collar polo for me it was navy. This is the first thing that as soon as I started wearing it I wore it again and again. Now, gents, to get started use the link in the description of today's video. You guys know I take care of you. I make sure Collars and Co gives you the best deal. Go over to Collars and Co. Awesome company. I've been talking about them now for years. I love how they started on Shark Tank. Mark Cuban put a million-dollar investment into this company. Again, gents, use that link to get the best deal on the web. Go check them out. Collars and Co. Great company. Hi, gents. So, the next mistake you want to avoid the accessory avalanche. Now, for a guy just getting started this usually isn't an issue. A lot of men aren't really wearing any accessories. Maybe a wedding ring, maybe an Apple watch, but a funny thing happens is you start to get in the style. You're like, you know what? I like having a nice watch. All of a sudden, you find another ring that you throw on your other hand. You start wearing bracelets. You decide to live on the wild side and bring in a necklace. And before you know it when it comes to accessories, you're looking like Johnny Depp in a Savage commercial which, hey, if that's your thing, go for it. But for most of us, I'm going to say keep it simple, keep it balanced. And in general, try to understand that less is more. There's nothing wrong with owning ten rings. You just don't want to wear them all at once unless you're the Mandarin. The same thing with bracelets, the same thing with necklaces. I think a well-dressed man with a lot of accessories, what he does is he rotates through. He knows which accessories work with which outfits and he treats them like a spice used to pull out the flavor not overwhelming. Next up, let's talk about the trend trap. The whimsical wins a fashion if caught your attention, you're over on TikTok, you see a look you like and you want to incorporate this look into your wardrobe. It may be a color, it may be a particular item, it may be a whole new style. Now, whether you're a 15 or 55, I'm not here to tell you you can't pull off that look. I'm here to tell you that chasing these trends can be a trap for your wallet because the items you purchase here are most likely not going to be in style within one season. So, just be aware and understand you're warned. Which, by the way, is one of the reasons I press classic style. A lot of people think classic style is boring. Well, gents, if you understand time with style, you know it's anything but. Now, when I think classic style, I think the utilization of lines and silhouette that have been proven throughout history to help a man look amazing. That style worked for your father, it worked for his father and it'll work for you. Because that style isn't going anywhere, you can spend a little bit more money on it and get great quality. Which speaking of which, let's talk about counterfeits and let's talk about low quality knockoffs. Now, if you ever hear the word fast fashion, what it's referring to are large brands like Zara that were able to see and take what was on runways and in a matter of weeks get it into stores. Now, previously this process if it had happened fast would take six months to a year. So, the speed now in which companies are getting fashion trends out is really remarkable. But, there is a dark side, the obvious one being a lack of quality and in some cases some questionable manufacturing techniques. But in any case, one of the big reasons you should be wearing a fast fashion is just simply the quality of the product is usually poor. From the material used in the garment to the stitching and the way it's put together, these garments aren't made to last. Especially with counterfeits, we've seen this of course in Rolex, but you see this in fragrances, you see this in streetwear. Any place there's a buck to be made, you can bet that somebody is going to put out a counterfeit in order to get some of that action. Now, counterfeits can be notoriously hard spot. Hence why if you're really brand conscious, it's sometimes best just to buy directly from the brand. However, I find a lot of cases if you just simply look at the inside of the clothing. If you learn a little bit about the product, if you do just a bit of research on what to look for in counterfeits, you should be able to spot them in most cases. Especially when a deal seems way too good to be true. Next up, we've got the faded fiasco. This happens to some of our favorite clothing. You know what I'm talking about? That pair of black jeans, that favorite hoodie that you just love and you wear and you wash. Well, after you do this 50, 60 times, guess what? Well, those black jeans are no longer black. That red hoodie is now, yeah, it's a shade of red, but it doesn't have that strong vibrant color in life it used to have. Well, sadly, whenever you throw your clothing in the wash, whenever you throw it in the dryer, all that limp material that you see building up, guess where it comes from? Your clothing. You've got to understand that when you wash your clothing, you are in a sense shortening the life of that garment. And depending on the quality of the build and how rough your wash cycle is, you could find that your favorite shirt isn't looking like your favorite shirt just after a few washes. Now, no, the solution here is not to wash your clothing. Instead, it's to pay a little bit more attention to the tags and wash your clothing in a little bit more of a delicate manner. I highly recommend to most people to spot clean your clothing and really ask, you know, I wore this hoodie for a couple hours. I can probably go without washing this time. Or in the case of a pair of jeans, can you wear it at least a few times before washing and do you have to throw them in the dryer? Could you just hang dry them? These small changes can double the trip of the life expectancy of your clothing. Now, I feel this next mistake is obvious, but I still see it being made again and again so I need to mention it and that is proper maintenance of your clothing. I'm talking about an iron, a steamer, knowing how on a sweater whenever it starts to peel, which naturally happens on sweaters over time, although cheaper sweaters, it will happen sooner. Simply knowing that you can take a razor and just simply go over to remove the peeling and get that sweater looking good. Now, when it comes to ironing, I know a lot of guys don't like it. So, I think it's a good idea to make sure, again, to read the label on the shirt, but if you're in a hurry, you're going to be layering, then just focus in on the collar, maybe on the cuffs of the shirt, the front area. But a hack of clothing maintenance when it comes to ironing is actually to get a steam iron. Steam does a great job and it can be you can steam wool. You don't really want iron wool clothing, but you can steam clothing including sweaters and it loosens it up to go back to its original form. And this works in wools and cottons and it causes the wrinkles to fall out. Known as it also reduces the chance that you would damage the clothing. And really quick, let's talk pockets. Guys, you're not a pack mule. You don't have to fill up all your pockets. I get it. I like to be prepared. But, I find as an American, I'm usually driving most places, so I just make sure everything I need to be prepared is in my vehicle. It's usually pretty close. And for the day-to-day things I carry, I always try to really slim it down. I try to identify what do I really need. And, yeah, be careful especially on your formal clothing of using those pockets because it can start to deform and even cause it to hang and drape in a way that isn't flatter. Now, if you feel I miss something, it's probably because I hid it in this video. So, yeah, continue your viewing experience. Yeah, go check it out. I got another video, guys, for you right here. And, yeah, make sure that you dress well. I've got you covered. The mistakes you want to avoid, oh, yeah. Boom, right here. Keep watching. Solid video, oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " So, my wife and I were invited to a party the other day. It was a bit of a fancier when it was in a nice venue they had sent out invitations, but they weren't specific about the dress code. Now, I knew the host, I could read between the lines, I knew that I was going to wear a casual suit and my wife was looking great in a beautiful dark color dress. Now, when we arrived, what we found is there was a wide range in the attire. The women for the most part were dressed eloquently. In fact, I can't think of a woman that wasn't wearing a nice dress. The men on the other hand, yeah, this is where the range was. Now, nobody was wearing anything embarrassingly bad, but it was clear that a lot of the guys really didn't put a whole lot of thought into their outfit they were underdressed. Now, gents, I'm not here to judge other people and I encourage you to look past clothing, really try to get to know people don't judge a book by its cover. However, the reality is most people do judge a book by its cover. Most people make a decision about you based off what they see. And the big problem I see for a lot of men out there is that they don't have the courage to be the best dressed man in the room. And I say that not in a way to make it sound like a competition, but instead to highlight the fact that many men out there even when given the time even when their partner dresses well, they choose for a variety of reasons to dress down or to dress in a way they always have. Now, there's a great HBO show called The Newsroom and you've probably seen the clip where Jeff Daniels states, I is not the greatest country in the world, professor, that's my answer. Now, he says this statement to a lot of proud Americans, it shocks them and then he goes in to make a point. And his point is the first step in solving a problem is to recognize there is one. Gents, the problem I want to raise awareness of in today's video is that the majority of men out there do not realize the importance of their image. We go out there and we spend tons of money on our education. We spend a lot of time gaining experience. We approach a problem with enthusiasm. But when it comes to our nonverbal communication, our ability to send a message with our image, our style, the way we dress and the way we present ourselves, a lot of guys out there, well, let's just face it, they are dropping the ball. You've got that great friend, good guy spends all the time in the gym, has a great body, but wears clothing that just, yeah, it just makes him look bad. While this begs the question, why do so many men not understand style? What's holding guys back from being the best dressed man in the room? Actually, to be more specific, they're best dressed selves. Because here's what I'm shooting for. I want you to look great whether you wear a suit, whether you're wearing casual clothing, I want you to be able to put your best foot forward. And in today's video, we're going to identify the economic, the psychological, the cultural and the practical reasons why most men choose to not dress well and how you can overcome those obstacles. So, the first reason why most men aren't dressing well is that the majority of men around them do not dress well. The reality is that we are social creatures. You may think you independently think about things now. You are taking cues all the time from the people around you. If everyone in your friend circles wears a baseball cap, a t-shirt, and jeans with running shoes, guess what? You are going to fall in line. An experiment after experiment has shown that human beings are incredibly susceptible to the actions, behaviors, and dress code of those around them. And, yeah, I said dress code even though it's an unofficial dress code, very rarely nowadays, even that party I went to the other day. There wasn't a dress code. They didn't lay it out. I always think it's easier when they do. But the thing is we still look around. We take cues, we look. If you go into a casual environment, you start to feel out of place if you are dressing at a higher level. If you walk into a party and everyone is dressed to the nines and you're not, you're the odd man out, you are going to feel a bit odd. You are going to feel underdressed. And, of course, no surprise here that in the West, particularly the United States and Canada, we have seen dress codes just become more and more casual as we've gone towards at Leashwear, as we've worked more and more at home, as the casual Fridays of the 80s turned into the casual week of the 90s as turned into pajama month by the year 2010. In fact, nowadays when I'm out wearing a sports jacket, people think I'm wearing a frigging suit, which there is a big difference between a suit is a jacket and trousers made from the same material, a sports jacket or an odd jacket as the name implies a non-matching material with the trousers. In any case, as society as a whole became more casual, started dressing down and carrying less for style. Even if you tried to maintain your own standards, it became increasingly difficult as those around you continue to dress down and all the environments we find ourselves going to, the overall dress continues to go down and in general is geared towards comfort. And I did bring up that italics in comfort because I think that brings up another reason why a lot of people aren't dressing well is a lot of guys assume that dressing well is somehow uncomfortable. Now, in defense of the ten-year-old that is forced to wear a piece of clothing that he's not used to and it's not nearly as comfortable as a t-shirt. Yes, he's got to wear, you know, that tie he doesn't know how to tie it's way too tight. He bought this, his mom bought him this shirt when it was, you know, two years ago he's grown it. Yeah, this is incredibly uncomfortable. And some of you guys that occasionally have to wear a suit maybe at a wedding you're like, man, I do not like this stuff. It's way it doesn't fit well, it doesn't feel just wearing this necktie for a few hours all of a sudden you've got redness around here. Yeah, in this case you're wearing a costume, this isn't clothing actually made to fit you. So, that's why it's uncomfortable because most likely it's using actually poor quality materials and the fit is not good. However, whenever you buy quality men's clothing that's made to fit your build, actually you put it on there's no hot spots, it's actually made from a luxurious material maybe it's going to be wool, a really high-end cotton that is very comfortable and you get used to wearing it. And that's a really important point because a lot of times we're not used to, if you're not used to wearing a particular type or style of clothing, you're not really uncomfortable in it you're just unfamiliar with it. And over time the more times that you wear it you become more and more familiar. It's like going into a gym for the first time. You don't know where any of the equipment is at, you don't know how to use it, buy it the tenth to twentieth time you've been in the gym you start to feel like a regular, you know where things are at, you know how the workouts are supposed to go. The same thing with dressing well, you understand what works with what, how things should be layered, how the fits should be. And all of a sudden you become very comfortable, all of a sudden you start liking the fact that people call you sir that people actually notice you when you walk into a place. They assume you're the man in charge because you look like the man in charge. And that takes me to the next reason I think a lot of guys don't dress well is they are oblivious to the fact of how important it is for us to dress in a manner so that people make a positive judgment about you whenever they see you. Now, I know some of you guys out there saying I don't care what people think about me. They should be able to see into my heart and know that, you know, I've got that fancy degree I've got all that experience. No, people don't have time for that. You don't have time for that. There's a whole field of science about this heuristics basically how we use mental shortcuts as human beings to be able to navigate the infinite. I mean, there is just too much information. So, we break things down and we use these, you know, these prejudices we use these shortcuts to be able to say, okay, I'm going to go this, I'm going to do that. Usually this has worked for me, it works about 90% of the time because, yes, there are anomalies out there, but usually when you meet a person and they're dressed in a certain way, your idea of success whatever your field may be, you've, okay, I know that this person normally dresses in this manner, so I'm going to be able to use that quick shortcut, save my energy and to be able to move on. When you understand that that's the way most people work day to day, all of a sudden you realize, well, this is a hack simply dressing in a manner that I project the image I want to. And seriously, there are tons of professions that do this whenever you're getting on an airplane, you see those guys board early, the pilot and the stewardesses, guess what? They are dressed in a certain manner. If you had a naked guy running to, you know, a building and say, everyone get out, we're going to call the cops, you're going to think he's crazy, you're going to call the uniform professionals. But, if a uniform professional who looked like a fireman came in and said, everybody get out of here, what are you going to do? Everyone's getting up and they're getting out of here based solely on what we see. And so, when a guy understands, hey, you dress in a certain manner in certain fields, you're going to be able to close more sales. You are going to be able to send a signal of authority. People are just going to question you less and you're going to have to deal with just less a-holes. All of a sudden the rewards and the incentives for a person to start dressing better, they're there and that's what I love when a man realizes, yeah, it's not about the style, it's not about being a fashionista, it's about using your clothing as a tool to get what you want out of life. Now, some of you guys that work from home are like, okay, Antonio, that doesn't apply to me at all. I don't go anywhere. And then, in that case, I still would recommend that you dress well, that you shower, maybe put on a favorite fragrance that you dress in a way \u2013 who you're dressing for? You're dressing for yourself. And there's an entire field called in-cloth cognition. Classic study here, they had a group of students, they were like 500 of them. 250 were told they were wearing doctor jackets, the other 250 were told they're wearing painter smocks. They took a test. Guess what they found? Those that thought they were wearing doctor jackets were more attentive and therefore their mindset was in the right place, they scored statistically higher on their exams. Now, don't confuse my point. I'm not saying to start wearing a doctor's jacket whenever you're taking a test. What I am saying is understand that the clothing you wear actually affects the way you perform. Think about it with athletes. If you were to have, you know, some of those top soccer players go out wearing a ballerina's tutu, they're not going to probably perform as well because they're wearing the wrong clothing, they're going to feel out of place. The same with you. And they've even shown this actually on video. If you haven't showered and you think you smell, your confidence level is lower and they've shown this, yeah, they have a whole study on this. And again, I've done this research, I see it again and again and I want to encourage you whenever you've got that important meeting, actually get ready for it, dress well for it, even if the camera is not going to be turned on, you know and you feel good and you are going to be able to perform at a higher level. Now, if you're nodding your head throughout this show like Antonio, this all sounds great, but I'm still not going to improve my style, I'm not going to look good because I don't want to stand out from the crowd. I get it. And the desire for human beings to fit in, this is primal. I mean, we go back, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of years. If you were thrown out of the tribe, this was pretty much a death sentence. But here's the thing, as human beings, we often internalize and we overthink and we think what matters to others actually, it really doesn't matter to them. If you want to be that guy that has the reputation to say, hey, be in the bow tie guy, be in the guy that maybe dresses a little bit better, this actually can be to your advantage. Years ago, when I owned a custom clothing or had a client, he worked over at Microsoft and he was pretty much the only guy that ever dressed well. And guess what? When Bill Gates was in town, was having a charity event, they were like, who actually has a black tie outfit because the event was like in three to four hours, they wanted to send somebody from his division. Guess what? He was the only person, he was not the most qualified person to sit with Bill and Melinda Gates when they were back together. But no, he was the only, he was just simply the person that was prepared. So there is an advantage to actually standing out and having that courage. Again, I'm not going to say stand out in a negative way, but I do think if you are well put together, you've got your own individual style. Maybe it's going to be vests, maybe it's going to be you've got a particular type of shoe that you want to wear, whatever works in your environment. Find a way to be able to bring it in and to make that style yours and don't be afraid to stand out from the crowd. Now, this one's a little bit more serious, but some guys just have a negative body image. They've got the pear shape, they've got the bigger, wider hips, they don't have much muscle on the upper body. They're like, man, I just simply want to wear baggy clothing that hides everything. Well, here's the thing is baggy clothing, it just makes you look it just makes you look like you're wearing baggy clothing. Instead, if you've got that type of build, where clothing actually is going to build up your shoulders is going to maybe slim up the hips. There are particular cuts, there are certain styles of clothing. Again, that's why I like classic clothing. Sports jackets whether it be a casual jacket whether it be a sports jacket or a blazer jacket, this is going to build up the shoulders. It's going to make the hands look larger. Depending on, you know, the cut of the back of the jacket, you can actually get something with no vent which is going to slim up the hips around the hips a bit. My point being is no matter what your body build is, you can find clothing that better suits and makes you look your best for the body you have right now. Whether you are tall and skinny, you're short and stout. You know, if you are you don't want to look big and sloppy, you want to look large and in charge. That's what we're shooting for here like the kingpin, right? Seriously, when it comes to ethics, he's got something to improve on, but Fisk when it comes to style, the man has it. Next up, we've got judgment and reaction. So many guys don't want to dress differently, don't want to dress up because they don't want other people to judge them. I like Newdy Cohen's point. He was this amazing the rhinestone cowboy look he actually built out in Vegas, amazing Ukrainian immigrant. I would always say it's better to be looked over than overlooked. And when you embrace that, that people are going to judge you. Well, you might as well be judged as looking good. So, at the party the other day, yes, I probably was one of the, you know, best dressed guys there. I wasn't afraid to look great with my wife. I knew we were going to take some pictures, we were going to be spending some time together with others. And I had a number of men and a number of women compliment me, wow, you look great. And it feels good. And you just simply learn to be able to say thank you, say I appreciate it, you know, I do, you know, people know what industry I'm in and what I do for a living. So, it is, it's like, hey, I live up to the brand. But, point being, it's just learn to be able to accept the compliment and know that if people are going to judge you, they're at least going to judge you with someone that cares, someone that puts in the effort maybe in their mind a little bit too much, but, you know, that's more on them than you. So, what about time constraints? What about convenience? Is it harder to dress well? I don't think so especially if you lay out your clothing, if you design a wardrobe, if you build things out so that you can simply walk in. I always talk about the interchangeable wardrobe, but one of the things I talk about with that is also being able to color block. As you guys probably have seen, most of my jackets, you know, I've got reds right here, I've got browns. Whenever it comes to my trousers, they're usually going to be in grays. My shoes are going to be dark browns, but I keep this pretty consistent. Yes, I've got some blue jackets as well. My shirts are mostly going to be whites, they're going to be blues. These colors are, you know, some people may find boring. I find it just easy to be able to go in there and mix and match and to be able to build pieces out again with an interchangeable wardrobe. You can own less, you can get more. It's going to be three pairs of shoes, three trousers, three shirts, and three jackets. Now, the goal here is for you to have three solid outfits with all 12 of those items. See how it goes right across? Three, three, three and three. Instead of three outfits here, we actually have 81 outfits because everything is 100% mixable, meaning that every pair of trousers works with every pair of shoes, works with every shirt, works with every jacket. Let's talk about the excuse. I don't know where to start. I don't know how to dress better. Guys, come on. I give you so many tools here free on this channel, but if you actually want a guy down in the description of today's video, I'm going to link over to my style system.

        "transcript": " So, there are two conflicting narratives as to the origin of the pea coat. I'm going to share them both with you and let me know in the comments which one you feel is more plausible. The first is that the pea coat comes from the Dutch word peach referring to the type of material used to make these jackets, which was a blue wool on the outside being a very tough twill weave and on the inside being a napped wool with a much softer surface. Now, the word jagger referred to a shorter coat, one is a jacket above the knee. The pea jagger was eventually adopted by the British Royal Navy in the 1800s and eventually became known as the pea coat by the end of the 19th century. Now, another theory as told by the United States Navy and favored by me as a U.S. Marine is that sea jackets from the 1600s were made from a material called pilot cloth. It was a heavy coarse stout twill blue cloth with a napped surface on the inside, very similar to the Dutch one, right? Now, apparently this material was sometimes called pea cloth and the jackets made for them were called pea jackets. This would later be shortened to the pea coat. And adding a bit of credibility to the U.S. Navy's version, the term has been used, it was documented as far back as 1723. In any case, I think we can all agree that for over 300 years the pea coat has been helping men stay warm and dry in freezing cold weather and look stylish at the same time. And remarkably, over the last few hundred years, the pea coat really hasn't changed too much, which is a great thing and I promise I'll explain why in a few minutes. But, first, let's define exactly what a pea coat is. So, what makes a coat a pea coat? Well, the first and probably most distinguishing feature is going to be that a pea coat needs to be double breasted. A double breasted jacket is going to be a jacket that's characterized by two vertical rows of buttons. Depending on the size, length, and the style of the jacket, you're going to see anywhere from four to eight buttons. Now, historically speaking, the reason that you would use the excess material on a double breasted jacket is the overlapping flaps would do a better job of keeping the cold out and keeping the heat in. The next distinguished feature of a pea coat is going to be the broad lapels. And these broad lapels aren't just for show, they're actually made to fold up into better and close and protect the wearer's neck. In fact, if you think about it, these things are a little bit of a time capsule, a vestige of the past. There really isn't a lapel style out there on any other garment that is quite like the pea coats. Now, the next style detail of the pea coat is going to be its length. It hits right at the hip well above the knee. Now, of course, this depends on the cut of the jacket and the height of the man wearing it, but in most modern jackets, we're going to see an elastic either right around the waist or maybe a more formal longer overcoat. We're going to see it going well past the knee. And, yeah, if you look around, there are some other jackets that hit at about this length, but the pea coat's length, especially in a sea of shorter coats and longer coats, yeah, I still think it's really distinctive. And speaking of lengths and cuts, let's quickly talk about the bridge coat and the reefer jacket. Now, the reefer jacket was a specific type of pea coat that was issued either to an officer or a petty officer on a ship. It had the same design as a regular pea coat except it had room for epaulets here on the shoulders and it had gold buttons. Now, a bridge coat was a reefer jacket, but actually extended it went down to the thighs. These longer jackets gave greater protection and they were designed for officers who weren't going to be up in the rigging and didn't need to, you know, have the full mobility that a pea coat offered. And that takes me to the next distinctive property of a pea coat is you are going to have in general high armholes. These jackets are made for fit men. I say that not to dissuade anyone out there that is a little bit maybe bigger and wants to wear a pea coat, you probably still can. But, in general, these jackets were designed for a young military man that was going to be mobile and able and therefore they cut the jackets in a way that they would fit less body types, but the ones that they did fit, they would make it look really good. And that's probably why so many men who wear pea coats look good to them because in general, to be able to pull off this look, you do have to have a good build. So, it's kind of that whole self-selection circle thing going there. Now, the material historically on a pea coat was going to be wool and they chose wool for a reason. If you don't know the properties of wool, wool has this really interesting ability to be able to absorb almost its weight in water and still feel dry. Untreated wool as well has a thin layer of wax that actually does a good job of repelling water, so you weren't even getting much in it to begin with. And, as many of you guys know because you have wool sweaters, wool has great insulating properties. So, it is going to keep the heat in and keep the cool out. Now, when it comes to color, modern day pea jackets, you're going to see a variety of colors out there from camel to black, but historically speaking, we were going to see these in a navy blue. The navy, U.S. Navy, I know did issue black pea coats as well, but if you want to go for something classic and I think incredibly versatile, yeah, you want to go for one of the darker colors, navy is just I think the best one to start with. And I alluded to it earlier, but let's talk about buttons. You're going to see silver, you're going to see gold. I've seen white naval buttons out there. Nowadays, on most pea coats, we're actually going to see plastic buttons, nothing wrong with that. I personally like them because they're durable and they're muted. They don't really grab a lot of attention. The gold ones are just a little bit too much for me. And, last but not least, the vertical hand pocket. You know, the navy was pretty smart. In the Marine Corps, they always said, you know, never put your hands in your pockets. The navy, they got a little bit of sense. They were like, you know, if your hands are cold, put them right there in the pockets. And so, every pea coat has that slanted spot for keeping your hands warm. Now, I mentioned earlier, it's a great thing that the pea coat has been around for over 300 years. Why is that a good thing? A lot of guys thought it's really it's an old outdated style. No, I promise you any modern man that pulls off a pea coat is going to get compliments. This jacket, when you wear it, it builds up the shoulders, it slims up the silhouette, it makes your chest and arms look bigger. This is a great jacket for getting compliments. The great thing with this being a classic piece having been around a few hundred years is the Lindy effect. Basically, the longer that something has been around, the more likely it's going to continue to be around. We see this in business all the time. A business that's only been around a year, well, you know, is it going to be around in a year? We don't know. But a business that's been around 50 years, well, it's more likely to be around another 50 years. The idea here is if something has stood the test of time, if it has continued to be around and be able to deal with everything that life and the world throws at it, well, it's probably not going anywhere. And this is a great thing for you. You see, because the pea coat isn't going anywhere, you could actually go out there and find one that you like that fits you well that may cost a little bit more, that may be a little bit expensive. But here's the thing, you buy quality in a classic piece like this, you're going to be able to wear this jacket next year, five years from now, 10 years from now, in 30 years. Your kid is going to steal this jacket, see like, damn, this looks good. Dad, I'm taking this. But, seriously, gents, that's why I love classic menswear. When you find pieces that just work with your build, with your silhouette, that make you look good, that get you compliments every time you wear them, you shouldn't be afraid to save up or to spend a little bit more. To get what you want and to be able to dress in a way you project the image, you project the style that you feel represents who you are and what you stand for. Now, what to wear with a pea coat? It really depends on the style. The one I have right here, actually you can barely see it. If you get up close, you can see the pattern. So, this one right here is a relatively light weight, almost like an overcoat. I could wear this with a casual suit with a blazer and chinos with a sports jacket and a pair of jeans. Now, if I had a heavier maybe a vintage navy pea coat, that one right there, I probably wouldn't wear with the suit, but you definitely could wear it with the sports jacket and jeans, a quarter zip with a collared shirt and jeans or chinos and easily pull off with a Henley dark denim and, yeah, that classic pea coat. Well, I think overall a great look. All right, gents, what to watch next? Boom, I got you covered right here. Yeah, check out this video. You want to look great? I got you covered with, yeah, another solid video right here at Real Men Real Style. Enjoy, guys. I will see you in the next video. Take care."

        "transcript": " Now, what you probably know about layering is when it comes to style, it is a proven way to level up your game. What you probably don't know is how to layer clothes properly when the temperature drops. Seriously, learning a layer can give you a lot of options when the temperatures fluctuate and if done properly, it can look amazing. Now, with this combination, as you can see, I have a lot more options because when I'm hot, I slide this jacket just right off and that would probably happen pretty soon unless I'm outside. But, I've also got these multiple layers here. I've got this double breasted jacket which is going to look great in the office, but let's say it does get hot in the office and I just thought, hey, I'm going to peel that off as well. I still actually have this extra layer, this sweater on top, so that, yeah, they keep the office a bit cool. It's a lot better than just having that shirt. Next up, let's talk about how layering can help you look amazing and that most men never use this to their advantage. So, the key with layering is understanding the subtle difference in textures and patterns. So, when you look at right here, what patterns do you notice? The paisley right next to my face, helping to frame the face and we have a solid. Then we have a green with a bit of a texture and that's what you notice. The texture right here in the corduroy, you've got those ribs, it's a cotton fabric, but it's not like the cotton that's right next to my skin. This cotton is nice and smooth. We've got a very tight weave. Then we've got this wool right here with that very soft texture and it's that combination right here. All close together, layered on top of each other, which just gives a really nice uniform look. Layering is layered properly and you can stand out from the crowd and look awesome. So, let's talk about your outerwear. Depending on where you're at in the world, you've got to know your climate, but if you're going to have rain, if you're going to have sleet, if you're going to have snow, if you need something like a shell that's going to be water resistant, then that's what you need to have. Next up, you've got to think about what's the temperature going to be. So, after I've got my shell, after I get off that top layer, I like to have an insulation layer. So, your insulation layer and there can be multiple insulation layers. This is about keeping in heat and that's what insulation does. It doesn't allow heat to escape. It also doesn't allow the cold to penetrate. It stops the movement of energy. So, when we take this off, again, notice I've got another warming layer. So, I've got my sweater right in here and then I've got my shirt and let's get down to the base layer. So, underneath this, I have an undershirt and I have underwear. The next mistake is not understanding the limitations of certain materials. Now, I love suede, but if it rains a lot in your area, you're in Seattle, you've got to understand that suede is probably not the right material for you to be wearing as outerwear. Instead, you want to go for something that's probably going to be more practical. Just a regular leather is going to be a better option or maybe going for a synthetic material that's going to naturally breathe and also repel the water away. Seriously, just because it's wintertime doesn't mean you need to go big and bulky. Now, you need to understand what's the purpose of the jacket. I've got an overcoat that is made to actually be worn over a suit, a little bit heavier, a little bit bigger, a little bit bulkier than this right here. But this P-coat, when I actually saw this thing, I was like, you know what, I'm going to go with a little bit closer of a fit. But I love it's a very thick, very tough wool and this is a work jacket. And just because it's cold outside, don't forget about accessories, sunglasses to be particular. So, you got all that snow out there, you're driving, guess what? It is brighter than normal because all that light is being reflected off the white right into your eyes. In fact, if you know the history of sunglasses, the Inuit people up north, they were actually the first ones to come up with the idea for sunglasses and they used wood sunglasses. They just had a very small slit that you could barely see through, but it would help and prevent all that glare from coming in and hitting the eyes. Nowadays, you want to make sure that you're taking care of your eyes. Now, what about the head? This one, most of you guys have a watch cap and you're going to it, but why not have a little bit more fun? Why not actually bring in a cap that maybe has a little bit of insulation, keep your head warm? At the same time, bring a bit of style to your outfit. I don't know. What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments. Hat number one, hat number two, or hat number three. Now, when it comes to layering, the first rule is to keep it simple silly. Seriously, you don't need to overcomplicate this. You're not some Instagram post. You're not necessarily a Facebook model. So, don't think that you've got to layer five items. Guys, two to three is perfect. Look at this outfit I have right here. I've got my base blue shirt, then I've got my green knit, and then on top of that, I've got a brown leather jacket. Keep it simple. You don't want to make this overly complex because then you're not going to enjoy the process. Rule number two, gentlemen, thin to thick. Basically, bulkier clothing on the outside, more form-fitting clothing as you get closer to the body. This makes sense. If you think about, you are throwing clothing on top of each other. It makes sense. The thinner clothing needs to be closer to the body. The thicker clothing then goes on and the bulky heavy clothing goes on top of that. If you try to reverse this, try to change it up, you're going to start to have fit issues. You're going to have pieces that just aren't working together. You're not going to be able to move in the clothing as well and effectively layer. And it just doesn't look as good. Rule number three, gentlemen, if you're looking great and a layered look is to fully leverage all the different materials, all the different weaves, all the different textures, all the different fabrics that are out there and the emotions and the feelings that they convey. You've probably heard me in other videos talk about leather and how it sends a signal of strength and masculinity. I've also probably talked about some of the nap services we see on knits and we see on certain shirts that make people want to go in there and touch. So, think about that. You're wearing something that's rugged that makes also people want to get close, women especially and touch. If you're going on a date, why not have a rugged but approachable look? You see how this all plays in and that's the power of layering. Rule number four to layering clothing, gentlemen, is understand every layer should be able to stand on its own. What does that mean? It means that you don't want to wear something that if worn by itself, it just wouldn't fit, it wouldn't look good. I know there are some hacks out there and you can do this in a crunch where, yes, you could wear a well-fitted sweater over an ill-fitted shirt, but I still think that if someone, you know, if you look at the back, you can sometimes see the clothing crinkling up underneath. I truly believe that every time you layer, every single piece should be able to stand on its own. Rule number five, let's talk about layering patterns. Layering patterns is very similar to matching patterns. What you don't want to do is go with two patterns right next to each other. So the great thing about wearing knits is that knits most of the time, they've got their own distinct textured pattern. They oftentimes don't have like different large patterns that repeat themselves which you would see in shirts. So that's why I like knits that kind of offer a very safe buffer. But if you're going maybe for a jacket that's got a herringbone weave in it, then you don't want to have a shirt that's got a herringbone weave especially if they're going to be similar. So if you're going to wear a striped jacket or you've got something that has stripes maybe on the sweater, you want to be careful about wearing similar sized stripes in the shirt. It just doesn't look as good. Rule number six, tuck in your under layers. And I'm talking about your shirts here. So a lot of guys think that if they're going to layer, they can untuck their shirt. This can work if you're an advanced layer and the shirt isn't too long. But once that shirt starts to go past the crotch area, if it covers your backside, if it looks like a dress, it's just not a look I think that flatters most men. The net can be untucked jacket. Obviously, you're not tucking in your jackets. And if you're an advanced matcher, you are in the street wear. You know what you're doing when it comes to layering. Sure, go for it. Have fun with it. But to me, this is a bit advanced. You can really mess this up. Again, if you know what you're doing, it can work. But I think for most men just starting off, it's better to tuck in that under layer. Now, this next rule is something that you never stop doing. See layering inspiration. So, subscribe to magazines. Go check out Pinterest boards. I particularly, I've got a copy of Esquire right here. I subscribe to GQ. I've got a number of other magazines that are sent to me. Start putting together curating different looks that you like. At the end of the day, this has been done before very successfully by many men out there. So go out there, look at what they're doing, be inspired, and there's nothing wrong with going out there and learning from the masters. Well, gents, here's the deal. If you're a man in your 30s, 40s, or 50s, look at the level yourself up to find a community of like-minded warriors out there trying to improve their health, wealth, and purpose. Well, gents, if that's you, you need to check out our new community, HWP. Over at HWP, we've got a step-by-step program to help men become their best selves. I've developed this program over the last decade, leveraging my experience as a former officer of Marines, business owner, and father. The reality is when you're 35, 45, 55, it's very difficult to find like-minded men looking to improve themselves. At HWP, we've got a supportive community and we embrace the idea that daily through small actions, if you just get better by 1%, over the period of months, you're going to see compound improvements and take measurable steps towards becoming the man you know yourself to be. Gents, if this all sounds interesting, down in the description of today's video, go check us out. I'm putting a link over to Health Wealth Purpose. Or you can just type it in your search bar, healthwealthpurpose.com. And, yeah, you can learn more and see if this program is right for you. Quick note, this is an invitation-only group, meaning that you need to go through an application process. And I personally look over every application and do the interviews because we've discovered that it's really important we get the right fit, the right type of guys that are going to bring in the right energy, guys that are willing to show up and do the work to become their best self. Also, the average age is about 48 and there's only 20 men in each class. So, don't wait, apply today, use the link in the description of today's video and we'll get back to you. So, first up, let's talk shirts. When it comes to casual shirts, you've got the t-shirt, you've got the handling. Both of those are great summer options in the winter not so much because they're immediately going to be covered and you're going to lose the art of layering. So, what I lean towards is a shirt with a collar. Now, in general, three options here. You have dress shirts, you have casual button downs, and you have polo shirts. Now, the traditional options when it comes to layering are going to be a well-fitted dress shirt or casual button down. Either one of those, assuming it is a good fit, you could slip a sweater right on top of that and put a jacket and even a coat on top of that. These can work really well. Next up, gents, let's talk sweaters. Tons of options out there, but let's first start with the different style of necks. You're going to see crew necks, you're going to see v-necks, you're also going to see button mock necks, half zip mock necks. And one of my personal favorites, turtlenecks. Now, all these examples I just showed you are pull over sweaters. You are going to see some sweaters that button all the way in the front. These are known as cardigans and they come usually with two different types. You've got the standard collar cardigan, then you've got the Charlotte collar cardigan. Now, in general, when it comes to layering, I love the v-neck because it's going to do a great job of showing the collar. If you're going with a crew neck depending on how tight it is, you're probably not going to be able to easily show a collar all your handsome times if you're wearing a necktie and if it's a little bit loose. When it comes to the turtleneck, no, you don't want to wear a necktie underneath this. This is when you can wear just a casual t-shirt or even a long sleeve Hanley on this underneath it. But, yeah, usually with the turtleneck, it's going to be that turtleneck which is going to draw all the attention. And still, it's a great look. Now, when it comes to those different styles, I think that body type plays a lot into this. The v-neck is going to be the most versatile if you are a rounder, a larger guy, or even a skinny guy, a v-neck especially layered with a collared shirt whether you wear a necktie or not is a great look. Now, when it comes to that crew neck, this is harder for rounder guys, bigger guys to pull off. They still can especially if it's a little bit, you know, just got a nice fit to it. But for skinnier guys, that crew neck is going to be something that looks good especially also for thinner guys, they can pull off the turtleneck. Now, can a larger guy pull off a turtleneck if he has a longer neck and if he's not overweight? If it looks like you have no neck, do not try to pull off a turtleneck. It's just, yeah, not a great look. That being said, if you think you can pull it off, if I feel like Antonio, man, I can make it rock, then you go for it. Now, for a man's first two sweaters especially those he's going to layer with, I say keep it simple. There's a reason I default to gray. Why it's a non-color, it's easy to dress up, dress down to match with a wide variety of colors because it is a non-color. So, I'm not saying you got to go with gray, but I will say go with something solid and look for something that's already going to work with other items in your wardrobe. An easy way to determine this is find something just compliment your shirts or matches a color in the jacket. It doesn't really matter if you wear a sweater and a jacket they're about the same color, the difference in the texture is going to allow people to easily see there's a difference. Next up, let's talk about casual jackets. And in case you're wondering the difference between a jacket and a coat, a jacket is something that actually can have a layer on top of it. Jackets do not allow for another layer on top and jackets are normally shorter. You're not going to see jackets go past the curvature of the buttocks and many jackets go right and end right at the waist. Now, different types of casual jackets out there. You saw throughout this video I was wearing a leather jacket. I could have easily substituted that for a suede jacket. Both options I've made videos in Nazima bout and I love them. I have plenty in my wardrobe. Now, the field jacket, this one is really underutilized and what I love about it is often times they come in a very lightweight material. So, right here as you can see I've put that layer over the sweater and because of the length of the jackets, the pockets right here it's going to give a bit more depth. It definitely, you know, again, really relatively monochromatic look here, but this green is one of my favorite colors. So always bring in solids as well with most jackets, your first couple jackets, then maybe your third or fourth you can bring in a pattern. Patterns are great for sports jackets and sports jackets are casual. Now, some guys think sports jackets are suits. They're not. A suit is a jacket and trousers made from the same material usually in a dark color that's solid. Now, sports jackets as a name implies come in a wide variety of different materials, different colors because they were intended to be sportier, more fun. In fact, the first sports jackets were worn to be hunting. So, these are often times worn for more durable materials such as tweed and I would say if you can bring in the sport jacket to your wardrobe, this is like the secret weapon to really level up your fall and winter and even spring wardrobe. But, I get it, that's too dressy for you. Then again, look to the trucker jacket, the jean jacket. These are great options here and actually they come in a wide variety of colors and more materials than just denim. And, if you want to bring in something more classic, maybe look at the Blouson jacket, the Harrington jacket. You know, maybe go for a style like a bomber or a flight jacket that isn't even made from leather. There's a wide variety of different materials. This right here is just a great option. You can even bring in a varsity jacket. Next up, we've got coats. Now, when it comes to coats, function first. But if you've got that coverage, you can start to have fun. And I do think if you live in an area like I do here in Wisconsin, if you're over in Minneapolis, guys, you should have a few at least a few coats in your wardrobe to be able to change it up and have fun. Have a parka because it gets deathly cold when it's, you know, negative 30. That being said, when it's just 30 degrees, maybe have a little bit of fun. Look for one of those top coats that you can wear over your suit and has a great look to it. Maybe when it gets down to zero, you're in Chicago, hey, you still want to be able to pull off your dad was in the Navy, you want to pull off a P-coat. They have a long storied history and are incredibly versatile and warm. Maybe your English and your great grandfather served in the Great War will bring in the duffel coat. There are some great historic photos and this jacket can still be found and is incredibly functional and warm and looks good. Now, for you guys out in California, I get it. You're not getting crazy winters, but you got also some options, maybe the trench coat. Yes, has a classic military history, but also featured in the movie Cosmolanka and a wide range of other movies. Yeah, most people aren't even thinking to pull off a trench coat, but, yeah, it is functional and you can't even bring in maybe a waxed jacket you're up in the Northwest. Hey, I know you get a lot of rain, that is your guys' idea of snow, but wear a jacket that's going to be functional, has classic maybe a classic barber. Now, a lot of those coats and jackets can cost a pretty penny. So I would go with simple solids that you can add flavor. Remember we talked about color early on? Well, this is where you have fun with accessories. So, scarves, gloves. Guys, you see some gloves out there with a bit of color? They can really add a pop to the whole look and you can keep that coat relatively simple. Bringing a scarf with a variety of colors have a few options right here. It totally changes up the look when you wear the scarf especially if you know how to tie that scarf not right. All right, gents, so let's talk headwear. You got tons of options I know during the summer, but you got just as many during the winter. Yeah, you know they wear the beanie, the same beanie they've been wearing for years. How about upgrade that? Go with something with a little bit thicker, heavier of a stitch, made from a better material. You've got that cotton one, bring in something that's made from a wool or maybe even a cash mirror wool blend. Yes, it's a little bit pricier, but it looks so much better. How about even level up that? Let's go for a newsboy. Let's go for a flat cap. You can find these insulated and they do a really great job of not only keeping the head warm, keeping the snow off your head, but they're just stylish. They look good. I'm not saying you got to go all trilby or fedori. You don't have to bring in anything like that or Ushanka, although, you know, if you've got a Russian or Ukrainian heritage, go for it. But I do think this is just simply an easy way for a guy to be more stylish is to bring in a nice insulated hat. Now, if you're in the Midwest, maybe, you know, up in Michigan, you could bring in that Stormy Cromber. I think it's originally from that area, isn't it? And now, let's get into trousers. So the base layer of the trousers. If you live in an area of the world that it gets below zero, consider thermal underwear. Now, there's a lot of cheap options out there. I do recommend spending a little bit more especially when it comes to the bottoms. You want something that's insulated that just fits well, is comfortable, doesn't have any hot spots, and this can make a huge difference especially if you're not buying specialty heavier weight winter pants. That being said, a heavier weight jean is a decent start. And for a lot of guys, this is a lot more stylish especially in a raw denim. There are specialty materials like Cavalry Twill, Moleskin. You can find a wide variety if you look for flannels. I know sometimes I just walk into a specialty menswear stores and this would be in the mall when I'm traveling. I'd say, do you have any flannels? And they've usually got a few pairs. Sometimes in different styles, shape, you know, just basically they look like jeans except they're made from a napped material. This basically has a little bit of a three-dimensional weave to it. So it's going to better insulate because it's going to trap just a little bit of air and they are really comfortable. And I really just like how, yeah, they change up the whole, they fit like jeans, but they look better. Now, of course, you can always get gray flannels in a dress pant if you look for them. Again, going into finer menswear stores or just looking online, there are some options out there. You're also going to see Moleskin. This is going to usually be made from cotton and it has, again, a little bit of a napped surface. And let's not forget Corduroy. I know a lot of you guys remember this maybe as a kid. You had a pair, nothing wrong with bringing them back. You're going to see different amounts of whales, seven whales or eleven whales. That's actually the number of ribs per inch and I would go with the eleven. And, of course, we can't forget the foundation of a man's wardrobe, his shoes. So, when it comes to dressing up especially during the colder months whenever the ground is a little bit more slick, you want to make sure especially on your shoes, your dress shoes that you've got a bit of traction. So, look for rubber soles or a mixture of leather with rubber right there on the front. I also like to go with shoes with a good year weld. These are going to be more water resistant and basically that's the stitching where the bottom and the top have a can basically be resold. Now, if you're going to stick with sneakers, avoid the solid whites and avoid anything made from a canvas material especially when there's going to be rain, there's going to be slush, there's going to be snow on the ground. You want something that can get a little bit dirty and is easier to clean up. That's why I like leather and I like leather sneakers in a darker color. But my favorite footwear during the cold months boots especially boots that can deal with the elements that easily slip on and off work with my wardrobe. And, guys, if you want to see the ultimate video on how to find the perfect pair of boots, I go over ten different styles, how to find the right style for you and buy it and get a great deal. Guys, I've got you covered in this video right here. I just made it a while back. It is a solid video, so go check it out. A really good one if, again, you are in the market for boots. Yeah, check out this video. Boom! Right here."

        "transcript": " Did you know 93% of men own at least one pair of jeans? And if you're in that 93%, you're about to learn everything you need to know because with the right styling, jeans aren't just casual, they're iconic. From the best shoes to pair with your denim to layering like a pro, this is your ultimate guide to jean styling. Let's start off with how to style your jeans with boots. So, I'm going to assume that most of the jeans we're talking about here are dark denim. Now, of course, you got tons of options. You could go with black denim, you could go with a red denim, you could go with a gray denim which is actually underused and can look really good point being you got tons of options when it comes to colors. I'm going to go with the most classic, just that classic dark denim that I think every man should have in his wardrobe and for Chelsea. So, you could go with black, there's a wide variety of different Chelsea boots out there. But the type and the style of jeans I'm going to look at are going to be either a slim or a tapered cut. You could also go with a straight cut. What you want to avoid, though, is going to be a loose baggy cut or even a boot cut. Yes, these are boots, but most boot cuts are made for western boots or boots that are going to have a larger thicker shaft at the top. Chelsea boots fit a little bit closer and depending on the style of the Chelsea boot, it could be a dress Chelsea boot. Now, this one because of the sole, I know it's going to be a little bit more casual. So, possibly I could get away with a pair of boot cut jeans, but, again, you want to try them on in general, though, straight cut I think is going to work for the majority of men trying to look good in a pair of Chelsea's or you could go for a tapered cut if it's a little bit more of an elegant Chelsea. Next up, we've got the Chaka very similar to the Chelsea in design, but notice we've got the lacing and it is going to be more casual. Now, the jeans style, so you're going to work with Chaka very similar to the Chelsea. You can go with that slim tapered cut, but, again, it's going to be the straight cut. You want to have a little bit more of an opening at the bottom. That being said, most boot cuts are probably going to be too wide especially if it's a modern boot cut. It's coming in this looser clothing that we're seeing is trending right now. If you go with a classic boot cut, one that maybe came out about five to ten years ago, again, you can go and measure the openings. You can try this out. And that's what I recommend. Most of these brands selling jeans, they've got their own models that they use and their measurements. One could have a boot cut with an opening of 14 inches at the bottom almost bell bottoms, you know, 15 inches. Other ones are going to have more like 12 to 13 inches which could work for a pair of Chaka's like this. So, now, let's talk about boots that actually work with the boot cut. Both of these right here are going to be heavier, are going to be more casual. And because of the length of the shaft, not necessarily the thickness, all both of these right here would work fine with a boot cut. Maybe not too wide because it could start to envelop the whole boots, but in general because of the size, because of the clunkiness, the build of these boots right here, they're not going to be dwarfed by that opening at the bottom. You could also wear straight and I think straight jeans for the majority of boots is pretty much the perfect one to go with. I would be careful about going with a tapered fit. Definitely, you don't want to go skinny unless maybe you're going for that clunky foot. Yeah, if you're a fashionista, then what are you doing watching my video? Should you be teaching this stuff? No, not for me, not my style, but I think this right here either one of these you could wear a boot cut and be fine. And as many of you guys could probably guess, a boot cut is going to work perfect for Western boots. And this is originally what the boot cut was designed for. So, in brands like Wrangler and other Western styles, we see a lot of boot cuts because cowboys need to be able to put their boots on and be able to cover the shaft. Now, you're going to see some people out there wearing the jeans in the shaft. I'm not going to recommend it for the majority of men. Now, if you've got a pair of handmade boots and you really want to show off the handwork, then I guess go for it. Now, that last style was a Western boot. This is a roper. You're going to notice the ropers have a shorter shaft and usually not as wide of a shaft not as pronounced. And this is going to be, again, perfect for the boot cut. The straight cut is going to work great. Slim or skinny jeans, yeah, you want to avoid. Now, what about baggy jeans? For most men, I'm not going to recommend that style. I know it's coming back. If I would have to choose a pair of boots to go with, it would be something that's heavier, a little bit more clunky. You could go with a hiking boot, kind of an explorer boot. You could also look at moccasin style boots. I love them because they're incredibly comfortable, but that larger toe box with the overall, you know, features, the contrast in, you know, the design and everything right here makes the boots look a little bit bigger than they actually are. So, if you wanted to go for something that would balance out that looser fit, then these would probably be it. If you go with a relaxed cut which is fine, especially for a lot of guys that just like a looser jean and a relaxed cut is not the same as baggy and it's usually going to have a little bit larger of an opening. So, a relaxed cut jean would work with either one of these. Straight cut, as always, will work with these right here. Boot cut would work as well. Skinny or, you know, tapered jeans, you'd want to be careful. You could possibly pull it off with the right style of taper or if you went one size larger. Next up, we've got the dress boot. Now, the name implies this is going to be one of the dressier styles of boots out there. This pair right here, it has a bit of a brogue design, a brogue as many of you guys know. Holes cut into the leather this comes out of. I believe it was the UK, maybe it was Scotland or one of those northern areas that's always starting fights up there. They said, hey, we're going to walk through these marshes and we want the water to be able to leave our shoes. So, that's where the brogues originated from. These are not going to go all the way through. It's more of a decorative design, but it is considered something really nice. It makes it a little bit more difficult to clean. In either case, we've got one from Suede, we've got one more in a polished leather right here. Either one of these straight jeans, of course, would work, but maybe you could find a pair of tapered. You don't want to go for a tight tapered. You want to go for something that fits maybe a little bit looser. Again, go with that dark colored denim, black denim right here mixed in with that brown. If anyone thinks that brown doesn't go with black, just look at the soles right there. Look at how they're black. So, you can clearly see that black does go with brown. It's a really smart combination especially when you want to dress it up maybe with a sports jacket or maybe a really nice sweater during the winter. Skinny, I would avoid that type and you could go maybe with a relaxed fit on these boot cuts. I think it would be too much for the beautiful, I think, more delicate nature of these boots, but, yeah, you could go with a pair of relaxed jeans. Definitely not, yeah, don't go with baggy. Now, what about the humble work boots? So, first up, don't be confused by the name. A work boot maybe 40, 50 years ago was primarily used for work. Nowadays, we see where you can dress them up, you can dress them down. You can wear them, of course, to work, but you could also wear them every single day as you're just exploring New York City. That's what I like about this style is it's incredibly versatile and it works with a wide variety of jeans. I mean, this pair right here, I could wear with a pair of slim cuts, I could wear it with a straight cut, a loose fit jean. Heck, I'd even stretch it and say you could try to wear this with baggy jeans. I probably wouldn't be able to pull it off, but who knows, maybe you could. I think the key here is finding the right style because this one right here a little bit more elegant, a little bit, you know, sharper looking, a little bit more delicate looking if you want to use that word. This one right here, just heavier clunkier. Why? Look at the sole. So, if you want to, you know, a pair of boots like this and you want to wear them with a bigger jean that has more, you know, excess fabric on it, then look for a larger sole. So, next up, let's talk about sneakers. The problem with this is that many of the sneakers, they actually fit in multiple categories, but I'm going to try to break this up so you can easily understand. Canvas sneakers. This is where sneakers really got their start. In the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, we saw the rubber sole with a canvas upper. In fact, if you go back even further, we did see variations, but really that's when it became mass manufactured. Now, there's a couple of things I love about canvas sneakers. In general, they're going to be more lightweight, they're going to be more breathable than any type of leather or dress sneaker out there. They're also usually going to be more affordable. All that being said, believe it or not, leather sneakers actually have a longer history. Now, they didn't pick up as much because leather has always been a luxury material with more expensive de-manufactured. And sneakers, you know, they experimented with different materials. Initially, the first pair of sneakers were made from leather. Now, leather historically has great properties that made it attractive for footwear. One of the big ones is durability. Basically, you can bend leather tens of thousands of times and assuming it hasn't been exposed to moisture or any damaging materials, it's going to always come back to its original form. And besides being durable, it's also naturally resistant to abrasion and other types of damage, whether it be the elements or it be, you know, chemicals or anything else that is going to be there on the ground. Leather also cleans up really well. It can take a shine, it can take dyes, so you can get a bit of a sheen on it which is going to give it a dressier type of look. Now, if you're looking to level up your style, you really need to check out my free community over on school. I've set this community up, so we've got free classes that you can make your way through step by step and learn the basic foundations of men's style. And I have to say the men that are in this group are friggin awesome. We've got to know a whole policy, people treat each other with respect. And what we've managed to create in this community is a place where a man can come in and ask questions and get some solid advice. So, gents, use the link in the description of today's video. Go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. Now, the next category is going to be sports sneakers. And, yes, I know there are canvas and leather sports sneakers, but in general, this category of sneaker include shoes that are made for a specific purpose. This is going to include basketball shoes, this is going to be running shoes, weightlifting shoes, tennis shoes, sprinting shoes, any shoe that is made for a particular sport is going to fall into this category. Now, be straight up, gents. Of course, you can wear a sports shoe with jeans. You can do it again whatever you want, but in general for a lot of people especially when it comes to running shoes, this looks like you're not even trying. Now, basketball shoes especially those that are going to be on popular athletes, those they actually have a very interesting history in how they mix in with fashion. Be careful, again, when you're mixing a sports shoe with jeans, sometimes it just looks like you don't even know what you're doing, you're not trying. Now, this next category is perhaps the youngest and that is the dress sneaker. And I know a lot of people out there especially traditional and that can't even exist. That's an oxymoron. The word sneaker mixed in with dress clothing, it's like oil and water, you know, they can't mix. Well, they sort of do because that's the thing that happens with style over time with fashion is that we start to see things emerge. And what we notice is that men want to be comfortable and a lot of them are getting away from dress shoes. They're going into these sneakers and it's not just, you know, the leather upper and they're going with these non-traditional designs. Some of these leather sneakers, you know, they actually almost look like dress shoes. That being said, if you're dressing for a black tie, you're going to want to keep it traditional. But, if you're wearing a suit and you've got foot problems, you find some of these dress sneakers, hey, they just work, I feel comfortable. Again, you're confident in that look, then go for it. I do think there are other options, but I know why a lot of guys go for this. Now, we're dress sneakers always going to dress up the jeans. Are they going to dress up the outfit? Well, I think if you're going for a jean and sneaker combination that you can wear with a sports jacket, I do think that, yeah, I would be looking at dress sneakers, but don't think that dress sneakers are ever going to be at the level of dress shoes at least probably not for the next 30 or 40 years. Now, what about retro sneakers? So, this is where they take a design that was popular in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, maybe just in the thousands and they bring it back. These are going to be more into the fashion space and I actually do like this. I like seeing something that was a classic design, not slip away, not disappear. An example of this is going to be Air Jordan. You're going to see the Air Jordan ones being very popular, but also the Air Jordan threes, the Air Jordan sixes, and the Air Jordan fours. Now, fashion sneakers are going to be designed specifically for trends. For, you know, they're not going to make sense functionally all the time. They are going to be probably a little bit louder. Sometimes some people would say obnoxious, but if you are a height beast, you're into fashion, you want to show that you're onto the latest trends, more power to you and what are you doing watching this video. But, in this case, if you're going to get into this, you kind of need to know what's moving, what's popular. You know, many of you guys have seen Adidas got into this game and got burned and a few other, yeah, it's a very interesting space. And, of course, I couldn't leave out the category of dad sneakers. Dad sneakers are all about comfort and wearing them with the right type of socks all the way up. But, seriously, you get the right pair of dad sneakers, you are not going back. I actually don't normally wear dad sneakers. I like boots a bit more. But, when it comes down to it, guys, you know, strangely enough, dad's sneakers are making a huge fashion wave right now. Now, really quick, I do want to mention lacing systems. So, traditional lacing is going to be where the majority of you guys are going to want to buy shoes that have this. If you're buying a pair of shoes and they've got Velcro, that's fine. I get it. Some of you guys maybe have arthritis. You know, you want something simple, but I'm just saying that's probably going to be best on a sports or performance shoe. The same thing with quick lace systems, I think that they work, they look good, but they're going to be more for shoes that are going to be more functional in nature sports shoes. Now, I have seen a lot of these slip-on variant sneakers coming about. I think it's really interesting, again, from a convenient standpoint as a guy that travels, I like slip-ons. One of the reasons I don't wear sneakers normally when I'm traveling is I don't want to deal with the lacing. So, I see that as being attractive. However, you want to make sure they're not too casual looking, which right now, the majority of them are. Now, I mentioned colors. So, the basic rule here is that neutral colors, we're talking grays, whites, blacks, and beiges. These compare with pretty much any type of jean. Yes, some are going to have a higher contrast or going to have a lower contrast depending on the type of jean, but I understand that if you get sneakers especially solids in any of these colors or even with a bit of contrast in the sole, they're going to be relatively easy to imagine, you're going to be safe. But, gents, what about those stylish loafers? So, the loafer by definition is going to be a type of dress shoe that does not have lacing on it. Now, the most famous style of loafer we're going to see out there that's been around almost 100 years is going to be the penny loafer. Seriously, it was designed in the 1930s and this loafer in the 1950s and 60s became a classic menswear piece that just dominated. It was casual, it was easy for men to be able to dress up, dress down. It was just a favorite of young college students who continued to wear it into their 40s, 50s, and now 60s. Which actually, if I think about it, I'm sure there are guys in their 90s still wearing penny loafers. The point here is the Lindy effect and that is the longer something has been around, the longer it is going to be around. So, the fact that penny loafers have been around for 100 years, it can pretty much rest assured that they're going to be around for another 100. So, this means that if you're going to be picking up a pair of loafers, there's nothing wrong with actually buying and splurging for a pair of quality loafers. Now, when I look at the design of a pair of penny loafers, it's the simplicity that grabs me. The fact that when you look at this, there's nothing flashy on it. In fact, you go with a solid color. If you're going to be adding this pair of shoes to your wardrobe, look at the shoes that you already wear. If you've got all black dress shoes, then stick with black penny loafers. If you stick with browns, dark browns, medium browns, then go ahead and bring in a similar color. What you're really doing is you're changing out the style and you want something that's already going to mix and match with the existing clothing in your wardrobe so that you can wear it with more than just jeans. Now, speaking of color, it's important to note that black is going to be the most formal of all dress shoe colors. So, if you do really want to go with loafers, they're going to work well with the widest number of jeans. You probably want to go with a lighter colored loafers. In general, I've seen guys be able to pull off black loafers with denim. Highly recommend if you don't own any loafers, this is the one you need to start with. It is so easy to bring into a wardrobe. Especially if you want with a color like oxblood or dark brown is that you could wear them with a casual suit. You could pull these off with jeans in the same day and they're just going to work for you. Next up, let's talk about tassel loafers. And these are very recognizable by that tassel right there on the vamp. Now, these emerged right after World War II out of Europe. They made their way over the United States. These have always been considered to be some of the dressier loafers out there. And we're going to see this with the finish on the shoes. In general, they're not going to be made in very light colors, so we're going to see these darker. These are going to be some of the hardest shoes to wear with denim. It can be done, dark denim, go with maybe a medium brown tassel loafers. But, in general, I would not recommend these as your first loafers. And if you really want something to wear with denim, these are probably one of the loafers that in general to avoid. That being said, I still own a pair and I can wear them with casual suits, but with denim, it's hard. Maybe with denim in a sports jacket, you could pull it off, but, yeah, it is a push. It's a little bit of a stretch. Next up, we've got the Bitlofer, also known as the horse bit. This emerged, I believe, in 1953. Gucci is the company that made this popular. Initially, it was just something worn over in Italy, made its way out of Europe, and soon in the 1980s especially, became a style fashion trend that everyone was jumping on. And now, to this day, it is a classic loafer now made by a wide variety of different manufacturers. It's nice, simple loafer. I've got a pair of Gucci's and what I love about these is, yes, you can wear them with denim. The Bit across just makes them casual, makes them fun, and they come in a wide variety of colors. I will say, though, the big negative with these is that you've got to have a little bit of confidence to be able to pull this off because you've got this shiny thing right there that really serves no functional purpose on the top, vamp part of your shoes. Got to, hey, I know what I'm wearing. I enjoy it. I like the look. Not for everybody. Again, that's why I'm recommending penny loafers for the majority of men. If you're just starting off, wearing loafers, especially wearing with jeans. Next up, we've got Moccasins. And Moccasins come in a wide variety of styles. They have since kind of been hijacked by the dress shoe world. And they're technically not dress shoes, you could imagine. Anyone that's familiar with Native American history knows that the Moccasins come out of the North America's Native population, although there's some argument that different cultures in different parts of the world made similar shoes. Now, it's interesting in a classic Moccasin, you actually don't really have a sole. You just got a leather covering on the bottom they would wear out quickly and they would be resold, rebuilt. The top actually lasting a lot longer. But in modern Moccasins, we do see a sole. We do see a structure there on the base so that they'll last longer, be able to give the wear a bit of grip. And we see them in a variety made by a wide range of different manufacturers, but the key with Moccasins is going to be the overall structure with the stitching going right around the top outside. And with their non-traditional background not coming out of dress shoes, these are going to be one of the most casual slip-ons you can grab out there. You're also going to see driving shoes fit into this category as well. Driving shoes, though, instead of having the leather just at the bottom, they're actually going to have just bits of usually rubber. These aren't shoes actually you'd want to be wearing out. I know I've actually done this and I realize I'm wearing into the shoe. They're actually truly made to be worn when you're out driving and they should give the driver a little bit more feel of the controls and the pedals at the same time be able to give him good grip. All that being said, these are very casual slip-ons. So, these are perfect for denim. If you're looking for, hey, a slip-on, a loafer that is actually 100% pretty much made for denim, it's going to be the moccasin. You could also argue it's made for shorts, but really this is to even wear these with a suit, these would have to be really dressed up moccasins. You don't see them very often and even in that case, I really wouldn't wear them with a casual suit. So, of all the slip-ons we're talking about today, the moccasins are going to be the most casual, probably the best ones to pair solely with denim. Next up, we've got Belgian loafers, not to be confused with tassel loafers because Belgian loafers are going to be much more casual. And we see this in the materials they're often made from. So, when we look at loafers that are made from suede, a variety of different materials, it's going to be Belgian loafers right there at the top. So, what's great about these is that they're pretty versatile. They're going to be a little bit flashier than a lot of the other loafers we talked about. But, if you want something, again, that you could wear with a casual suit, something that you could wear with jeans and really stand out, I've seen like green suede, blue suede. Really interesting, you know, if you like style, Belgian loafers are such a great option. They're very functional and you get a good quality pair incredibly comfortable. Next up, let's talk about kilten loafers, also known as kilties. These apparently have been popular with golfers and people over in Scotland for over 100 years. Kings have worn this particular style, so you know this stuff is good. But, basically, they just got this apron right on the front that gives it a little bit of a kilten look and hence why it gets its name. But, again, these have been around since, you know, made popular since the 1950s, manufactured. But, even before then, these things were popping up and just, again, if you're going to be out playing golf, you want a classic shoe or you just simply like the look and their casuals. So, again, these are perfect for wearing with denim. Next up, let's talk about slipper loafers. Don't confuse these with slippers, which are a whole other type of shoe which I think are fine. More men should have slippers, but slipper loafers, these are actually going to be incredibly formal. Yes, you can wear this stuff with black tie, with white tie. You are required to wear a type of slipper or, you know, a particular type of shoe. Basically, they call these opera pumps. Yes, men wearing pumps. But, the idea here is that these are made from velvet. They're made from very high quality materials, only worn to special occasions, made to be worn with delicate clothing that a gentleman would wear to the show, to meet the king, you know, those kind of events. Yeah, we're going to see them oftentimes with initials. They do have an initial that is going to make it much more casual. But, as you can imagine, it's safe to say that these are probably not ones you want to wear with denim. It can be done, again, if you are a fashionista when you \u2013 what are you doing watching these videos? You can pull this off, but I think for the majority of us mere mortals, we should probably skip this look. And, finally, let's talk about dress shoes. On paper may not look like a good combination, but if put together skillfully, dress shoes and jeans can look amazing. Now, when we use the word dress shoes, dress footwear, we can be referring to a wide range of different types of shoes that can be worn with suits or that can be worn with casual wear. So, let's start this off with black oxfords. These are going to be a closed lacing system shoe in black and these right here should be reserved for suits. They can be worn with black tie. They really should not be worn with jeans. Although, some guys think they can pull it off. In my opinion, it's never done correctly because these shoes are just too formal. Now, you may be saying, well, what about black bauble oxfords that have a cap toe? Maybe have a little bit of broguing. Again, the black, the formality of the color. I think black dress shoes in general, let themselves to not being easily matched with jeans. And remember, there are multiple things that make a shoe formal. It's not only the color. You may think, oh, these shoes are brown. I'm safe here. Not exactly. Let's look at the style right here. We have a hole cut, one of the more formal styles of shoe. So, the style right here along with it being a dark brown, really to me, it lends that this shoe is more towards formal wear not towards casual wear with jeans. And again, we have another example of a shoe whose color makes it seem like it could be worn with jeans, but whose style says another thing. This is again is going to be an oxford with the closed lacing system. This right here is just going to be a more formal. It would work well with a casual suit, but I would be careful wearing this with jeans. And now, let's talk about dress shoes I think would look great with denim. So, starting off, we've got brogues. You know these are brogues because I can see the perforations here in the leather. And it does make the shoe much more casual. And that's what we're looking for, a more casual dress shoe. Now, the darkness here in the color, it is something that's going to lend itself to be more formal, but it is still a dark brown. It's not a black. And so, this right here I think of worn with the right dark colored denim, this could be worn with jeans. Another dress shoe style that's going to work really well with jeans are bluechairs. Bluechairs are open lacing system shoes. They're going to be more casual dress shoes. What are open lacing systems? Okay, so the back part of the shoe, the quarter basically is thrown onto the front part of the shoe, the vamp. And I can see it right here in the design. So, when you're looking at dress shoes, understand that whenever it's an open lacing system like this, it's going to be a more informal dress shoe. These right here, not only because of the design, but also the color, all of this, the cap toe, this makes it a more casual shoe and it's just a great combination, in my opinion, for jeans. Now, what about monk straps? You bet. These can be worn with jeans a wide different variety. You see right here we've got a contrasting leather. This does make the shoe more casual. And overall, the style with the cap toe, contrasting leather, the double monk strap, you're also going to see single monk strap. Either one can be worn with jeans. Now, what if these were in black? Then, I would be hesitant. I do think that you can pull it off especially maybe with black denim, gray denim, but in general, I would lean towards something that has a little bit more color in it. Now, what about the rule on matching your belt with your shoes? Does it still apply when you're wearing jeans and dress shoes? Actually, gents, it's a trick question because guess what? This combination would work if you go into a Fourth of July picnic wearing lightweight jeans, maybe a lightweight white shirt. Guess what? This combination right here is going to be festive. It's going to work. You don't have to exactly match your belt. This is even close to matching the belt. It's more about complimenting the whole outfit. Seriously, the whole matching the belt with the shoes is a foundation rule. This is one when you understand the principle which is you want things to work together that you understand, okay, this isn't an exact match, but I do see reflections. I see darker variations right here in the finishing of these boots that's going to make it just go really well with this belt. Let's move on to upper wear and kick things off with polo shirts. And, fit matters in this combination more than in a lot of other areas because when you're wearing jackets, you're wearing layered clothing, you can cover up maybe some fit issues, especially clothing on the lower levels of the layering. But, when you're just wearing the polo with jeans, it's something that for a lot of us, we really like to make sure we get a great fit on our jeans. We've got particular brands that we go for. You got to do the same thing with your polo. You've got to make sure that this fits your body. And it's not going to work for every body type. Some body types, they just simply look better with a jacket on top. Yeah, I've got a little bit of weight around the midsection. You've got the shape of a pair. In that case, you're going to want to build up the shoulders, you're going to want to layer with a polo, not necessarily wear a polo with jean combination because that's not going to complement your build. That being said, if you're short and stout, if you are tall and skinny, you can still pull off this combination, but you've got to get the right fit. First up, again, you've got to make sure those jeans fit you well. Hem them if necessary. You don't want them too long there, but make sure that polo fits you well. You don't want it looking too tight in the midsection like you're a stuffed sausage. You also don't want it too loose in the shoulders where it looks like it's going down your arms. So, am I recommended you get the polo and possibly jeans adjusted by the tailor? You bet I am. In fact, know the name of your tailor. It takes an average look and can make it amazing, especially, again, you maybe don't have the largest arms, then get the sleeves adjusted so that that polo fits a little bit closer there. The next rule with this combination is don't try to overdo it. Again, sometimes you're going to find polos out there that are using a loud color or drawing attention themselves. If you're going to wear that polo, understand everything else in the outfit should be muted especially the denim. That being said, if you're wearing a colored denim or you're wearing distressed denim, you're really going to try to pull this look off, then this is when you need to keep the polo muted in a simple clean color. And speaking of colors, I want to go a little bit deeper here and talk about monochromatic looks versus complementary color combinations. So, with a monochromatic look, that's when your top and bottom are relatively the same color. What's nice about this is allows the eyes to go up and down. I usually try to go for this look, I know with wearing a navy polo with dark indigo denim. For me as a father of five that just simply wants a practical go-to daily uniform outfit, I find that this combination just works. But, I get it, this can be boring. So, again, if you're going to bring in a brighter color up in the polo, then try to keep the trials, you try to keep those jeans relatively neutral. That being said, you don't have to keep everything in that indigo color, you can definitely bring in a variety of grays, you can bring in a black. I've seen so many different colors of jeans that can work with actually even colored polos. Assuming again it's a more neutral top, maybe you're having a little bit of brighter color, a little bit more of color with the jeans, or maybe you're bringing together pastels. Even lighter color combinations in tans and browns can work. Perhaps the biggest tip I can give you here is go out there and look for inspiration. Look at color combinations you like, go through magazines, go through Pinterest, go over on Instagram, save those onto your desktop, nothing wrong with that, and try to repeat those same combinations. And even if the styles don't exactly match up, it was more of a t-shirt and jean combination, but you just love that color combination, go ahead and try it, experiment in the polo and see what you can do. Now, what about the rules on tucking versus untucking? Now, if you're going to be wearing dress slacks with a polo with a casual suit, I can see tucking it in even if it is a straight hem if it's long enough. But, in general, straight hem shirts like polos are not meant to be tucked in. So, with jeans a more casual combination, I would say in the majority of situations, it's okay to leave the polo shirt untucked. That being said, it needs to be the right length. So, how to know if your shirt's the right length? Okay. So, once you have it on, raise your arms up. If you expose any of your midsection, that polo shirt is a little bit too short. But, after raising your arms, if you still have two inches of material that's covering your trousers, that polo shirt is probably too long. The perfect length of a shirt is when you raise your arms up and it's just at the top of the trousers maybe a half inch to an inch beyond. That being said, if you've got a favorite polo shirt and it's too long, you actually can get this adjusted by a seamstress or a tailor for a nominal amount. In fact, you could do it yourself if you look up at the tour. Let's now talk about choosing the right dress shirt for your denim. In the same way that denim would try to dress it up for the dress shirt, with the dress shirt, we're actually going to try to dress it down. Go for the more casual options. That means, you know, any type of dress shirt that's made for black tie that's going to have, you know, that wingtip type of collar is going to have pleats in the front, it's going to use studs, you would never want to wear this type of dress shirt with denim. Now, I know the terminology can be confusing. Dress shirts versus button-ups versus button-downs. Let me try to quickly explain the difference. Now, I'll get back to calling everything a dress shirt. So, dress shirts are made to be layered. They're made to be an underpiece, a jacket thrown on top. A button down specifically refers to the collar and a button up is going to be any type of shirt that has buttons in the front area. And these are even shirts made from casual materials that are made in darker colors. They're made to be outerwear in this case. And that's where the confusion lies. Is it these shirts they seem very similar? They all have similar colors, turned down colors, and you're going to sometimes see even dress shirts that have button-down colors. But, to understand when this terminology is thrown around in general, button-down and button-ups shirts are going to be on the casual side and dress shirts are going to be more on the formal side. So, getting back to that formal side, what we're looking to do is in general, if you want to wear a shirt that looks really great with denim, you're oftentimes going to lean towards the button-up shirt, button-downs such as Oxford. Oxford's are an excellent option to wear with denim because they are more casual. Dress shirts are often made from a poplin weave. Very light, they're going to be lighter, they're going to be very tight weaves. You're also going to see dress shirts in a variety, you know, this shirt I'm wearing right here is a dress shirt. It has the stripes going up and down. You will see occasionally checks, but usually those are going to be on more button-up shirts and button-down shirts that are more casual. You're also going to see occasionally shirts out there that have floral patterns, maybe even have dots. Again, those are going to be more casual, not really a dress shirt. Dress shirts per definition usually the color would be pure white. Now, light blue, a lot of us will see that as a dress shirt, but it's technically going to be a dressed up a very formal type of button-up shirt. Now, another thing we're going to see with all of our dress shirts is that they are going to be long sleeved. Anything that is short sleeve is technically not a dress shirt. Then, you're going to see polos, you're going to see short sleeve button-up shirts, but those are casual and they are technically not dress shirts. Dress shirts always have a cuff, which, you know, it used to be the cuffs were removable the same with the colors, but these colors now are pretty much permanently attached, but they are made separate and that is a key distinction of a dress shirt and even a button-down. So, if you look at the fabric right here, notice how the patterns are going straight there and then they're going across here. Clearly, this cuff has been made separate. Now, we talked briefly about collars, but the dressier collar is definitely be the point collar. After that, you're going to see the spread collar and if you understand the way a collar is designed, it's really simply the angle has been opened up on a spread collar. I like spread collars and I do think they're more casual simply because it keeps the collar out of the way. That being said, you also are going to see a button-down. Button-down collars are going to be more casual, made popular because of the sport of polo and you saw them on the polo fields. We also see these in Oxford shirts in a variety of casual shirts, but button-down collars are going to be one of the more casual collar styles we see out there. Now, when it comes to colors and patterns, the most formal is going to be a solid white. The most informal perhaps it's going to be, you know, something like this that has a very strong floral, brighter, heavier colors like this, darker, all that is going to be on the casual side. But, going back over to the formal side, after that maybe a light blue, we'll see whites with a stripe similar to what I'm wearing here is going to be dressier, more formal. And then, as we move down, we start to see the colors come in. Now, understand if you go for anything that is a dark color. Technically, it is not a dress shirt. This is made to be worn as a casual button-up shirt or a button-down. And over on that side, I think that this all works great with denim people. Again, call them dress shirts. You go into a store, you'll maybe buy something online, they'll call it a dress shirt. But, if it is of a dark color, this is technically not a dress shirt. That being said, it's something I think looks great with denim in many situations especially, you know, if you've got the classic just dress shirt overall fit and design and it looks good on you, you can even wear this with a sports jacket. And, again, it functions like a dress shirt, but that darker color or going with, you know, a small muted pattern especially maybe a small repeating pattern. The fabric is going to make it a bit more casual and the overall design, though, is going to give the feeling of a dress shirt something that can actually be worn in layers. It's cold outside, so let's talk about sweaters. Now, the pull-over sweaters, we're going to see this the crew neck, the v-neck, and maybe sometime the notch neck. These are going to be ones that you want to layer, ones that you want to wear it with other pieces, but you don't have to. These are going to be some of the more classic styles out there. And here is where you really want to make sure you nail the fit. Because they're made for layering, these are oftentimes going to be made from those lightweight materials. They're usually going to be dressier especially the v-necks made to be worn with a collared shirt. You're also going to see the crew neck worn with a collared shirt, but these are going to be in solid colors made from a lightweight weave. And, again, in general, these are going to be some of the dressiest sweaters you're going to see out there. Now, that doesn't mean that you can't have a dressy sweater that has a lot going on in the front, such as a classic cardigan or maybe even a sweater jacket. Sweater jackets, yes, can be worn in lieu of a sports jacket. They're not going to be as formal as a sports jacket, just a notch down below formality, but I think that they're a really nice look. Now, the turtleneck sweater can be really close in terms of formality. I think that you can pull this off with a casual suit, definitely a sports jacket. But, if it's going to be a heavier, bulkier weave, then probably not something that you want to layer, you more want to wear it by itself. And, in fact, if we look at the history of the turtleneck, you know, Submariners, military would pull this stuff off, it really is a very functional piece. Again, the determining factor of the level of formality has a lot to do with the weave, with the thickness, and with the color and patterns present. Now, with the half zip, the quarter zip, those are going to be more casual. They're still pullovers, but because of the zipper especially is going to be more casual. I know it seems almost counterintuitive. You would think those large buttons would be more casual than a zipper, but they're not. In general, those buttons are going to have more of a history and a heritage to them. So, you will see if you had to choose one, you want something a little bit dresser, definitely go with a sweater with the quarter buttons. Now, what about the sweater vest? Is it actually a sweater? The answer is yes, it is. It is something a little bit tricky. I think it really looks best on a man that is in good shape whose chest is larger than his waist area, but it is going to draw attention to the waist especially if you're wearing it with a contrasting underpiece. But, yeah, the sweater vest, you can still pull it off, you know, in the right situation. Now, with those heavier set sweaters, there's a wide variety of different types. You're going to see Aaron sweaters out there. These have a classic heritage over with Ireland. You're going to see the Fair Isle sweaters. They've got classic patterns, classic colors, just really nice combinations, but these are going to be made with a heavier virgin wool that's very thick and they are made in general to be worn almost as outerwear. And that takes us to sweater patterns, sweater colors. So, stripes going across. You want to be careful here. Again, I talked about bigger guys. You want to avoid this. It's just going to basically any type of horizontal line is going to draw the eyes back and forth and that's not what we're looking for. We want the eyes to go up and down. So, in general, go for solids. That being said, if you're a heavier set guy, one of those thicker weaves I think can look really good on you. It's going to help to kind of camouflage bring it all together. They're also going to be looser in general which is going to work for your body build. So, a heavier weight turtleneck in general is going to look better than a tighter weave turtleneck. That being said, depending on where you carry your weight and where you're at and again, how you wear this combination. I think a well-fitted turtleneck on a bigger guy who's wearing a sports jacket over that, that is a solid combination even with jeans. Now, what about Argyle as a pattern? Again, this is usually going to draw attention to the chest area of the sweater and you've got these diamonds that are interacting. It's a classic pattern and if you like it, go for it. I do think it's a little bit more of a refined older man's type of pattern, but if maybe you've got some family heritage, maybe you just like the style. Again, look at the combination you're putting with. I think even when you're layering this with all different types of jackets, if you feel it brings in a bit of color, then go for it. All right. So, now, some FAQs. Do you ever tuck your sweater into your jeans? And the answer right there is a definitive no. Now, what if the sweater is long? What if it's, you know, going a few inches past your waist area? Well, I find that it's better just tuck it in and fold it up. At the bottom of most sweaters, you should have a bit of elastic, so it's going to be a very easy, you know, turn and tuck. Next up, you may be asking, okay, I understand I can wear jeans with a sweater, but should I? Does the dress code allow this? Well, again, it depends on the dress code. Anytime that you are, you know, need to dress up with a suit, jeans with a sports jacket and sweater is not a suit combination. A suit is a jacket and trousers made from the same material. But, could you wear a sweater with a suit? Yes, you can. Especially functional wise if you needed to layer to be able to keep warm. Again, you want to keep it to a lightweight weave. Isn't going to draw a whole lot of attention. If you want it more formal, if you're going to be going more casual, you can bring in a wide variety of patterns and colors. I think the jean and sweater combination is now a modern classic. Maybe 40 years ago, it wasn't and that's why you'll still see in some text and some books out there people say not a combination you want to avoid. But, I think that it's one of my go-to looks. I live in a cold area and I like to dress somewhat casual in and around my area because nobody wears suits, nobody wears sports jackets. But, for me, sweaters are a nice step up from a hoodie. And that leads to the next question, why would I wear a sweater with jeans over a hoodie and jeans? Well, straight up, it's a step up. It is a more dressier look. I think more elegant look. I'm not saying nothing against the hoodie, but I think that sweaters and jumpers, you know, for you guys over in the UK, they are really underutilized by a lot of guys especially if you understand the different materials they're made from, how you can go with a wide variety of styles. Most guys don't even own a turtleneck. They're not even try a mock turtleneck. If you don't want to go full on turtleneck, I think it's just a great look especially with that jean combination dark denim that fits you well. If you're in decent shape easily wearing a sweater, I've got this one turtleneck that is a heavier weight dark blue classic Submariner sweater. And I love wearing it with dark denim and boots. Really a good combination. Next up, you may be wondering, is there anything special I need to do for the jeans? Do I need to iron them? Do I need to press them? Can I only wear dark denim with a sweater? Well, you definitely don't need to iron or press them. I know some of you cowboys do that with your jeans. You don't have to do it with the dark denim, but I do really like that darker denim because for me, it's a palette. Again, you want to go with a neutral color. Be careful and you can wear red jeans. You can wear a wide variety of colored jeans, you know, distressed jeans with a sweater. It is going to be more fashion forward. And if you're going to be pulling off that look, then what are you watching this video for? You go out there and own it. Now, what to wear over the sweater with jean? That combination, we've talked about the shoes a little bit earlier, but let's talk about sports jackets. I've mentioned this a few times. I think that if it's a really lightweight sweater with dark denim, you can easily dress it up with a sports jacket, maybe even a suit jacket, a blazer jacket. You can bring in maybe choose instead of going with that sweater, you know, pull over sweater, you could go with a sweater jacket, but you can also keep it casual. Let's just say that, hey, this isn't more casual look, you're wearing the boots with it. You can wear a leather jacket, you can wear a denim jacket. Just make sure you're not going with the same colored denim. I don't know, maybe I need to backtrack on that. What do you guys think? Can you wear a denim jacket, sweater, and jeans? Even if they're closer, you pull off the whole Canadian Tuxedo thing, nothing against my Canadian friends. But, let me know in the comments what you guys think of that combination. I think you got to be careful with this, but there, yeah, there are ways to pull it off. But, seriously, when it comes to jackets, so many casual options out there, you can bring in a suede jacket, you can bring in a field jacket, you can bring in what safari jackets, blouson jackets, tons of options if you look. Now, what about wearing a coat over the jean and jacket combination? Well, I think in this case, you really want to look at what type of coat you're trying to pull off. I like this combination when you leverage the sweater as the insulation and you've got a lightweight jacket. I just like the look of that combination, especially something with a different type of texture. The sweaters in general are going to have that really soft texture. So, I think that a coat with more of a sheen or a tougher surface, maybe a gabardine or maybe just a straight-up synthetic material versus if you go P-coats. I love P-coats, but mixed in with that heavyweight sweater, all of a sudden you've got the soft texture with the soft texture. I don't like it as much. I like to have a little bit of contrast. All right. So, now let's talk about the jeans that you want to wear with your jacket. The vast majority of jeans out there are going to be on the casual side. So, if you're going to wear these with a jacket, you really want to go for those jeans that are going to be a bit dressier, not formal, no such thing as formal jeans. But, those that are over there on that dressier side, so these are going to be free from distress, they're in general going to be darker colors. So, when it comes to distress denim, light-colored denim, when it comes to stone washes, classic blue denim, I mean, there are instances that you can pull this off. If you're a rock star, if you've got the confidence, if you own the company, if you love the look, then yeah, go for it. But, for the vast majority of us mere mortals, I would recommend going with a dark denim. Maybe you can go even with black denim and there are options out there, you know, charcoal gray, something really, really dark colored. That is going to work best with sports jackets, with blazers, with suit jackets. I also like it when the denim is a bit heavier in weave. So, if you can find something raw, something in indigo, that really, really looks good. And people can clearly tell that this is denim, but, you know, mixed in with that dark color with, again, maybe a dark sports jacket or a sports jacket with a little bit of pop and color, I think you can pull off this combination. Now, when it comes to the fit, I'm going to go for a tapered cut, I'm going to go for a slim cut and maybe a straight cut. Avoid skinny, avoid really loose denim. And we're starting to see, again, things go towards the looser side. Be careful of that, especially if you're going with a jacket that's a bit more fitted. And this is something I didn't hit on the jackets too much. But, if you've got a well-fitted jacket, you want to go with well-fitted denim. They should match up in about that type of fit. So, if you've got really close fitted denim with a loose jacket, that combination there is just not going to work. It's going to be off. So, make sure that the fit on that jacket, if you like your jacket, it's a little bit looser, it's okay to go with a straight fit pair of denim. So, wearing a suit jacket with jeans, sports jacket with jeans, blazer jacket with jeans, understand that it's like a chain. It falls down to its weakest link. And unfortunately, jeans are never going to be formal, at least probably in my lifetime. But, this is just something that you have to accept the fact that if it calls for a suit, wearing a pair of jeans with a suit jacket is not a suit. A suit is a jacket and trousers made from the same material. And when most people mean it, they're not talking about anything in denim, they're talking about something in a worsted rule. So, the denim is always going to bring down the level of formality. That being said, if it's your event, if it's an event that is casual. And this is really where this look shines. When everyone else is wearing something casual, maybe they're just all wearing button-down shirts, they're wearing a sweater, a long sleeve shirt, or whatever it may be, you walk in with that sports jacket, with that polo shirt, with the denim, with those great looking boots, that is a combination I absolutely love. And it fits so many situations in our dress down world, but understand that it needs to be the right situation. Don't violate the dress code, especially if somebody's trying to put on a party, they're expecting, you know, everyone to wear. Now, if you're down south and it's accepted, and again, this is where is a fine line and you can go in and let me know in the comments below. Do you guys, what are situations you can wear a sports jacket in jeans? I want to hear from you guys. And really quick, let's talk about all the different fabric types that I think you can wear with a dark blue denim. And again, I'm getting specific there about the denim, but here are just tons. I mean, tweeds, you've got it in green, you've got brown, Harris Tweet, if you're familiar, and this is just some of the higher quality you're going to find out there. Sharkskin, this is actually a suit type, but it's got a slight texture to it and it comes in a variety of colors. Seersucker, you're going to see this out there. Houndstooth, beautiful. Flannels, a wide variety of flannels. You will see these sometimes in bold patterns, but oftentimes just in a gray or a dark gray, and I think again, this can be pulled off with denim. Corderoi, this is going to have, you're going to see seven-wail, eleven-wail, but corderoi, very casual, made from cotton, camel hair, bird's eye, window pane. You're even going to see some Modrus jackets out there, and this is a really bright color, very lightweight, great for the summer, herringbone. From a distance, a lot of times, especially if it doesn't have a contrast to it, it's going to look solid, but you get up close, you're going to see the pattern, but you will also see herringbone in a contrasting color, and this definitely has a strong pattern to it. You're going to see linens, you're going to see fresco, flannels, hopsack out there. Hopsack looks solid from a distance, you get up close. It's going to have a very heavy weave to it, very breathable, perfect for the summer. And I also want to point out, if you choose not to wear a shirt with your blazer and jeans and you go shirtless, no, I'm not saying ever do that, but I'm saying you can wear a polo. You can wear sweaters. Sweaters are such a great option, and they really bring down the casualness of the whole look. So, I get it, not everyone wants to wear a collar shirt, sweaters just, but I like the combination, especially if you can go with the collar shirt with a V-neck sweater with a nice, you know, sports jacket, then you've got that nice denim. Layer looks are just absolutely beautiful. Don't you think for this time of the year? Now, at this point, I want to address a mystery that if you've gotten into denim at all, you've probably seen it out then you're wondering what the heck is going on here. What I'm talking about is how and why did the Japanese become the denim kings of the world? Seriously, when you're looking at a high-end denim that cost over a thousand bucks, yes, there are pairs that cost that much and more, you're going to find most of those manufacturers are over in Japan. So, what's the story here? Well, it turns out after World War II when the American GIs were occupying the country, the Japanese fell in love with denim. In the 1970s in the United States, the denim industry was going through some tough times, especially the mills as they were looking to get new machinery that was faster and could produce cheaper fabrics, cheaper denim. Now, the Japanese through luck or maybe foresight swooped right in and bought the old machinery. These shuttle looms had to be repaired, they had to be modernized, but in a short amount of time, the Japanese had taken the American looms and they were producing some of the most beautiful, high-quality denim on the market. In fact, the Japanese town of Kojima has probably become the denim capital of the world when it comes to quality. Now, for the first 20 or 30 years, this was a very niche industry. The world and the majority of people had moved towards fast fashion, but by the 1990s whenever the sneaker and the denim industry started taking off in the United States, those in the know started taking notice of the quality of the fabrics coming out of Japan. And to this day because they've got this unique machinery, they make some of the best fabrics on the market, which by the way, our sponsor, Guston, actually does some limited runs with these fabrics. Now, what about body types? What about build? What is the best denim type for your build? Guys, I got you covered with this video right here, denim and body types. I break it out, so, yeah, go check it out. Solid video. If you're in the denim, you want to find the right pair for you. Yeah, I talk about the different styles, the different fits, everything right here. Come on. Oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " 93% of men wear the same boring outfits every day. You don't have to be one of them. These style hacks are so good, they should be illegal. But, lucky for you, style police don't exist. So, let's break some rules the right way. First hack on the list is throw on a jacket, sports jacket, blazer jacket, suit jacket, but you can also throw on a denim jacket, a fatigue jacket, a leather jacket. Now, the structured jackets are going to do more for your shoulders. Basically, they're going to create a very noticeable shoulder point. And that shoulder point is going to make your shoulders look larger, therefore making you look more masculine. And if you've got some extra weight around the midsection, slim you up a bit. A darker jacket especially is going to build out that silhouette a bit, but also you can zip it right here in the center. You can button it right there in the center and that, again, is going to slim up that midsection. And if you're wearing dark trousers with a dark jacket, again, it creates that silhouette, allows the eyes to go up and down, a more monochromatic type of look. Now, those are reasons for wearing a jacket you may have heard before, but this next one probably not. And that is when you wear a well-fitted jacket especially in the sleeve area and it fits well at the end, it's not overly long and not overly large here. What this does is it makes the hands look larger. Why is this a good thing? Well, this goes back to primates. Primates oftentimes before, you know, they're just not going to fight each other. They're going to look at visual cues to determine who should be at the top. And oftentimes it's not just the size of the primate, but also the size of their hands. This is usually perceived as someone that actually is, you know, more mature, someone that can grip onto, you know, branch or something like that. Point being is we also look at the size of hands and you want your hands to look proportional. You don't need them to look overly large, but you don't want them to be dwarfed. And when you wear a jacket that fits you well, it just makes your hands look larger and better. Trick number two, tuck your shirt in properly. What's the proper way you may say? Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the military tuck. So, step one is to tuck your shirt in your pants like you normally would. Step number two is to take the excess material evenly on both sides and to go ahead and start to tuck it in under itself. Seriously, with step three, you're just taking your thumb and you're moving that material and folding it over on itself. And there you go. Look at that perfection. Another option is the underwear tuck. Now, this trick helps if you're wearing an undershirt. You see, your undershirt is tucked into your underwear. Your dress shirt is then tucked between your underwear and your trousers. Oh, and don't forget about the gig line. This is where your shirt placket, belt buckle, and trousers seam are aligned. Now, this next hack can save you a lot of money and that is you're going to learn how to stretch your dress shoes. We're talking shoes made from leather here because leather is pliable. Leather is something that can stretch and adjust, but sometimes it feels like it gets a little bit smaller. Maybe you've got a hot spot. Well, guess what? Put the shoes on and then use a hairdryer or more preferred a heat gun. Now, with a heat gun, make sure to keep it from a distance because that can get hot really quick and you don't want to damage the shoes, but that right there can very quickly help the leather stretch. That being said, if you want to do it overnight, one tip I've heard and this is really good if you want to increase the size of the shoes by half a size is to put a water bag, basically take a couple of ziplocks, put water in them, and then make sure they fill up the toe area of the shoe. Then, put them in the freezer overnight and they will expand out and stretch. Now, you may have to do this a couple of times, but you can increase the width of the shoe and the length just a bit. And what are we talking here? It can mean the difference between shoes that are incredibly uncomfortable and shoes that fit perfectly. The next clothing trick that most guys don't know is to only dry clean your clothing when it's dirty. I know this one seems obvious, but here's the thing. A lot of guys don't wear their suits very often, they wear it once and then they send it off to the cleaners. The problem with that is dry cleaning is very rough on your clothing. Think of it like video games, you've only got so many lives with your clothing before it's gone. So, with the suit, sports jacket, blazer, even your nice sweaters, you only need to dry clean them when they're dirty, which for me is about every 15 to 20 wears or once a season. Another quick tip, gentlemen, always dry clean wool clothing before you store it. If you do that and put them immediately into an airtight container, you're not going to have to worry about moth damage. The next trick to level up your style, don't be afraid of bling. Necklaces, rings, but one of my favorite pieces of jewelry that any guy can pull off and most men feel comfortable wearing is a watch. Now, when it comes to watches, they always actually read the study about which watches get the most compliments. Funny enough, the larger watches, watches that just simply grab attention. It makes sense though because it has to be noticed. Now, I'm not saying to wear an oversized watch, but what I am saying, wear maybe a little bit larger than what you're used to try something different. I know for me, I've got smaller wrists, so I like to gravitate towards one, you know, it's about a 43, 44 is the largest. But, hey, maybe if you've got a larger wrist, you try something that's a 50. Yes, guys can pull this off and a larger watch is going to get compliments. It's going to grab attention. That being said, if you don't want to go oversized, then look to bring in color with your watch. This is another way for it to stand apart for it to grab attention and get your compliments. Now, if you're looking to level up your style, you really need to check out my free community over on school. I've set this community up, so we've got free classes that you can make your way through step by step and learn the basic foundations of men's style. And I have to say the men that are in this group are friggin awesome. We've got to know a whole policy, people treat each other with respect. And what we've managed to create in this community is a place where a man can come in and ask questions and get some solid advice. So, gents, use the link in the description of today's video. Go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. Now, before I get into this next hack, let me ask, have you ever seen anyone wearing a pair of jeans that are too long for them? They probably wear these now for a couple months and what happens? All of a sudden, they have loose fabric that is just hanging behind them when they're walking. It looks horrible. So, then, let me ask, do you have a pair of jeans? Do you have a pair of trousers which are just a bit too long in the legs? If that's the case, you can actually fix these in a matter of seconds using hemming tape. The way iron-on hemming tape works is you fold the trousers in on the cells at the bottom with that hemming tape right there between the material. You then use heat and it fuses it together for a perfect hold. Now, if you want to get the original look with the stitching or you want to reinforce it, yes, you are going to need to use a sewing machine. But, in a pinch, if you just want to use the iron-on hemming tape, boom, you can get the job done and it's going to look better than trousers that are too long. The key with identifying quality whether it's a shirt, whether it's a jacket, is look at the materials that were actually used and the way that they put them together. You want to make sure and look at those small details because if they paid attention to the small details, then you can rest assured that the fabric is going to be of good quality, that the thread that they used to actually sew it together isn't going to fall apart on you after five to six washes. So, one of the first things I look at when it comes to a shirt is the buttons. I want to not only look at the type of buttons that were used and plastic is fine, it's going to be the most common, but mother or pearl would be great. But, then, I go look at the stitching. The stitching is key because if they didn't take the time to have a nice tight stitch, if it looks like it's already coming out and the shirt is you never even washed it or even bought it yet, then be very careful about the stitching. Then, look on the inside of the shirt. Are there loose threads all over the place? If there are loose threads, be very careful because they didn't pay attention to the small details. You want to look at the collar. Do you have removable shirt stays? Not all shirts are going to have this, but it's really a nice detail if they've got removable shirt stays. These small details to me signal this is a good quality shirt. The next trick to upgrade your style, go classic with your shades. When it comes to sunglass styles, they're going to suit most men. There are only three styles that you need to know. First up, we've got the classic aviator style. Normally, seen with a metal frame, it's going to be the teardrop design of the lens that separates this from the other styles. Now, when it comes to lenses, tons of options here. I'm going to say keep it simple, go with something that's not going to draw too much attention especially if it's your first pair, go with maybe a darker color in black. And, if that's not exciting enough for you, check out the Hollywood favorite Wayfarers. Tom Cruise, the Blues Brothers. This has popped up in movie after movie and it does take a little bit more courage to pull these off. And, if you're used to wearing aviators, I would seriously give these a shot. And, just like aviators, you're going to see a wide range of different materials. I like keeping it simple, going with black, but tortoise shell is another great option. And, if those frames are too strong, you want something that's in between, check out Club Masters. It's a classic design, a nice hybrid, doesn't have as thick heavy frames as the Wayfarers at the same time a very distinctive look. And, really quick, in case you forgot, a refresher of why this elevates your look creates a bit of mystery. People can't see your eyes, they wonder what's going on behind there. Who's this movie star, you know, that just walked in? Also, it creates cemetery. So, it creates balance in the face. And, last but not the least, choose the right type of pockets for your pants. So, if you ever had a pair of chinos or dress pants, they have the flaring pocket issue. You know what I'm talking about. Looks like you got ears down there, these flaring pockets just making your hips look wider. Now, if this is happening to you, it's most likely because the pants don't fit you, you're wearing them maybe too close to the hips or it could be the style of the pockets. So, we commonly see three types of pocket styles on trousers. First up, we see the vertical pocket style often seen on dress pants. Now, this one is the most common offender when it comes to flair. Why? Because if the trousers don't fit you correctly, this right here is going to fold out, it just looks bad. How to fix the flare with this pocket style? Two options. Take the trousers to a tailor, get them adjusted to fit you better, that may fix the problem. Another option, this one's a bit more extreme, actually so shut the pockets, you're not going to have the flare issue, but you're also not going to have use of the pockets. Now, the next two styles are front pockets are the ones that you want to look for. You want to look for a slanted pocket, you're going to see this on some dress slacks. This is what you want to go for, much less likely to flare out. And, this other type, the western pocket also known as the horizontal pocket, we see it commonly on jeans and chinos. This one will not flare out at all and is my preferred pocket. So, what video to watch next? How about how to fly without getting into a fight? Seriously, guys, travel etiquette that every man needs to go. So, go check out this video or maybe share it with that guy that's sitting behind you and is kicking the seat. Yes, you know what I'm talking about? Actually, in this video, I talk about a story, a fight that I almost saw happen the other day. So, yeah, it's a good one. Go check it out and enjoy."

        "transcript": " One of the biggest mistakes when it comes to old money style is that most guys don't realize how simple it's meant to be. They think piling on layers and flashy details will capture that old money feel. But the truth is, it's all about choosing the right fabric, the perfect drape, and timeless pieces that speak for themselves. Now, let's take a look at a few classic outfits for every occasion. So, starting this off, we got a casual business meeting. Now, you can wear what I'm wearing right here, go with that Maverick blazer with a white shirt. I honestly believe that contrast creates a little bit more of a formal look. And again, the pocket square I didn't even have to think of. Now, keep the trousers simple, you can go gray or even with a pair of chinos. For the shoes, I go with the simple pair of loafers and for the watch, I go with the simple dress watch. For my fragrance, I keep it simple, maybe go with a mix of lavender and vera. Now, what if I'm given a big presentation? I need to dress it up. In this case, let's go with the classic suit. So, if you're a man over the age of 25, I recommend navy blue. If you're under the age of 25, go with charcoal gray. It's going to make it look a little bit older. In any case, we're going with a crisp white dress shirt with that dark red maybe maroon silk power tie. My dress shoes, I'm going to keep them simple, either go with a dark brown or a black Oxford. Definitely, I'm going to recommend a simple dress watch with a leather band that matches the color of my shoes and belt. And my fragrance here, I'm going to keep it subtle. I'm going to go with something that's got a nice simple wood undertone. Next up, we've got summer casual. For this outfit, I see you wearing a short sleeve white polo shirt matched with light gray slim fit linen trousers, white leather sneakers. Your hair on point, wearing a pair of shades, maybe wave fairs or aviators. For a watch, maybe a stainless steel chronograph and top it all off with a clean, crisp, citrus fragrance. Next up, I'm in Chicago for the weekend, going out with friends on a Saturday night. What am I going to wear? First up, a simple, clean, true blue button down. Now, if worn by itself, it may have looked like a dress shirt, but I'm going to match this with a casual olive jacket that's thin. Definitely going for something a little bit more casual. And pair that with a straight fit dark denim and then laced up boots in a dark brown that aren't too dressy yet aren't too casual. That's right, for going out with friends for dinner and maybe something afterwards. Now, the watch here, I'm going to have a little bit of fun, maybe go for a gold undertone or maybe even a rose gold. And for the fragrance, something that's going to catch a little bit of attention, something spicy with a little bit of pepper, maybe an oriental. Next up, we got date night. So again, we're going to start with a casual button down, but this time we're going to go with something with a small repeating pattern. Now, I'm going to pair that with dark colored tailored trousers. And for my shoes, keeping it dark, I'm going to go with a black pair of Chelsea boots. Now, with this clean monochromatic outfit, the jacket is where I'm going to have fun. So, I got a variety of different colored suede jackets I could bring in or if I wanted to create a softer look, I could go with a cardigan whose texture is going to ensure my wife won't be able to keep her hands off me. So, what exactly does it mean to dress like old money? So, when you dress old money, typically this means adopting a style that exudes a sense of timeless elegance, sophistication, and wealth. Building an old money wardrobe, in my opinion, is smart because you're building a wardrobe that isn't going to go out of style. So, I'm going to talk about particular items that you're going to want to pick up to add to your wardrobe to give it that old money feel. First up, the suit, but not just any suit. You don't want to walk into a box store and buy something that is cheap made from a couple hundred bucks. And the issue being is these type of suits, your cheap ones are going to be glued right here in the chest piece. They're also going to have maybe not they're going to have over structured shoulders. They are just going to look, they just don't look great especially when you're sitting back when you're relaxed. And that's why I highly recommend you look at, you know, suits in maybe the $500 plus range. What I like about them is that they've got, you know, a piece right in here. Basically, they're structured with horse hair and it moves with you. And this is key that they're structured in a way that there's a bit of movement because you want something when you put it on, it's incredibly comfortable. Now, do you want to go fully unstructured in the shoulders? You don't need to, but I do like it, you know, personally. Again, try on a variety of different styles. Again, go to the best menswear store in your area and feel the jackets, feel the shoulders. A lot of them actually they overstuffed the shoulders and they don't pack the cotton correctly. This one right here, it pretty much doesn't have anything. It's just a little bit of structure here and I know that that for me is what's a signal of a better quality made suit. But another thing with the suits is the color. So, in general, charcoal, navy and medium gray, those are going to be the first three that you want to start with. If you've already got those or you know, hey, Antonio, I feel pretty comfortable. I want to bring in maybe just a little bit of pattern. You can bring in a subtle pattern. I always like herringbone. Point being, if you get the right suit, you go with a classic notch lapel. You've got the shoulders right on this. You're not doing anything crazy on this. Everything here is classic in design. This is a suit that could last you 20 years if you take care of it. And if you're looking at materials, you're wondering, okay, what is this super 120 versus a 110 versus a 150 versus a 180? Know that pretty much anything over 100 is going to be fine. You'll see some super 80s out there, maybe in vintage shops and that may be a little bit too rough. Usually, the higher the number, the tighter the weave and the softer the material is going to be, which isn't always a great thing. You don't want something with too much sheen or too much shine to it. A super 120, a super 140 in worsted wool, which is basically just a tightly woven wool, is in general what I look for. Now, depending on the number of suits you have, let's say it's three, you want to have at least two to three times as many dress shirts. It really depends on how often you're wearing these items. But if it's pretty much every day, let's say you're working a white collar job or you're just simply, hey, I wear suits quite a bit, I think you should have three shirts for every suit. And you want to make sure that these are three shirts that work. And the easiest way to do this is to stick with a classic white. It's pretty much going to work with any suit color, even a white suit, which I'm not going to recommend as one of your first ten. But light blue is another great color combination and you can change up the styles of the collar. You can go, you know, right here I've got a classic button down, which is going to be very casual. We'll talk about that in a second. It could also bring in stripe patterns on the shirts. I think that a very thin blue stripe on a white background is a very classic look and is a great, you know, actually pretty versatile. You can wear this with a wide variety of different suit combinations. That being said, if you want to bring in other shirt colors, look to pastel. You're going to see pinks, you're going to see lavenders, you're going to see mint greens. I think that these are not as versatile as the aforementioned colors. That being said, I know a lot of guys like it and if it works with your color tone, let's say you've got really dark skin or really light skin and, again, you hold those colors up to your skin and you really just like the way they work, then go for it. Now, what about dark color dress shirts? Well, technically they don't exist. It's only going to be in the lighter colors that we see dress shirts, but I know that they do exist, but they are more casual button downs than they are dress shirts. If you really like the combination, you're going for a monochromatic look, that's great. It could be your style, but it's not going to be an old money look. Now, I talked about I'm wearing a button down collar. There's a wide variety of shirt collars out through the two most common are going to be the spread collar and by far the most common is the point collar. Point collars are actually made to be worn with a necktie. That's when they look most complete. So, if you're going to be, you know, not really wearing a necktie, I would recommend going with a spread collar or a button down collar. Now, the button down collar, this came out of the polo field, it's been around for over a hundred years. The company Brooks Brothers are the ones that made this popular. I think it looks great on a classic Oxford shirt. Now, the Oxford shirt gets its name from Oxford fabric. And in case you're not familiar with fabric terminology, Oxford fabrics are a basic basket weave. The Oxford fabric unique is that they sometimes mix in multiple colors. They don't have to, you can go all white, but sometimes you see with that white, they'll mix in a bit of blue, they'll mix in a bit of red and this gives a two-tone appearance. On top of that, depending on the fineness of the yarn and the tightness of the weave, we can get various types of Oxford fabric from plain Oxford to pinpoint Oxford to the most expensive and formal and hardest to weave royal Oxford. Now, at this point, you may be wondering, Antonio, why do these details matter and why is this an old money essential? Well, the answer is because nowadays, people don't associate the shirt necessarily with the fabric, they associate it with a particular style. That is the button-down collar. Next up, let's talk about the polo shirt. I'm not talking about those cheap ones that you can find for 10, 15, 20 bucks. I'm talking about higher-end polos. The beautiful thing about the polo, especially for an old money wardrobe, is how it can work with a number of the trousers. You can dress down a suit by wearing it with, you know, a polo. You can actually dress up just a regular pair of trousers or shorts by pairing them with the polo. You're also going to see the polos are going to start to bend and, you know, I talked about going with a lot of neutral colors. And, yes, you're going to see tons of white polos, dark navy polos in the colors, you know, very similar to the suits. But you're also going to see polos in a variety of brighter colors of colors that, you know, just simply pop a bit more. And this is where I think in an old money wardrobe, you can really have fun with color and still find ways to mix and match it with the other items in your wardrobe. The polo line is going to be for the younger generation. Now, what you need to be careful of with the polo line are these huge logos. A bit of wealth, a bit of money sure makes it a lot easier to be able to pick up the items that we're talking about in today's video. And, of course, if a man doesn't have direction, if he doesn't have a reason, if he doesn't have purpose, well, if he doesn't have those things, it doesn't matter how well-dressed a man is, he's just an empty suit float namelessly. Well, gents, here's the deal. If you're a man in your 30s, 40s, or 50s, look at the level yourself up to find a community of like-minded warriors out there trying to improve their health, wealth, and purpose. Well, gents, if that's you, you need to check out our new community, HWP. Over at HWP, we've got a step-by-step program to help men become their best selves. I've developed this program over the last decade, leveraging my experience as a former officer of Marines, business owner, and father. The reality is when you're 35, 45, 55, it's very difficult to find like-minded men looking to improve themselves. At HWP, we've got a supportive community and we embrace the idea that daily through small actions, if you just get better by 1%, over the period of months, you're going to see compound improvements and take measurable steps towards becoming the man you know yourself to be. Gents, if this all sounds interesting, down in the description of today's video, go check us out. I'm putting a link over to Health Wealth Purpose. Or you can just type it in your search bar, healthwealthpurpose.com. And, yeah, you can learn more and see if this program is right for you. The next old money essential on this list is another clothing item whose cloth gave the item its actual name and that is chinos. So, chinocloth by definition is a twill fabric made from 100% cotton. Now, as it we seem to be talking about, weaves a basket weave, simple twill weave, a little bit more complex and more dense and more durable. Not great for shirts necessarily, but amazing for jackets and especially trousers that you want to be able to stand up to a beating. Now, chinos come in a wide variety of colors and I do think that in a classic wardrobe, you can bring them all in, but the one that you're going to want to start with is the classic khaki. And khaki actually is a shade of brown and that's why, you know, this chino and sometimes you'll hear the name synonymous chinos khakis, but understand, chino, it's more about the twill weave and the pant style versus khaki is actually going to be a specific color. Now, we talked about suits, but what about the blazer? What about the sports jackets? So, both of those I think should be in an old money wardrobe. And the question is, are you going to find reasons and times to wear it? I think the answer should be yes. For me, sports jackets are where it's at actually this is part of a suit, but I am wearing it separate almost like a sports jacket. If you watch any of my videos, the majority of the time I'm wearing sports jackets. Now, why go with the blazer? I've really fallen out of fashion for a lot of people, but they are still in an old money wardrobe because there are so many options especially when it comes to the materials. So you're going to see surge out there, you're going to see jersey, you're going to see a lot of lightweight materials that are very breathable. In these blazers, the majority of them are going to be of a navy color or a dark blue. You're going to occasionally see a regatta blazer out there that's not part of an old money wardrobe, so skip on that. But what I like about navy again, this palette right here and not using just a suit jacket is that you've got a separate jacket that's made to be worn with a variety of other trousers, other colors right there, a combination with the navy I think is a really nice combination. Now, the waxed jacket is a type of hip-length jacket made from waxed cotton cloth and it's iconic of British and Irish country life. Now, Barber is the classic brand and there are tons of examples, but I think there are so many companies now making these waxed jackets. Really what I love about these is that they are simple in design. A lot of people, they don't want leather, they want something durable, something they can go through the brush actually hunt in or just simply wear around and have a really rugged look. These jackets fit the bill. And this is simply because they were originally designed for men that were out hunting, that were out fishing, that were out shooting. Now, on the inside historically, we're going to find a cotton jacket used for insulation keeping you warm, but nowadays you're going to find all different types of materials. I really like that they've gone towards performance materials. Cotton is usually the best insulator. But the key with the waxed jacket is that the outside of it is going to have to be waxed. And this is one reason that some men stay away from them is because you do need to once a season go over and re-wax them. But if you do this over time and this is really what gives this jacket its character is that it starts to take on different hues, different looks. You can actually even use colored waxes depending on the color of the jacket. It just really has this nostalgic really cool look to it and I highly recommend that. That being said, two details if you're going to get a classic waxed jacket look for the tartan inside that's going to be a particular pattern. It's going to be a bit of brightness, a little bit of color, and around the collar. You want to go for something that has leather or corduroy. So, first up, let's talk about oxfords in particular, Balmoral oxfords. Some people just call them Balmoral's, other people call them oxfords. I'm going to use both of them. Right here we've got a captoe, so it makes it a little bit more casual. But right here we've got what's known as a closed lacing system. A closed lacing system is when the back part of the shoe, the quarter, actually goes under the front part of the shoe known as the vamp. Now, this shoe right here in black is going to be a classic dress shoe. If I were to wear this with a dark colored suit, a white shirt, and dark colored neck tie right there, that's going to be a classic business suit combination. Next up, let's talk about the blue shirt. Big difference here is these are going to be more casual because of their open lacing system. So, the back quarter of the shoe actually goes on top of the vamp. This style has always been considered to be more casual. You can also tell this is more casual shoe because of the color. You're going to see blue shirts in a variety of lighter colors, although you will still see oxfords in lighter colors. But I think that lighter color dress shoes in general are going to be more casual and the design also signals that this is more casual. So, I could wear this with a light colored suit, you know, maybe if I'm just wearing a polo with it or a dress shirt, designed to opt not to wear the neck tie. Now, another classic shoe for old money is going to be the brogue. Now, the brogue, as you can tell right here, is because of all the design. And you're going to see brogues both in open and closed lacing systems. This one actually has a closed lacing system, so a little bit dressier. And there are all types of brogues out there. You're going to see quarter brogues, you're going to see semi brogues, full brogues, and even long wing brogues. Now, full brogues are also known as wing tip brogues and that's actually the style that I've got right here. The holes used to go all the way through. Nowadays, they do not. They're for straight up decoration. But right here, you can see on the toe, we've also got a medallion. Again, it's just a design. It does make them a little bit harder to polish, but I really like the look of it and it gives a bit of a more casual feel. And let's not forget loafers. Now, really quick, let's define what a penny loafer is and what it isn't. Now, as you can see from the infographic here, the penny loafer, aka the Venetian style loafer, is easily recognizable by its lack of ornamentation. Specifically, it's a mid-heel slipper with an upper part that is slightly open to the kick of the foot and the ankle ball. Venetian loafers are slip-on shoes with no laces with a moccasin-style toe construction. Another key characteristic and where traditionally some men would put a penny is the slotted strap stitched across the vamp. In its simplest form, it's a slip-on loafer with a tongue and strap only. Now, when you compare Venetian style loafers to other styles of loafers, such as horse bit loafers, tassel loafers, Belgian loafers, monk straps, which I know are technically not loafers, but they are slip-ons, and even boat shoes, which have the moccasin design but are using laces, you can see that Venetian style, aka penny loafers, are so much cleaner, simpler, and in my opinion, versatile. So, the first watch on this old money list is Omega, the Seamaster. Now, in 1995, the Seamaster got a huge resurgence because of the movie GoldenEye, but decades prior to that, the Seamaster had built a reputation among watch wearers as simply a functional dive watch with a robust case with luminous hands, clear visible markers, and a unidirectional rotating bezel for tracking dive time. Now, there are tons of variation of the Seamaster. I have to say it doesn't retain its value super well, but it is still the classic dive watch. And pretty much no matter what style you get, this is going to be a classic old money watch. The next watch on this list hit the scene in 1972 and changed the luxury market. It did that with a groundbreaking design using nothing more than stainless steel. The brand I'm talking about, gentlemen, is Udumar Piquet and the watch is the Royal Oak. Now, over the years, AP has released tons of different designs, but the Royal Oak continues to be a symbol of the brand's innovation and is a favorite among watch connoisseurs, celebrities, and those in the know. Now, me personally, I don't own one. I've never been that attracted to them. But, I see you guys probably know a lot more about watches than I do. I would love to hear from you guys down in the comments. What do you guys think of AP? Should they have even been on this list? What do you think? And the watch I'm wearing today is made by a relatively unknown micro brand that hails from St. Louis. So, years ago, I was doing my research on micro brands and these guys kept popping up as the go-to just the most comfortable bracelet. They were using Swiss movements and from what everyone said, these guys were punching way above their price point. Also, I wanted the size under 40 millimeters. In this case, going across was 38.5 millimeters. That being said, when I saw the dial, just beautiful dial right there with the blue mixed in with that gorgeous brown leather strap, I knew I had to have this watch. Gentlemen, the watch I'm talking about is the Monta Triumph, which by the way, I like this watch so much. I ended up buying one of their Ocean Kings as well and the owners of the company are now friends of mine. So, I'll give them a shout out because they are an awesome company that stand behind their products and they're one of those emerging brands, again, that I think when you get one of their watches, you're going to be just amazed by the quality. Now, the next watch on this list is from a brand you expected to see on an old money list of watches. Of course, we're talking Rolex, but the watch I'm going to talk about is actually where it all started for Rolex back in 1926. You see, nowadays whenever somebody wants to own a Rolex, the most popular is going to be by far the Submariner. But the Submariner isn't where it all started and isn't actually the most versatile of Rolex's watches. For those in the know, the Rolex Oyster Perpetual is where it all started for the brand and in many people's opinion, this is the perfect Rolex watch especially if you're just getting started. And, straight up, that's one of the things I really do like about this watch is it is their entry level piece, yet when it comes from a watchmaking perspective, it is perfect in pretty much every regard. The next watch on this list is from Jeje LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Jeger LeCoultre. Guys, I'm a kid from the West Texas trailer park. I can't pronounce half this crap. In any case, this particular watch has been around since 1931. When it came out, it was a revolutionary design in actually the functionality of what it could do and nowadays we consider it to be an art deco masterpiece. And like a lot of the old money watches on this list, it actually has a pretty cool story. So apparently, there were these British officers that were playing polo and they wanted a watch that could be worn on the field, but could still have somehow be protected because the glass and the way that they were constructed at that time period made it very easy for them to get smashed up. Well, apparently that's where Jeger LeCoultre came in and said, hey, let's go ahead and make the reversal. So as the name implies, this watch is reversible. Basically, you can flip it over and the glass dowel right there is going to be right on the wrist and the back of the watch made out of metal is what's exposed. Nowadays, this design seems obvious, but at the time it was really unique and what was also really cool about it is you couldn't you could go, yeah, with that base metal back or you could have an engraving on there. You could actually have a picture. There were a lot of things that you could do with this. So yeah, this was like the Apple watch of the time. And nowadays this watch still works because it's understated. It's simple. It's clean. This is a luxury design. And by the way, this is a pure dress watch. The band here, the vast majority of the time is going to be leather either in black or dark brown. You can get custom ones. But the overall size of the watch is relatively small. And again, that's something traditionally we also see in dress watches. First up on this list of old money hairstyles is the French crop. Now, the French crop with the European origins can be seen as a modern interpretation of old money sophistication. What you're going to love about it is its low maintenance. It fits in with an understated elegance especially if you've got a nice transition between the sides and the top. Next up on this list, we've got the bro flow. And if you've got three to six inches of manageable hair, this may be a style you want to try to pull off. Now, as the name implies, this is a relaxed, cool laid back hairstyle. And the way you're going to style it is basically just wear the hair down and you're going to push it to the back maybe over to the side. Now, because of actors like Brad Pitt, Chris Hemsworth, Bradley Cooper, the bro flow has really become associated with a laid back cool vibe of a Hollywood type guy with a bit of means. Next up on our list, gents, let's talk about the brushed up hairstyle. If you're a young guy, you want that old money, youthful look, guys, check this style out. Now, to rock this style, you do need to have medium length hair on top. Typically around two to four inches in length. If you want something that is relatively timeless especially for a man under the age of 40, the brushed up hairstyle fits the bill. I also like that it's a bit more modern so it's not like feeling like you're back a hundred years, which to me screams young entrepreneur. Next up, we've got the side sweep and the hair here on top is going to be even longer than the brushed up. We're talking about three to five inches on top and you need that length because you're going to be folding the hair over. That being said, you want to make sure to talk to your barber, make sure you got it cut right on the sides and get a nice fade in there. The next old money hairstyle we're going to talk about, gents, is the slick back. Now, the slick back is often associated with power, with control. This is if you're a Wall Street broker, if you're a guy that lives, you got to place over in the Hamptons. This is the type of hairstyle. I think a lot of people imagine that you would have. Now, the slick back has this feel of a polished look. It looks like you put some effort and time into your hair. You've got an expensive stylist and I think that's one of the allures, one of the things that people like about this hairstyle. It looks like you got money. Next up, we've got the crew cut. Now, the crew cut can feature hair that's a little bit longer in the front than on the top of the head and it gradually gets shorter towards the back. Now, the length on top is usually pretty simple. We're talking one to two inches, so this is going to be a shorter hairstyle. And in general, this hairstyle is very short on the sides. Next up, we've got the Ivy League cut. Now, the hair on top is longer. We're talking about one and a half to two and a half to three inches in length. It's going to be long enough that we can actually part it on top, that we can change things up, we can have a little bit more fun with the style. In addition, the sides are going to be longer on an Ivy cut. So, we're not going to see anything that's showing skin. Usually on an Ivy cut on the sides of the head, we are going to have enough hair that, yeah, it's fully covered. Now, as the name implies, this one is associated with the East Coast and the higher end schools and it was just a popular hairstyle for a long time. So, you see tons of men wearing this hairstyle. It's like the default hairstyle for so many younger guys. They simply ask for an Ivy League cut. And let's not forget about the classic side part. Also sometimes called the businessman's haircut. This hairstyle involves the hair being parted on one side and combed over creating a neat and professional style. The hair on top typically ranges from two to four inches in length. Now, the sides are kept shorter, but not overly short. Again, you shouldn't be able to see skin. Now, of course, you can style this hairstyle in a wide variety of different ways depending on heat, depending on product, depending on which side you actually decide to put the part. First up on this list, I'm going back to Chanel's 1990 release, Egoist. This is a unique, beautiful, absolute masterpiece. If you want a velvety, woody, spicy floral blend, this is the fragrance you've been looking for. It's timeless, unique, sophisticated, and it's got good longevity. Now, if you want something that you can pick up in stores, let's say you're at Sephora, you're at Ulta, definitely check out Dolce & Gabbana's light blue line, specifically Italian love. It's got a really strong realistic grapefruit opening. It can be harsh for some, but, again, you can try this out, you can smell it. I think it really cools down. It's a beautiful fragrance and it's relatively affordable. And since we're here talking about the Dolce & Gabbana line, I'm going to go ahead and throw in the one. This is a very popular selling fragrance for a reason. This thing is just, it exudes class. It's going to be more for cooler months. But you got to be careful of fragrances that overuse pepper, that overuse cardamom, that use a bit too much cinnamon because it can be overpowering. So, what I recommend Spice Bomb Extreme as an old money fragrance, maybe this is definitely pushing the envelope. But if you want a spicy fragrance that's more wearable during the summer and something that flies under the radar, check out F by Farragama. That being said, if those are too common for you, two lesser known options, Tom Ford's Baudageur, released in 2020, what I love about this is this is a modern old money scent that in Tom Ford line, for some reason, a lot of guys look over. Flores 89 on the other hand, this fragrance is probably one of the oldest ones I'm talking about today. Classic, timeless, and popular with those that read in Fleming. Flores 89 is, yeah, a fragrance that has been around, but nobody seems to know about unless you're a James Bond fan. Now, if you want an earthy fragrance that's a little bit more mainstream, very wearable, check out Gucci Guilty Absolute Por-Om. This one flies under the radar compared to the other flankers. Everyone's like, ah, what was this? This was a beautiful earthy old school type of fragrance and probably the most popular when it comes to earthy fragrances that will get you compliments, even with that dirty orange smell is going to be Teradimes by Hermes. This is their flagship fragrance and a masterpiece. Now, really quick, a few fragrances I did not want to leave off this list. We got Panhelegans Sartorial. If you are dressing up, you're wearing black tie, you're in London, this is the fragrance for you. Next up, you want to be more attractive. You want to draw in the ladies. You want that old school money vibe that's going to draw in the women. Guys, check out Angel Shares Killian. So, sweeter fragrances, fragrances that smell like vanilla. I didn't really put on this list because traditionally they're not old money, but this one is an exception. It's got that smoky, this one is absolutely beautiful. Now, some of you guys are saying, Antonio, what about other timeless items? Well, guys, I got you covered right here with this video. You enjoy today's video. You're going to love this one. Check it out. Boom, right here. Oh, yeah. Come on. You want to do it. Boom. Right there. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom."

        "transcript": " So, I got this email the other day, Antonio, I want to fly you out to help me build a complete new wardrobe. I'll pay for your flight, food, hotel, everything. The money is no issue. I just don't have the time and I trust your opinion because I love your style, I love what you talk about on your channel. So, how much is it going to cost to get you out here? I need your help. So, at least a few times a year, I get messages like this. And every time I receive these messages, I'm flattered, but I always say no. No, God, please no. No. And don't get me wrong, it's not because I don't want to make money or help this guy. It's just that that's not my business model. As many of you guys know with seven kids, five businesses, I'm in the season of my life that I don't travel much and I need to be around for my family. Huh? That being said, I followed up with the gentleman, I gave him some guidance and I realized the plan of action I laid out for my seven-step plan to rebuilding his image, I could give to you all at no cost in this video. So, how to rebuild your image in a matter of days so that you're looking amazing this next year? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video. So, when I was talking with Michael, I said the first thing we need to do is to identify the image, the style that you want to project. Before you go anywhere, you need to know where you're going. So, defining your goals, defining your style identity is step number one. Your image, your personal presentation speaks for you before you even open your mouth. How do you want the world to see you? How do you want the world to interpret your image? A sharp professional, maybe an approachable leader, maybe a refined gentleman or a confident man. Now, of course, you can choose a variety of adjectives here. I try to start with no more than five and from this, we're going to create an inspiration board. We're going to go online using Google Image Search, Instagram, Pinterest, or Facebook, but we want to find actual images and pictures that illustrate the display that capture the look that you're going for. And remember, gents, the key here is to keep this practical. You may like suits, but day to day if you don't wear a suit, your job, your profession or simply your habits, have you wearing casual clothing most of the time? Well, then, look to find inspiring casual styles that are maybe one or two steps up above what you're currently wearing and that's going to be where we want to start. Having said that, don't limit yourself. If you really like casual suits, but they're not something you normally wear, well, go ahead and pin them and start looking for those pieces because maybe you can find something on sale and then you can find the occasion to wear it. The key here is to be inspired to be able to develop a direction of where you want to go. Step number two, purge and evaluate. On a side note, the purging movies, I absolutely love them. I don't know why they're such a guilty pleasure, especially the first one. Now, purging when it comes to your wardrobe is simply to eliminate the items that are causing confusion. The reality for a lot of guys is that they have clothing in their closet that they just need to get rid of. Seriously, we want to go through your closet and divide everything into three categories. We got love it, we got like it, and then we have lose it. So, if it doesn't fit you and it can't be adjusted to fit you, if it is stained, if it cannot be repaired, if you haven't worn the item for two years and you're never going to wear the item, all these items you want to throw into the lose it pile. Now, I know some of you guys are hoarders and you're going to say, Antonio, I may need that in five years. In that case, put it into a box, tape it up, put the date on it. And in five years when you find this box and you haven't opened it, you know that you can donate it safely. Now, the like it category for most guys, this is where the majority of their clothing is going to go. These are pieces that get the job done, you like them, but when you put these items on, they don't enhance your image, you don't feel like a million bucks putting these pieces on. Now, the love it category, again, for most guys is going to be a small percentage. These are the items in that particular color with that particular pattern that every time you wear, you get a compliment, you feel good. It's that sports jacket that every time you put it on, you feel like a million bucks. It's those boots that make you taller and every time you wear them, you feel like the man. The love it category that you want to pay special attention to because in an ideal world, everything in your closet is eventually going to fall into this category. So, with the items you're putting in there, you want to say, hey, is there an item here that I need to replace? I need to get either another one or I need to make sure I get something like it because if I were to lose this item, it really would leave a hole in my wardrobe. In addition, now that we've gotten rid of some items that were in the lose it category, you may identify, hey, you know what, I don't have a pair of jeans that I love. This is a big hole in my wardrobe that I need to fill. Do you not have a single casual jacket that you can slip on that makes you look great in a color that compliments your skin tone if you don't have this? And, hey, we're in winter the height of the season, this is something you need to be looking for. Maybe you've got a lot of dress shirts, but none of them fit you well. You've lost weight, congratulations. Guess what? Now, reward yourself by going out there and finding a dress shirt that doesn't have to be in any fancy color you can go with a white, but instead you choose one that fits your new body type and shows off all the time that you've put into the gym. And when it comes to footwear, depending on your style, you can go with a pair of dress boots, maybe chakkas or chelsea's, or if you want some a little bit dressier, find a pair of loafers that every time you put these on, you feel amazing. You love the way the colors on that shoe play with each other. Our end goal here is to be able to put together at least one preferably a few good looking outfits that when you look at yourself in the mirror, you can't help but agree that, damn, I look good. Now, at this point, some of you guys are thinking, Antonio, this all sounds nice, but none of this matters if you don't have your health, if you don't have your wealth, if you don't have purpose in life. And you know what? I 100% agree because all things being equal, a man that's fit, a man that's healthy is going to look better in the same clothing than a man that's not. A bit of wealth, a bit of money sure makes it a lot easier to be able to pick up the items that we're talking about in today's video. And, of course, if a man doesn't have direction, if he doesn't have a reason, if he doesn't have purpose, well, if he doesn't have those things, it doesn't matter how well dressed a man is, he's just an empty suit float namelessly. Well, gents, here's the deal. If you're a man in your 30s, 40s, or 50s, look at the level yourself up to find a community of like-minded warriors out there trying to improve their health, wealth, and purpose. Well, gents, if that's you, you need to check out our new community, HWP. Over at HWP, we've got a step-by-step program to help men become their best selves. I've developed this program over the last decade, leveraging my experience as a former officer of Marines, business owner, and father. The reality is when you're 35, 45, 55, it's very difficult to find like-minded men looking to improve themselves. At HWP, we've got a supportive community and we embrace the idea that daily through small actions, if you just get better by 1%, over the period of months, you're going to see compound improvements and take measurable steps towards becoming the man you know yourself to be. Gents, if this all sounds interesting, down in the description of today's video, go check us out. I'm putting a link over to Health Wealth Purpose or you can just type it in your search bar healthwealthpurpose.com. And, yeah, you can learn more and see if this program is right for you. Quick note, this is an invitation-only group, meaning that you need to go through an application process. And I personally look over every application and do the interviews because we've discovered that it's really important we get the right fit, the right type of guys that are going to bring in the right energy, guys that are willing to show up and do the work to become their best self. Also, the average age is about 48 and there's only 20 men in each class. So, don't wait, apply today, use the link in the description of today's video and we'll get back to you. The next step is to understand the fundamentals of fit and proportion. So, let's look at this image right here. We've got the same gentleman, but notice how one suit fits and the other one is way too large. Now, just have the suit that fits, it complements him and makes him look great. The suit that doesn't fit? Yeah, it doesn't matter that he spent thousands of dollars on it, it just looks bad. And, you may think this is obvious, but the problem is when you walk into a store, the items being pushed on you are caught in a fashion trend. Yeah, 15 years ago, we saw a really tight ultra small suits being pushed. Now, the pendulum is swinging to the other side where guys are starting to wear baggy suits. The key that you need to understand is depending on your body type, there is going to be a range of fits that suit your natural build. But, the key here is to find the cut that works for you and if you're buying an item that can be adjusted, that can be tailored, which is by the way most clothing, then get it adjusted to fit you better. In fact, one question I usually ask guys who are looking to improve their style, what's the name of your tailor? If you don't have a tailor, then go out there and find one because these guys can work wonders in making your dress shirts and making your trousers, your jeans, your jackets, fits you better and hence making you look better. Now, proportion and style is a little bit more advanced, but it is not the same thing as clothing fit. In fact, when we look at this image right here, we can see the difference in proportion of the head. Notice how on the giant man, the head overall is smaller in proportion to the body. Compare that to a smaller man, his head in proportion to his body is going to be larger. Now, you don't need to be an expert on proportions, but when you're working with your tailor, when you are finding clothing that suits you, you want to make sure it is balancing your proportions. So, if you're shaped like a pair, you've got narrow shoulders, but wider hips, you're going to want to make sure to wear a jacket that actually builds out the shoulders a bit. It doesn't have to be too much, but if you don't wear that jacket and you wear a light colored shirt with dark trousers, your pair shape, let's face it, most guys don't like this shape is going to be exaggerated. Now, some of that logic also applies to a shorter man because your head in proportion to your body is going to be larger, so jackets are going to build out the shoulders and therefore make your head look more proportioned. On the flip side, if you're muscular, if you're a bodybuilder, you are not going to want to wear an overly structured jacket. No, if you're looking at sports jackets, you want to look for a jacket with Neapolitan shoulders. These are going to be smoother, almost no padding and they're going to make you look good, not like a cartoon character. First up, you want to invest in interchangeable staples. So, earlier in this video, we talked about identifying the holes in your wardrobe. You want to put together some outfits and you probably have identified maybe a pair of trousers, a few shirts, maybe a jacket, maybe a few pairs of shoes that if you just added these things to your wardrobe, all of a sudden, you would have a lot more possibilities especially if you loved every single one of those items. Well, one of the keys to loving an item isn't necessarily to getting compliments all the time on it, but it really comes down to your ability to wear it with pretty much anything. Hence why I push interchangeability. Now, interchangeability in case you remember that's where your jacket, your shirt, your trousers, your shoes, everything works together. So, in this case, we have 16 items four in each category and someone that doesn't understand interchangeability may say, oh, that's going to be perfect for four outfits. However, if you're understanding interchangeability, you know that you can actually wear any of those trousers with any of those shoes with any of those jackets with any of those shirts. Therefore, the number of outfits here isn't four, it's actually 256. Yeah, the first time someone's exposed this, it's mind blowing. The idea that you could own less clothing if it all mixes and matches with everything else in your wardrobe and be able to get more outfits and come. This is what we're talking about, right? Now, an important concept to understand with interchangeability is the need for neutral colors. Black, white, navy, gray, brown, tan, all the other shades are those of four mentioned colors. These colors are very easy to mix and match. Therefore, they become cornerstone pieces for an interchangeable wardrobe. Now, up to this point, we've been talking about clothing, but now, let's talk about your grooming. Hair, skin, nails, you're probably doing the basics. But if you want to level up your game, if you want to rebuild your image, you need to set appointments with professionals. Find a set of appointments with the best stylist, the best esthetician, and yes, make an appointment at a salon for a manicure and possibly even a pedicure. I know some of you guys are like, Antonio, come on, I'm a man, I would never do that stuff. But, I think in that way, you probably are scared of what other people are going to say or think. And even if you aren't, well, let me explain my logic here. In my experience, having helped thousands of men improve their image over the last decade, I find it's the men who invest a little bit of money, yes, put their hard-earned dollars down on the table to improve their image. These are the guys that actually pay attention, show up and do the work. So, with your hair, you're going to cheat on your barber. Yes, you've been going to the same guy for 20 years. Here's the thing. Even you're the same cut you've always asked for versus a stylist is going to shampoo your hair and look at your face shape. Look at the way maybe your hair is thin and find a style that actually suits you. And, pay attention to what he or she is doing. Ask questions about the product they're using about, hey, you're using a blow dryer. I've never used one. How would I use this? Ask questions about how to better take care of your hair. And if you've got a beard, if you've got a mustache, if you've got hair growing everywhere and you've always wondered, hey, how would I go about manscaping? Don't be afraid to ask these questions to get a suggestion because let's get over to the manicure, the pedicure. Now, I understand the hesitation on this one. This is a domain mostly of women, but, hey, walk in there and if nothing else, treat yourself to the massage to just simply feeling like a king. But, the reality is when a man spends money on his nails, he actually sees why so many women love this. And, if you're one of those guys that bites your nails after you've spent 50 to 100 bucks to take care of your nails, you're going to find all of a sudden, you know what? I'm not going to bite on something that I spent good money on. And now, let's talk about estheticians. It's about two different ways. There are two types out there. In any case, you want to go to somebody that has seen hundreds if not thousands of people and their skin and can actually go over on your skin and identify, hey, you know, I've always wondered is that a mole or is that some type of cancerous thing that I need to maybe go see a doctor about? But, seriously, these estheticians, they love to teach people about, okay, you want to use this product, you want to set up this routine. And, again, when you've spent a little bit of money on this, you are more likely to follow through and then start taking steps to just simply take care of the largest organ on your body. Yes, that's your skin, guys. Get your mind out the gutter. Next up, let's talk about your accessories, the small things, sunglasses. I think that, you know, this right here, they frame your face. Find a style that suits you. I see so many guys that spend money on a great haircut, got a great outfit on and their sunglasses absolutely suck. Now, aviators are going to be the go-to suit most face shapes, but I love club masters. They're not as difficult to wear as wayfarers, but yet the style factor on these things, it really can level up your look. And the only face shape I don't think they work for is if you've got a wider forehead and a thinner jaw, then you're going to want to avoid that style. But, in that case, maybe look at the wayfarers or just stick with the aviators. Now, the next accessory you want to pay attention to is the watch. Now, studies have shown that most people don't know a whole lot about watches or the watch brands. So, don't get fixed in on a Rolex and think you got to spend, you know, $10,000 plus on a watch for it to be impressive. Now, find a brand, find a style that suits you. Most people if they even notice the watch will just simply notice it because it has a bit of shine because it has a bit of color or perhaps because it's a bit larger. But, in any case, a true watch affectionate, he's going to be impressed that you're just simply another watch guy. And what's really fun here is you get to start the conversation with other watch people. And that's where if you do get into watches, then, yeah, that's where you start going down this whole rabbit hole. And, yeah, as this chart shows here, you start off with a Seiko, you eventually go and spend all this money, you mortgage your house to get that one watch. And then, where do you end up going at the end of the whole journey? Yes, back to that original Seiko that you loved. Yeah, you personally, I love watches, but I am over spending a lot of money on them. Now, in the case of the gentleman that I talked about earlier that had offered to fly me out, he was going to be a traveling businessman and he was going to be giving presentations, he was representing his company, he had a lot of money that was flowing in and out. And so, in this case, we actually looked for a briefcase and for a series of luggage and bags that actually better suited the style that he wanted to project. Now, this isn't going to be for everybody, but I do think spending money on a nice bag that's going to serve you especially made from leather of high quality, this is going to be a lifetime investment. So, I do think spending a little bit more money here is warranted especially if you're still using that backpack that you used as a student over a decade ago. Yeah, if you've got a suit jacket, if you've got a sport jacket or a blazer jacket, you do not want to throw a backpack on that. It can ruin the shoulders and just it's like trying to mix oil and water, it just doesn't go. That being said, if you love backpacks, there are some higher quality, some really nice ones I've talked about before in my videos. But, yeah, there are ways to step up the backpack. I'm not throwing it under the bus. I think it's a useful accessory, useful tool, but, yeah, you want the style of that backpack to work with the style you are projecting with your clothing and your image. Next up, we've got practice, evaluate and adjust. So, you can have a wardrobe of amazing clothing, an awesome watch, a hairstyle that oozes style. But, unless you practice putting it together and wearing it out and putting in the reps, well, gents, if you're not used to wearing it, it is going to be a costume. You see that have true style, spritzatura is to actually be able to wear that clothing with effortless ease or at least for it to appear as effortless ease. Because, yes, there's a bit of maintenance and upkeep, you got to shine the shoes. But, by practicing putting these outfits together and actually wearing them out and about, you're then going to be able to evaluate what works. What do you actually like? What do you feel comfortable wearing? What gets you compliments and if compliments don't matter because I know they don't matter to a lot of you guys? Yes, you tell me in the comments. Well, then, how does that clothing actually make you feel? And, is there anything you want to improve? And that's where you're going to adjust. You're going to find some items you're going to buy and you're going to have wasted your money because you're not going to like them as much as you thought you were. Don't worry, that's not a bad thing that just means you are human. But, by going through this loop, you're going to use, you're going to actually get value from the new wardrobe, the new image that you've created. And that being said, gents, I've got you covered with another video, boom, right here. Yeah, come on, don't stop watching. I got you covered, boom, right here. Check it out. Solid video. Yeah, I know you'll like it right there. Come on. Click. Come on. Boom, right there. Yeah."

        "transcript": " These are the top fragrances from this year. So, the first fragrance that is going to probably surprise some of you guys, but, hey, it's a personal preference. I love coconut. I love tropical islands and this fragrance right here is just so beautiful, so wearable. And the more that I wear it, the more I love it. I'm talking about Jean Paul Gattier's Le Beau Paradise Garden, a spring summer fragrance that dominates during the day. You can also wear this into the night. This is beast mode. We're talking I got 12 plus hours with three sprays of this stuff. It leans masculine and if you like the DNA of the original Le Beau, you're going to love this one. I feel with a couple of sprays, you could wear this into the office in the winter when you're thinking about escaping to a tropical island. It's unique if you don't have a fragrance like this in your collection. Look at it. Now, the next fragrance I'm going to talk about is Versace Aeros Energy. I've just been loving it. The name is spot on and it's just got a fresh clean opening that I love to smell again and again, but this fragrance is so different from all the other ones yet it is so damn good. In my opinion, they could have gone with an entirely new line. Now, be warned, this fragrance is citrus heavy especially that opening and for the first hour. And some people are comparing this to Aventus clone. I will say that that is close. Aventus clone has a lot more depth. Now, the notes here are interesting. You notice all the different citruses across the top. I definitely get the lemon bergamot even a bit of the orange and the nice soft musk bit of pepper at the base which is there and I have gotten compliments two days after wearing this fragrance. And it has a guy with over 600 fragrances in his collection. The fact that I wore this for like three to four days straight, well, that says something. Now, this next fragrance was one of the more surprising fragrances that I didn't expect to like. The notes are pretty simple as you can see here. Overall, a relatively simple fragrance, but that combination I thought was absolutely beautiful. It surprised me coming out of the line. It did because in general, I find most of their fragrances uninspiring, but, yeah, I got to give props where props are due. And the fragrance I'm talking about is Valentino Umos Born in Roma Green Stravaganza. Now, I don't pick up the coffee much, but I do pick up that citrus at the top and then at that base, this is a solid classic Vettiver fragrance. That being said, because of that well blended coffee note, it's not a one-dimensional Vettiver. So, if you have something like Tom Ford's, you know, Vettiver, the Parfum, or the EDP, this one is going to be very different despite having such similar notes. And it's also worth mentioning compared to all the other Valentino flankers, this one is very different. Masculine fun, green, creamy, and I love that mix of the citrus with the coffee. It shouldn't go together, but in this case, it does. In fact, the only issue I have with this fragrance is the longevity could be a bit longer, maybe it could project more, but just spray a bit more on. It is a really unique nice fragrance. Now, one of the reasons I thought this last year was amazing for new releases is there were so many good citrus fragrances. So, this is Parfum de Marlis Perseus. It's a citrus woody aromatic with a very prominent, very strong grapefruit. Now, there's a lot of other notes listed and after a couple hours, you do get past the strong citrus and you get down to the nice woody base. And after a minute, it's that citrus, it's that opening that I absolutely love. To me, when I smell this, this is a beast mode version of Terre de Meses au Javeret, which is a great fragrance in of itself. That being said, the dry down is muskier, it's sweeter, and I think that this one is going to get you a lot more compliments. Now, this next fragrance is making a heck of a lot of money for Polo and that is their new established 67. It's a very simple aromatic citrus wood that's incredibly likeable. And I'm thinking if you're looking to get a gift for a teenager, this would be a great fragrance to give them. If you want to clean, soft, citrus top, a tata floor with just a bitter earth at the base, this could be the perfect summer scent for you. Now, is this going to win any awards for originality? No. But it's fun, it's vibrant, it's youthful, and it's easy to find. Now, this next fragrance, I know a lot of people, again, because of expectations, have panned this fragrance. The fragrance I'm talking about is Chanel's new release Super Ledgera, which basically means super light. I personally have been holding out for the blue to Chanel Elixir, but they surprised us with this release in the online. And really, this one takes me back to one of the first Chanel fragrances I ever purchased, Elore-on-Clone. It's got that nice citrus top and I can smell a bit of the orange, but it's incredibly creamy, incredibly smooth. So, you could wear this in 40 degrees Celsius weather or spray a bit more of wear it out on a date in October. Now, again, like a lot of you guys, I wanted something else, but you know what? For what this fragrance is, it's good. Next up, we have Yves Saint Laurent's 2024 release, Myself Le Paufeau. Now, if you don't own the EDP, you're a man in your 30s, 40s, or 50s and you like the DNA, you want something, you got that polo sounds for teenagers, then this one is going to be the one you want to grab. The Le Paufeau is a darker, sexier, more sophisticated version of the original. Is it unique? No. Does it smell great? Yes. Now, at this point, you may be asking, come on, Antonio, give me a fragrance that you do like. One that exceeded expectations. So, first up, we've got Zara's, the most wanted intense. A citrus lavender mossy fragrance with a bit of spice, this was one of those hidden gem releases that most people aren't talking about that me personally, I think is amazing. And, yes, I know some people have compared it to Yves Saint Laurent's Myself, but you can definitely tell the difference. This one is more masculine, it's got cajones. Now, if you're watching this and thinking, Antonio, come on, you got all these designer fragrances, how about something niche? All right, let's pull in Mespecese's A Wonderful Flight. This is a beautiful citrus. It's going to be a little bit more complex than Eros Energy. It has a beautiful top, but it also has an earthier base that you can pick up within the first hour of wearing it. And, like all Mespecese's fragrances, it comes in this really cool container that basically looks like a book and then it opens up and boom, you got the fragrance right there. Now, gents, if you're looking to buy fragrances online, you want to make sure you get the real deal. If you're looking for niche, hard to find fragrances, then you want to get over to Maxaroma. Fragrances like Em McLeath, I've talked about the original, Desire Toxic, this is the new Desire Toxic Intense. It's an aromatic warm, spicy green citrus fragrance that's very unique. And, some of you guys know, I don't normally like a cannabis note, this thing is blended beautifully. And, gents, I'm telling you, if you're looking for some of the best fragrances on the planet coming out of the Middle East, check out the spirit of Dubai. Right here, as you can see, I've got Bosqueer, an amazing fragrance, a little bit complex, or maybe you want something slightly different, check out a Jarbois. Absolutely beautiful packaging, absolutely beautiful bottle, and what I love about the spirit of Dubai, these guys know how to blend notes. And on a personal note, the fragrance I'm wearing today, check out the house of Ojar specifically Wood Whisperer. This is a woody powder amber fragrance with a really clean woody powdery smell that gets compliments. And, besides Wood Whisperer, if I would recommend any fragrance for a blind buy, check out Em Meekalaf's Red Colorado. You got the pines with the woods, it's a very simple yet complex, absolutely beautiful fragrance. And the best thing about Maxaroma is you can get samples before you buy a full-on bottle. Down in the description of today's video, I'm linking over to Maxaroma with the best deals you're going to find this holiday season. Next up, we've got Paco Rabon's Invictus. Not just any Invictus, I got the brand new Parfum. This fragrance is not as marine or aquatic as we see a lot of the Invictus fragrances are. In fact, it's more of an aromatic musk-like fragrance. In general, I've stayed away from the Invictus lime because I felt it was too synthetic. However, this new Invictus Parfum is absolutely beautiful. It's smooth and when I was wearing this the other day, my wife couldn't keep her hands off me. She's like, well, I don't know what you're wearing, but this is one of the best fragrances I've ever smelled on you. What I like about this one, it's affordable, it's new, you can find it. It's definitely going to get your compliments like it did with me and it's going to draw in the ladies. A really easy win and it doesn't matter if you're a teenager, if you are in your 70s, I think you can pull this fragrance off. So, Dolce & Gabbana's K, Oda Parfum Intense is the third in its line and it is the best. When the EDT originally came out a couple of years ago, I thought it was renamed. When the EDP came out, it was a big improvement. But, this new one, the Intense, I'd have to say is the best. And, if you know the backstory, apparently Dolce & Gabbana took back control of their fragrances. They even got like a metal lid on this one. So, overall, everyone's believing the quality has stepped up at this house and this is reflected. That being said, if you already have the EDP, if you have the EDT, I'm sorry, but no, if you got the EDP, this is going to be, you know, I don't think you need to upgrade, just simply put on a little bit more. They are very similar. That being said, if this is your first K fragrance, then jump for the Intense. Now, don't be confused by those notes that leather is not overpowering. I get fresh, clean, spicy, very similar to the EDP, but with more power and more projection. So, yeah, if you're just going to choose one in the K line, this is the one to go with. Unless you want a boring office scent, then I guess go with the EDT. Next up, we've got Montblanc's Legend Blue. This one just came out and the red was pretty forgettable. Legend is very easy to wear fragrances and Montblanc ain't doing anything new, so the expectations were relatively low, but this thing slightly exceeded expectations. It's fresh, it's pleasant, it's going to get you compliment. It punches above its weight. And I was surprised how similar or actually, you know, maybe closer to the original Ampo Cromby and Finch this one was. So, I would still go, by the way, with the Oda Parfum. Not only is this one been on a little bit longer, so you can probably find it at discounters, so you'll have to pay full price like you do with this one. I think that this one projects more. That being said, this one is a little bit smoother. It does have a little bit of that blue vibe, so I see why people like it. But, at the end of the day, Montblanc keeps repeating this fragrance because it works because it's a crowd pleaser because people love it. They get compliments and whichever one you go with here, you are going to get compliments when you wear it. Next up, we've got a fragrance from Carolina Herrera and that is going to be Bad Boy Cobalt Elixir. An earthy fresh spicy vanilla with a bit of wood, this is a really nice fragrance. Now, I thought the original Cobalt was a fine fragrance. Some people found certain notes off pudding. I really liked especially the plum note. So, with that, you may be wondering is it similar to the original? The answer is yes. The DNA is there, but it's only like half of it because this one is amped up, it's stronger, it's fresher, yet it's still a little bit animalistic. And I do miss the plum, but this one is unique. It's a solid pick up one of the best. It's the better of the Cobalt's. Next up, let's talk about Burberry Hero Parfum. Now, Burberry has been busy last few years taking my money. They came out with the EDT, they came out with the EDP. Now, they just came out with the Parfum in 2024. And as you can see from this chart, gentlemen, they have kept it consistent, getting stronger, more intense, and darker as they strengthen the formula. That being said, the Parfum at its heart is what all Hero fragrances have been, crowd pleasing, easy to wear fragrances that Burberry knows are going to sell. The face of this was Adam Driver. Now, the ad materials were kind of weird. It was a horse, he was shirtless, what was going on here. And because Burberry is considered a lower tier fragrance house, I think a lot of guys just slept on this, just passed up the fragrance, really didn't think much of it. And I bought all three with my own money and I have to say that they are actually better than I thought they would be. So, you can pull this off the heat, you can pull this off the cold. This is an easy wear for season fragrance that, yeah, would make a great gift. And even though I haven't gotten compliments with this one, I've read the reviews, I've seen what other people are saying. A lot of people are just getting compliments with this thing. So, give it a shot. Especially I love the fact that you can walk into usually any box store, you can find this one, yeah, Burberry did a good job with this one. Next up, we have Yves Saint Laurent's Y Elixir. Now, if you like lavender, if you like wood, which most people do, this fragrance is perfectly fine. But, for an elixir and for what they're charging, guys, I just expected a bit more from this house. The line is fine, it's a crowd of pleasing line, but, yeah, this one doesn't really do anything for me. Now, what if you already own a Y fragrance? In that case, I would say you want to skip this one because the elixir, even though it's a great fragrance, it's very similar to the Y EDP, just a little bit stronger. Not as strong as I would have liked to have seen it, but, yeah, it's basically just a souped up version of this one. Now, this next fragrance, I feel the house was holding back on us. I know they're probably going to come out with another variation of it, which will be stronger, which they have done with everything. But, we're talking about Victor and Rolf Spice Bomb and this is their dark leather. Now, despite the fact that for a spice bomb, this doesn't have much longevity, which for that is like six hours. And it doesn't project as much. Victor and Rolf kicks butt when it comes to unique fragrances that basically grab people's attention when you walk into a room. And the pepper is there, the cinnamon is there, the black leather with the tobacco, yeah, you can pick that up. It's just my only reservation with this is, man, they should have made it stronger. I guess I can overspray and just, you know, wear more of it, but, yeah, this one is nice. So, this next fragrance for me, I really did like the original scandal with the caramel note and the, you know, the parfum was really nice as well. This one, the absolute just, it was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was forgettable. It just reminded me of a lot of other fragrances I have. It's woody, fruity, warm, spicy, and I really wanted to pick up that unique Mirabelle note, but I just didn't get it. And, by the way, if you've watched this far in your thing in Antonio, what do you do with all these extra fragrances that you have? Because I am giving away my fragrance collection. Well, guys, that's over at the Brotherhood of Scent. I'll put a link in the description. That's our amazing community of frag heads that we have over on the school platform. So, go check it out. Not only am I giving away my fragrance collection, but we've got free courses and shoot the shit with other frag heads. People share where they get their best deals. Yeah, it's a solid community and usually I'm giving away a fragrance a week and they're absolutely free. So, you guys probably have seen the house, Givenchy. I think a lot of their stuff is very confusing. Again, that's why I create infographics like this that break it all out, make it easy for you which you can get for free over in our Brotherhood of Scent. That being said, let's talk about two of their most recent releases. As you can see, these two bottles are eerily similar. So, make sure to read the bottom. You've got the one that came out in 2023, Givenchy's Gentleman's Society. And then, you've got the new one that just came out, the new Oda Parfum Extreme. So, I'm going to highlight the Oda Parfum Extreme. Both of them are fine fragrances, but what's interesting about the Oda Parfum Extreme, it's got this iced coffee note which I think is really unique. It doesn't last for a whole long, but it's long enough there that you can pick it up and you can walk into a box store and actually try this one out. I really like it. It's going to be if this is more of a gourmandess, we talked about that's why it's going to get you compliments. And if you like coffee, this one is great because you don't have to, you know, put the caffeine in the bloodstream and you can wear this in the afternoon or in the evening and it's just it's a really nice smooth fragrance. Next up, we have Prada's Lunarosa Ocean Le Parfum. It's a very versatile, deep rich, sweet fragrance. Notice the saffron note there. Again, the issue they've got here with this fragrance is they misnamed it. I don't know why it has the ocean name in it. All that being said, I do like the fact that this one is different than the other flankers in the line. It probably should have been called elixir. All right. So, you get to see my balancing act here. Let's see hopefully these don't fall. So, a few years back Prada came out with the Lunarosa Ocean Line or at least they started it. Right here actually this one right here, we have the Ocean, the EDT. This one I thought was decent. I thought the name was a bit deceptive. It didn't have the ocean feel. And what's interesting is they've progressively gotten away from the overall ocean type of. So, when you get this fragrance, that's what I want to hit on here. The EDP, if you like this but you felt it was a little bit too sweet, you want something a little bit spicier, then you want to check out the Le Parfum. But get your nose on this because it smells nothing like the ocean. That being said, it is a beautiful scent. It's woody amber warm spicy. It's going to have that citrus at the top. It's got that saffron in the middle, so it's going to be really sweet. Again, this is a different than the vanilla that we've been talking about a lot of the other fragrances. Still, it's going to have that sweetness which is going to get you the compliments. And at the base, it's got Ambrox. Now, it's supposed to and I would think it would project in the last longer. It lasted decent. I wouldn't say this is a beast, but I do think it's a really nice fragrance. And again, one that you can easily get your nose on when you walk into a store. So, yeah, you want to learn more about men's fragrances. I got you covered. Boo, check out this video right here, a solid one. Oh, yeah. Go check it out right there."

        "transcript": " Guys, it's cold outside and in today's video, I am going to tell you guys about some of the winter essentials you must have. First up, gents, we've got classic winter headwear. You got to protect that head during the winter. Right here, I've got the classic watch cap also known as the stocking cap, the night cap, the beanie. It goes by various names. Now, if you want to know the differences, beanies usually have a little ball on top and yes, men can wear them. Stocking caps, night caps, those are going to be a little bit longer. Now, the thing about the watch cap, it is a casual cap and there are other options out there if you're looking to actually wear something with a nice overcoat to dress up a bit and still be warm. Next up, we've got the classic flat cap also known as an ivy cap. So, this one here made from a nice felt. It's going to be in wool, so it's going to provide insulating properties. It also has an expansion right here, so it could protect my ears whenever I wear this. Now, you may be wondering what's the difference between this and the new spoi. The new spoi is actually usually going to have a pin right here and it's going to be fuller in the overall design. Both of these look great when pairing them with an overcoat and basically more formal clothing. Next up, we've got the Ushanka also known as the trapper hat or the aviator hat. What I love about this hat is you can wear it up, you can wear it down to protect your cheeks, protect your ears. It is a very versatile hat. And when worn up traditionally in parts of the world like Russia or over in Ukraine, you're going to find that this is a formal hat that can be worn even with a suit. Next up, we've got the Astrakhan, this hat coming out of East Asia. And why I like this one here is it's actually made from a very dense lambs wool. It does a great job of insulating the head, protecting you from wind all with a really unique type of style. You're not going to see this hat out there and I think actually it could be added to a man's wardrobe to help him stand out from the crowd and still be worn. Number two on my casual wardrobe essentials, gentlemen, I've got the long sleeve Henley. But when you're looking at a long sleeve Henley, again, go for solid dark colors or light colors as well. This is something that you wouldn't always wear it by itself, but it's going to be great for layering. As I talked about with the cotton shirt jacket, this is something that you can wear with a long sleeve. This is something that you could throw that right over this. It looks great. It's much nicer than a t-shirt. Now, if the Henley is not for you as an alternative, look at the long sleeve polo. A lot of us have had short sleeve polos. Long sleeve polos are a little bit harder to find, but I think they're great for a man's wardrobe especially again when you want to layer. Next up, gents, we've got sunglasses. And if you know your history and you watch Real Men Real Style, you know I've talked about how sunglasses have been worn by men for thousands of years especially up in northern regions when they're hunting, they need to be able to make things out despite the glare, hence why sunglasses originated. But sunglasses also originated because to protect your eyes from that cold wind, it can dry it out, it could actually blind you. So hence sunglasses very useful during the winter. The next winter accessory, gentlemen, is going to be the right winter fragrance. So I'm putting this as an accessory because I do think that there are summer fragrances, there are winter fragrances, but really once you get into this, you start to realize what I'm looking for in a winter fragrance is something that's going to last long, something that's going to have strong projection. Why? Because I want to be able to put it on in the morning, I'm going to put on multiple layers of clothing and it actually has to work its way through. Now, specifically what are you looking for in a winter fragrance? You're going to look for cinnamon, you're going to look for nutmeg, look for vanilla, look for something that's complex, something that has depth. And me personally, I love incense in my fragrance during the winter because it reminds me of going to midnight mass as a kid and that's the key is you got to find something that has meaning to you. But two things again, look for something that has sillage basically projection and something that's going to last a long time. Next up on our list, gentlemen, is the casual button down. And this is something you've probably heard you've probably already got a few in your wardrobe, but are you really maximizing this? Are you going and exploring and bringing a lot of fun ones into your wardrobe? Now, there are three things I like to look for. Number one color, let's number two, let's look at the style. And number three, let's look at the fabric choice. So, number one, the color. Did you notice the orange button down I'm wearing right here? Open this up and show you guys. This is a pretty bright color and something maybe by itself I wouldn't wear, but when I layer it, when I bring in other bits of clothing, I'm able to in a sense draw attention to my neck area pointing to the face. It's almost like a necktie. And if you're not into that, then go with something that maybe has kind of more of a rugged feel, olive green, one of my favorite colors, but you can bring in dark blues, variations of blues. I also bring in mixed weaves where you've got this one is actually a white with a very dark blue which gives off this lighter blue look. Whatever it is, gentlemen, experiment with color and have fun with your button downs. Next up, gents, we've got thermal underwear and with everything look at the style pyramid. It matters a lot, yes, in underwear. Fit, make sure it fits you. Any tight spots, this is fitting close to your body, it's going to irritate you. Do not buy it if it's too tight or way too loose. You want to be able to layer it. Next up, look at the fabric. For me, I want something that is not going to be at all itchy next to the body. So if you have issues with wool, do not wear a wool insulating thermal underwear. Next up, should you go for the single piece or go for the double piece? Me, I prefer double piece when it comes to thermal underwear because I like to be able to wear maybe the top or just wear the bottom depending on the other clothing I'm wearing. Next up, gentlemen, we've got textured sweaters. Textured sweaters, sweaters with patterns with intricate designs in them. They're made to be worn by themselves or they can be layered. What I like about these is they give a bit of depth. They can really build up your chest area. I've got one that's got an air knot going across here, so that builds up my arms, builds up my chest. But what I like is I can wear them in lieu of a sports jacket or \u2013 and this really depends on how lightweight the weave is \u2013 you can actually layer them. If it becomes a heavier weave, maybe made from a coarse cotton or a coarse wool, it's going to be something that's going to be harder to layer depending on the size of your jacket. But if it's lightweight, made from maybe cashmere or a very finely woven wool, you will be able to wear it under a sports jacket. Again, we're talking about layering here, but when looking at these sweaters, what you want to focus it on is the fit. Sweaters are very hard to actually get adjusted, but it is something when you get the right one, it is such a great piece. Now, look at the different styles out there. You're going to find some that have a mock neck crew, which it comes down right over here, just uses a few buttons, maybe a zipper. Those are great for throwing on, but what I really like are cardigans. What I love about it is the overall design of the cardigan and how it almost looks like a jacket. Next up, gentlemen, we've got gloves. Now, with gloves, a lot of guys think you need to match your overcoat, your P-coat, not exactly true. I look to the shoes. So, if you wear black shoes, go with black gloves. If you wear brown shoes, go with brown gloves. And you don't have to have an exact match here when it goes to the brown and you can straight it up. These right here, navy, I love them. You can also go with maybe a dark green. The key with gloves is making sure that they fit your hands and going with something that you know you're going to wear. Now, when it comes to mittens, I think mittens are perfectly fine if you're in an extremely cold area, but if this something is going to be less formal than nice finger gloves. Next up, gentlemen, let's talk trousers. So, I'm not going to bring up jeans in this video and I could have easily put them in this list, but I assume that you've already got some great fitted jeans in your wardrobe. What I want to talk about are trousers made from unique fabrics which I think work really well in the cooler weather. Number one, corduroy. So, corduroy is not just for kids, guys. Corduroy has two great things going for it. Number one are the whales and that's where it's got that unique weave that looks like texture because those whales in cooler weather actually can trap air and they're very warm. Again, perfect for winter wear. Now, also texture and so, texture I've talked about it before women love texture. Other men like texture, people want to touch texture. Now, what you see here is cavalry twill. This is a durable tough fabric. Literally, this stuff is going to be tougher than jeans. So, when you have this in your trousers, it's going to stand out, it's going to look unique. And most of all, guys, it's durable. This is something that's going to stand up to your washes, it's going to stand up to wear and tear and you're going to get a lot of miles out of it. Next up, gentlemen, we've got scarves and neck gaiters. The whole thing here is to keep the neck warm. Now, neck gaiters I think are great, but they're going to be very casual, but they do a great job of keeping the neck warm. Now, let's talk about scarves. So, scarves are great because you can bring color into an otherwise drab outfit. But if you're going to start off your base scarf, go with a gray, go with maybe something with a blue, I like something with a contrasting color, that's a great option right there. But bringing in a color in a pattern doesn't need to be bright, but actually bringing in something that draws attention brings a little bit of focus in on the face I think is great. Next up, pay attention to the material. The two scarves I just wore were a wool cashmere. This one is more of a cashmere and it's great, but it has a little bit more of an airy feel to it. Not going to be as warm as those other ones, but still very soft, very nice. And then, let's talk about silk options. These aren't going to add a whole lot of warmth, but what they are is going to protect my neck from the wind and they're going to bring in a lot of color. Now, if you're looking to level up your style, you really need to check out my free community over on school. I've set this community up, so we've got free classes that you can make your way through step by step and learn the basic foundations of men's style.

Go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. So, this next item may surprise a few of you guys, but I think a clean cut, well-fitted, dark colored hoodie is essential to a casual wardrobe. And let me explain. A lot of the hoodies out there being sold, they've got huge brand names on them or they've got just some crazy type of design on the back that makes them really loud or they're going in a color which is really impractical for tough wear. I think that the hoodie when you look at how basically functional it can be, it's great for layering. So, let's say you grab that P-coat, but you need something to give you a little bit of extra warmth up here or you can be wearing that jean jacket, you could throw the hoodie right underneath it. I think it's a great layering piece and when you get something that actually fits you and is functional as well, it's a great essential piece of a man's wardrobe. So, we're talking about your shoes drying out, guys, your hands and your face dry out as well. Basically, that cold weather is sucking the moisture out. So, you want to make sure to have little moisturizers right in the pocket of your jacket easy to grab so you can put it right in your hands, put it on your face as needed and lip balm is a must not only during the summer, but during the winter. Heavyweight winter socks. Wool is the tried and trusted option out there been around forever. The issue with wool though is it can be expensive and I know some of you guys have allergies to wool. So, look to synthetic materials in a performance weave. You're going to find these at sports stores. These do a great job of wicking away moisture and keeping your feet warm during the winter. Next up on the list for casual wardrobe essentials, guys, have a great jacket. I'm going to give you three options right here. This leather jacket I'm wearing right here, I absolutely love it. Makes me feel great, fits me like a glove. I love that small color distinction. Right there, it just sets it apart from all the other jackets out there. The styling is relatively simple, clean. It's a classic moto jacket, but perhaps that's too simple. You want something that's going to grab a little bit more attention with the texture. I got this chocolate suede right here. Beautiful classic jacket in a material that a lot of guys shy away from. But, with the jacket like this, you're looking for compliments. You're looking for a jacket when people see it, when the ladies see it, they're going to want to touch it. It just draws them in with the texture with the overall feel with the look. Notice the small details and the texture right there on the shoulders. These are put there to draw attention to the shoulders because when your shoulders look larger, you look taller in general. But, maybe chocolate's too plain. You want a color that's going to have you stand apart from the crowd. Now, a jacket like this maybe isn't going to be interchangeable, but it is one that's going to grab attention, one that's going to be able to help you stand apart from all the other guys out there. I think the key to wearing a colored suede jacket is having the confidence to pull it off. First up, look in your wardrobe. Are you already wearing items of that color? I know for me, sports jackets, I already had a couple green sports jackets. So, I knew this was one of my go-to colors that I would easily bring this right into my wardrobe. If you're going to wear a jacket with color, don't try to overpower it with other items in your wardrobe. This is going to be the centerpiece. So, don't try to wear shoes that are going to draw attention away from it. Shoes that are brighter in color, shoes that maybe have a high contrast. No, go with your simple, clean, good-looking shoes, but ones that, yeah, aren't going to draw as much attention as the jacket. With your trousers, keep them simple. With your shirt, keep it simple, keep it clean. You can go for a small repeating pattern, but overall, the jacket is going to be the centerpiece. And right here, as you can see, I'm wearing a double-breasted top coat made with a wool cashmere. And look right here at the design. That double-breasted right there is going to have it stand out from all the other jackets out there. It's a top coat, not an overcoat. A top coat is usually worn over more formal clothing. And you can tell that by the style of this jacket, although the color in my opinion does make this a bit more casual. Now, for me, what makes this jacket are these wide-peak lapels. On most jackets out there, you're going to see notch lapels. It's one style. Peak lapels, though, are going to be a bit more formal. Now, on occasion, you're also going to see shawl lapels out there especially in formal clothing. I would say stay away from it. What I like about this jacket even though it's a formal jacket, I could actually wear it and dress it down because of the color of the jacket itself. Also the fact it's made from a wool cashmere is going to make it very soft, very nice to the touch, and it's going to be very functional, very warm. Hence, why wool is always sought after in winter clothing. Lastly, notice the length of the jacket comes up just above the knees where a mid-length jacket should hit. It's going to fully cover the buttocks, so it's going to do a very functional job of keeping the wear warm. At the same time, it's probably not a great car coat, one that's going to enable you to get in and out of vehicles easily. But you know, for style's sakes, if you really like it, I would say still go for it. Now, this next jacket is interesting because it's a hybrid of different styles. First up, when you look at it, you look at the lapels, you look at the overall style, the double breasted in the front, you immediately may think P-coat. And because of those style features alone, I would actually classify this as a type of P-coat, but it's not a classic P-coat because the weight is relatively lightweight. Overall, this is a jacket that if you're over in Northern California, this would be a great one to add to your wardrobe. This is going to be something if it's 60 degrees, 50 degrees outside, you'll be able to wear it and feel good. It's also going to be a jacket that has a unique pattern. Classic P-coats are going to be solid navy. This one right here has a small check pattern that you don't actually \u2013 it's actually relatively large check pattern, but you don't notice it until you get close. It's muted overall in style and that's what I love about it. It's not until you get close that you notice something different about this jacket. Now, the length on this one is great especially if you're driving in a vehicle. Why? It's about three inches shorter than that last jacket, but that three inches makes a big difference. My buttocks is still covered, so it's going to keep me warm. At the same time, it's only going to my mid thigh, so it's going to give me more room when I'm getting in and out of a vehicle to be able to move my legs and not feel constricted. Now, the material here, virgin wool. Not as soft as wool cashmere, but incredibly soft and all that virgin means is it simply hasn't been recycled. So, you're going to have longer strand wool. It's going to do a good job of holding its shape and wool as you know has great insulating properties. I also like the functional aspect of this jacket and P-coats in general because I can button this button right here and I can protect my neck, throw on a scarf, I'm good to go. Now, what about the real thing? You bet a P-coat is going to make this list. I absolutely love the P-coat as a stylish coat for any guy out there. So, the great thing about this how incredibly functional it is, but also the military history behind the P-coat. In case you don't know, this was an issued item with the United States Navy. Also, I believe in the British Navy, you had this as well. Basically, navies around the world have used this for a long time, so there were a lot of them out there that were military issue. Nowadays, it's going to be a lot easier simply to find them at stores because it's become a style icon. The great thing about the P-coat, it's made from a little bit of a coarser heavier wool. What that means and why they used wool to begin with is wool can absorb about 50% to 60% of its weight in water and still actually feel dry. Keep the wear warm and that's why these were worn on boats, but when it comes down to it, this is just a great looking piece. I think it works with most body types, just a great style. One that I still think so many men could pull off, but they don't. And I absolutely love when you button it up all the way, cover the neck, you've got those lines, there's something about the look that my opinion is just classically stylish. The next jacket on my list, the straight up functional jacket. We're talking about a jacket that just does its job. It doesn't have to be flashy, it understands, okay, if it's just below zero and cold or if it's 40 degrees below zero and friggin' cold, you want a jacket that's going to keep you warm. So, number one job of your functional jacket is to keep you warm through insulation. Insulation works in two ways. First up, it's going to insulate you from the outside from those cold temperatures and then it's going to keep your body heat from escaping. Those two things right there are what makes a great functional jacket work. So, with this jacket right here, we see one of the usual suspects, wool on the outside. When woven in a dense weave, wool does a pretty good job of stopping the wind and does an excellent job of keeping out the cold and keeping the heat in. Now, on the inside of this jacket, that's where you get to see there's a second layer of down baffles. So, basically, they're leveraging the insulating power of down. Now, the reason they use the combination of down baffles on the inside and the wool on the outside is wool is just going to be hardier, it's going to be tougher, it'll be able to deal with the elements. Down on the other hand, if you get it wet, it's going to lose a lot of its insulating properties. Overall, a simple classic jacket that gets the job done and looks stylish doing it. Next up on the list of functional jackets, we've got the parka. The origins of this jacket is all about necessity, all about exploring, all about a man outworking in temperatures down to like 60 below zero. We're talking Native American tribes up near the Arctic, they needed to be able to hunt, they need to be able to functionally move around. At the same time, they needed something that would protect them from the extreme elements from the wind. On the outside to protect them from the snow, to protect them from the wind, they would use a waxed skin. On the inside, they would use the fur for insulation. Nowadays, most modern parkas are using synthetic materials. Right here on the inside, I've got a synthetic down. On the outside, I've got a synthetic polyester that's basically going to be water and wind resistant. You really want to pay attention to the wind resistance. This is where the parka really shines. It's not only does it cover a larger portion of the body than most jackets out there, but the outside is going to be made from material that isn't going to allow the wind to penetrate. In addition, the hood is going to do a great job of closing things up and protecting the neck. Parkas also pay attention to the small details because those small details matter. Right here on the front, I've got three closing systems. Why do you have two zippers and also buttons? Because you don't want any wind to penetrate, so it's going to do a good job of sealing the entire jacket up. In addition, right over here, even though this is a synthetic, it still does the old job of actually breaking up the wind in and around the face. When I've worn this at an extreme cold temperature, I do notice a difference. It just does a great job of keeping the air and I feel it keeps my face just a bit warmer. Combine that with big pockets down at the bottom and pockets a bit higher for your hands. The parka is the ultimate cold weather jacket. The next jacket every man needs to own is go-to default jacket. The jacket that you don't have to think about, you simply put on matches everything you wear. Now, for me, I've got a couple jackets that fit this category. This one right here is a quilted car coat. What I love about this, it's got big functional pockets. It's a dark color. It's got a hood that I've actually never pulled out, but it gets the job done. Whenever I'm leaving the house, it's sitting there hanging up and I just grab it. It's going to look great with jeans. I could actually throw, you know, a nice shirt underneath this. I could wear it with a t-shirt. I've even worn this thing with sweats, but that's pretty rare point being is I wear this jacket with pretty much anything. I like the way it looks. It dresses things up a bit, makes my whole outfit feel a bit more complete and living in an area that gets relatively cold weather for about half the year, this is a great just default jacket when it's below freezing but not cold enough to wear a parka. But, maybe you got a bit of a western flair to it, then go for the Sherpa jacket. I absolutely love this one. I think it's classic in style. It's got a bit of insulation, looks like a trucker, basically looks like a jean jacket from the outside, but it's got this extra layer on the inside. If you work with your hands, you got a hundred acres and you're going to be out there feeding the animals riding a horse, this is the kind of jacket that I envision a cowboy wearing simply because it gets the job done. You can wash it, throw it into the laundry, and overall it'll take a stain and it will keep going. So, overall, just a great functional work jacket. So, what if you want something casual, you want something lightweight, something you can pack away and not even know is there when you're not using it, check out the lightweight puffer jacket. One of my favorite jackets because it just gets the job done, doesn't have a big footprint, you can pack it away forget about it when you need to pull it out, it'll inflate itself, basically picks up air, creates the insulation that way. The only bad thing about these jackets if they get wet especially if they're using down, they will lose their insulating properties. But, that being said, they're a great layering piece. I know I've got this one whenever I'm just, again, I'm wearing my sweats if I'm going to go out for a jog, if I just simply I'm going to go for a walk with my wife, this is the jacket I'm going to default to. And occasionally to go to the grocery store to get pick up eggs and milk. Although, don't have to pick up eggs, I've got chickens, what am I talking about? And, of course, we can't forget the foundation of a man's wardrobe, his shoes. So, when it comes to dressing up especially during the colder months whenever the ground is a little bit more slick, you want to make sure especially on your shoes, your dress shoes that you've got a bit of traction. So, look for rubber soles or a mixture of leather with rubber right there on the front. I also like to go with shoes with a Goodyear welt. These are going to be more water resistant and basically that's the stitching where the bottom and the top have a can basically be resold. Now, if you're going to stick with sneakers, avoid the solid whites and avoid anything made from a canvas material especially when there's going to be rain, there's going to be slush, there's going to be snow on the ground. You want something that can get a little bit dirty and is easier to clean up. That's why I like leather and I like leather sneakers in a darker color. But my favorite footwear during the cold months boots especially boots that can deal with the elements that easily slip on and off work with my wardrobe. And, guys, if you want to see the ultimate video on how to find the perfect pair of boots, I go over 10 different styles, how to find the right style for you and buy it and get a great deal.

        "transcript": " Did you know 67% of men either buy their jeans too tight or too loose or even get a pair which they would never wear. Let's end the cycle today. Here's your foolproof guide to buying the perfect pair of jeans. Let's start things off by talking about fit. I've said this before and I'll say it again. Fit is king. When you have jeans that fit your body, you're going to feel and look good. But, what does proper fit mean? So, there's two things. There's the shape and the size of the jeans and then there's what you actually like on your body. You could have twins, exact same body types, put them in the exact pair of jeans and you may have one twin say, you know what, this is too tight on me, the other twins say, you know what, this is too loose on me, simply how they like their clothing to fit. And, when I'm talking about fit, I'm not just referring to the right size for your waist and the length of your legs. Rather, I'm talking about the cut of the jeans and how that enhances or detracts from your proportions. That means the best way to shop for fit is to focus on the right cut for your specific body type. Let's take a look at the five most common male body types and what type of jeans work best for each. First off, jeans for the thin man. This body type has a light build and a flat chest, small shoulders and lean muscles. The best jeans for this body type are slim or straight cut jeans. They flatter your slender without drawing too much attention to your undefined legs. And what type of jeans should a thin man avoid wearing? You want to skip the wide leg and baggy jeans. You're just going to look like you're swimming in them. And what about skinny jeans? In general, I like to avoid them, but if you're a skinny guy, if you really think they flatter your body type, then go for it. Next up, we've got the athletic man. Athletic men are defined with a slim waist, good muscle tone in the legs and buttocks. So, what jeans suit an athletic build? Well, this body type is pretty versatile and you've got options. You can wear slim jeans, straight jeans. The one style to avoid in my opinion are baggy jeans. I mean, come on, you spend time in the gym, eat right, you want to show off your build, right? Now, let's talk about the muscular man and the jeans that work for this body type. Believe it or not, this body type is one of the most difficult to buy jeans for. The issue here is you got a trim waist matched with large thighs and buttocks. In general, I will say we're going to get into the second part right here, comfort, that it is something that you find and you want to practice wearing clothing. Some people just simply like clothing that fits them a bit closer and I do think most men make the mistake when it comes to denim of not wearing jeans that fit them a bit closer. That being said, I get it. Some guys just really like loose jeans and if that's you, you know, just own it, go for it. But, look at the different styles. And this is key. Whenever you're looking at brands, you're looking at different companies out there, you want to make sure that they've got different fits. You definitely need to put the jeans on and you need to, yeah, do some squats, see how it fits in the crotch area, in the buttocks, in the legs. And, you know, this was farther down on levels of importance, but I think it's actually really important, try to have a bit of stretch in there. Why? This gives you just a lot more room. It's going to make them more comfortable especially when you wear the jeans a little bit closer. Stretching jeans is one of the best innovations I've seen in the last 20 years. Yes, it started off a little bit suspect, but now it has gotten really good, you know, 5%, 10% of stretch in those jeans is going to make a huge difference in the overall fit and feel. And when you're trying those jeans on, don't forget to look at yourself in the mirror, look at the backside, see how they make you look from behind. Yes, I know flattering look, a lot of guys ranked it kind of middle, not that important, but I think that's a lie. So many guys when they put on jeans, they want them to, I mean, come on, ladies, they look at that backside, they like the nice package, yeah. Put on jeans, they're going to get you compliments that are going to have her taking a second look. Now, let's talk about durability. A lot of guys think that when it comes to durability, all that matters is the thickness, the weight of the denim. To an extent, that is the most important factor, but there are many other ones you want to pay attention to. When I say weight of the denim, if you're not familiar, there are all different, you know, from basically 4 ounce to 16 ounce. Do you want to go with 16 ounce? No, I wouldn't recommend it because that is going to be so thick and so heavy of a material that it's not going to be comfortable. In fact, most denim out there you're going to see is about eight, maybe nine ounces. They have gone lighter over time. The original jeans, we go back 100 years. Those were the really heavy ones, but they were also incredibly uncomfortable. They took years to break in if they ever did. I think you're going to see some of that raw denim out there that's about 14 ounces. Point being is it really depends on what your needs are. As I was just talking with the sponsor, Dewar, what I love is that they've got different types, you know, for cold weather, they've got their warmer weather performance, lighter denim. And that's what I'm going to recommend. Look around for a company that actually has options for you and explains that because if you live like, you know, up north where it gets cold, you want to have something that's thicker, heavier, maybe with a slight little bit of fleece on the inside or something that uses something that's going to stop the wind or stop the rain from entering the denim and therefore, they'll be more functional for you. Now, that's another aspect a lot of guys were asking about on the denim is, hey, I want it functional. So, for denim to really be functional, it has to suit your needs. So, you need to understand, okay, am I going to be working in this denim and am I going to be constantly throwing the wash or am I going for something that I can wear? It's more of a fashion piece, something I'm not going to work on it too much. I'm going to be wearing it with a sports jacket. I do wear denim with a sports jacket. So, I know for me, I'm looking for something that fits well has actually, you know, not oversized features. I don't want a heavy boot cut wide at the bottom. I want something that's going to work with dress shoes, so the taper is going to go down. I also know that I want something a little bit closer. I want something that's going from a distance, it could almost be dress pants, but when they get up close, they're going to see it's denim. It's going to have a little bit of a difference. Function depends on what you need to get from the denim. If you're going to be working in it every day, if you're going to be painting in that denim, you probably want to go with the cheaper pair that you'll be able to throw out. You know, it's going to get torn up, you're going to get caught on nails and stuff working on ruse, maybe do blue collar construction. But, if you want something, again, that's going to be able to dress up, then you do want to spend a bit more money on it because this is going to be denim that's going to retain its color even when it goes through the wash. It's going to be denim that's simply going to look better. It's going to have a tighter weave. All of that is going to go into the play of the style and the overall durability you'll get from it. Next up, let's talk quality. So, quality is going to be different things to different people depending on what you need. But, let's say for a guy that, again, is blue collar working with his hands, for him, quality is going to be durability. It's going to be the number of stitches per inch on those seams that they've been reinforced so that when he goes into a squat position to be able to nail something down, the back of his pants don't just rip right open. That's the kind of stuff you want to pay attention to. And that's where I do see people being loyal to certain brands. Again, it's a price value, you know, that's where you got to measure it out. But, one of the areas that is really overlooked is the type of cotton that is used. So, cotton plant right here and then right here, this is the sliver. This is going to be the length of the cotton strand. Now, this is important in shirts and it's something that we pay attention to in dress shirts. Not so much in it's harder to track in denim when it comes to the materials, but you want to make sure in the higher end companies are going to use a little bit longer of a sliver. And that sliver is going to be then woven into a yarn. When it's longer like that, it's going to be stronger, it's going to be more durable, it's going to be able to deal with just additional pressure. The point here, if you're paying more for your denim, you want to pay attention to the fabric and the materials. And I always think a great indicator is that they are telling you why they choose what they do. Nothing wrong with putting a bit of stretch in there. Nothing wrong with putting a bit of elastic in and mixing it in with the cotton. If they explain what the percentages are and why they do what they do. Now, what about price? I know this one was actually number five on the list and I felt that that was high. Why? Well, yes, of course, we've all got a limited amount of money. But, you should look at actually the true value of the jeans, how many times you're going to wear them, how you're going to feel wearing them. In fact, I made this easy for you. Check out this value equation. Value is actually equal to the number of wears times the weight it makes you feel divided by the price. Gents, this point is so key. So many guys go out there and they buy something on sale, they buy something that's cheap and they don't like it, they don't like the way it makes them feel or the way it makes them look. So, they wear it maybe ten times. Yeah, you paid $25. So, what is that average $2.50 per wear versus a pair? Yes, they cost over $100. Let's say they cost $150. Well, guess what? You wear them 300 times. I mean, you just love those. You wear them until they have holes in them. The cost per wear was only 50 cents and you got a lot more value out of them. When it comes to denim, there are certain styles, there are certain fits that work better for different ages and different body types. You can wear any type of jeans at any age with any body type as long as you can fit into them. But, are they going to look good? That's what I'm trying to help you with. I want to make sure that you avoid some of the most common mistakes so that you look good. That being said, let's lay down some ground rules. Number one, jeans are casual. No such thing as dress jeans. Now, you can dress jeans up. You can wear them with a sports jacket. You can wear them with a blazer. I've seen guys wear the Texas tux with a tuxedo top, cowboy hat, and boots, but that doesn't mean that the jeans themselves are a dress piece. Understand that jeans are always going to make an outfit a bit more casual. Rule number two, denim becomes even more casual when it's lighter in color. Whenever it's distressed, whenever there are holes purposely put in there, I get it, they're fashion jeans, they are still ultra casual at this point. Rule number three, nail the right fit for your body type. So, this body type thing matters a lot more actually than age. Like I said, you can be an older guy, pull it off a younger style if you've got the body for it. But, if you're a younger guy and you don't have the body for it, that younger style, it's not going to look good. You want to make sure that you're wearing jeans that complement your build. Next up, we've got the rules on age. They're a lot looser and really it comes down to societal expectations. There are just certain expectations for older guys versus younger guys. Younger guys can experiment a lot more. That being said, if you've got the confidence, if you've got the clout and if you just simply don't care and you're an older guy, yeah, have fun and wear anything. Now, this next rule should be obvious, but when you're tucking your shirt into your jeans no matter what your age, you need to be wearing a belt. Gents, if you want to step up your style efficiently and effectively, look for a proven path. You see the waist and you see the inseam. Now, if those were the only two measurements that mattered, buying jeans would be easy, but there's a lot of other things you got to pay attention to. First up, know that the waist measurement is not a true waist measurement. 32 does not mean a 32-inch waist. In fact, this really depends on the style on the brand, but you'll see this it's a vanity measurement. Basically a 35-inch waist wears oftentimes a 32. Now, the inseam is a little bit more accurate, but it can be off as much of an inch. What you want to pay attention to, though, is the outseam and the rise. These are really important because a lot of guys don't think about this, but the height of the jeans, you're going to see a lot of low-rise jeans out there great for younger men, a little bit harder to wear for older guys. And if you're an older guy, maybe you want to go for something that's going to be mid-waisted. Higher waisted jeans, not for everybody, but if you don't have much of a butt or, you know, a little bit older, it could be the style that you're looking for. Last, but certainly not least, we've got the thigh measurements. Some a lot of guys don't think about, but very important if you don't skip leg day, you like to spend time squatting. Guess what? You want to make sure that you find a particular style that has more room right there in the thighs, in the buttocks area, so that you can fit into them and not tear them whenever you get down in that squat position. And let's not forget material. There are many different qualities of denim, but one thing that's pretty easy to spot is is it cotton or is it going to be made from a synthetic material or be a blend? I think blends are great. 100% cotton are perfectly fine. You never want to go for anything that's 100% synthetic, but the blend, why would you want to go for something like that? Because of the performance and the stretch. A lot of guys especially if you like something that fits a little bit closer, you want that stretch so you don't get any tight spots. Why would you want to go with 100% cotton? A lot of guys like it historically. This is what jeans were made from and if you're going to go for one of those higher end selvage type jeans, this is what you're shooting for. Now, let's get into the specifics. So, you're wondering, okay, I'm 21 years old Antonio, I'm a student and I want the best jeans for my body type. Well, here's the thing. If you're 21 years old and you're a student, you're probably in you're the leanest that you're ever going to be in your life. So, at this point, I'm not saying go skinny because that's going definitely out of fashion, but it is something that would work if you ever wanted to consider skinny. That being said, I think that slim cut jeans are going to be a great choice for you. Lots of great brands out there. Levi's, Uniqlo, H&M, and Old Navy if you're on a tight budget. Now, what about the loose jean trend? I'm not going to say go overboard here, but I am saying if you like that style, if you feel it's comfortable, if it works for you and even if you've got a leaner slimmer body build, go ahead and try it. This is the time as a young man as a student, you want to experiment at this point. You don't have to dress for your body shape at this age. You can dress more for your wants and simply just have fun to express yourself. When it comes to relaxed cuts, I know in Levi's you're going to have 541s, 550s, 559s, and 569s. Now, I do think that every man needs to have a pair of well-fitted dark denim. So, I'd say at least have that in your closet. But, if you've got that base piece, don't be afraid to get into experiment maybe with going something that's a bit faded, going with something that's a little bit of a different color, going something distressed, you can have fun again at your age and at this point. And if you really are tight on funds, go look in thrift stores, look at consignment shops, don't be afraid to grab used. It's one of the best ways, I think, to break free of trends because you stuff, you find something that maybe was a trend 30, 40, 50 years ago and you're able to get it for pennies on the doll. Next up, we've got the 36-year-old bad boy. You know, you're in the motorcycles, you like leather jackets and you really are just going for that look. You absolutely love it. So, in this case, I'm going to say stick with dark denim, black, dark blue, indigo. You could even maybe go for a dark green or gray. You're going for something here that's very functional because you're going to be getting in grease, you're going to be getting these things dirt. And you wear them for the function. You also want something that's going to be closer fitting so you can get on and off the motorcycle. Now, when it comes to a boot cut, you don't need to go for a full-on boot cut, but you can go for a boot cut. And I think it works because you're wearing oftentimes boots to protect your feet when you're on that bike. And, again, you want something that's going to also be heavier, something that can provide some protection from the road rash. Next up, I've got the 61-year-old Silver Fox. In fact, you look a lot younger than your age. You take care of yourself. You're a bit of a collector. You love your cars and you also mentor a number of younger guys around town as you build up your empire. At this point, I'm going to say have fun with your denim. As your hair starts to gray, as you start to age, your skin gets a little bit lighter. It doesn't always have the color it does. You can start to have fun with your denim. You can bring in colors like maybe a dark red. You can look at a brighter blue. There are just so many different options out there. Now, your testosterone levels have most likely dropped a bit from when you were in your 20s. Yes, I know. Hard to believe, but it is something that will affect the shape of your muscles in your legs. So, your buttocks may be a little bit smaller. This is something you want to stay away from those low-waisted jeans. You want to go for something that's at least a mid-waist, maybe even a little bit higher-waist, something that fits well on your body type. Now, when it comes to brands, Levis is always a great option, but if you've got a bit more money to spend, look at AG, an amazing company for guys over the age of 50 and maybe even look over at APC. Now, what about for the 26-year-old gym shark? You know what I'm talking about. You spend your nights and your mornings in the gym. You're putting on the weight you love investing in your body, and it shows. But, those thighs, they make it very difficult to find a pair of jeans that actually fits you in the waist and in the leg area because every time you put on a pair of jeans that fits you in the leg area, you've got like five inches of extra room right there in the waist. So, what do you do about this? Well, you could take it to a tailor to get it adjusted or you could find a style that fits your body type. So, starting off with Levis, you got 501s, you have 508s, and 541s oftentimes work very well for athletic men. Wrangler makes an advanced comfort fit you should check out. If you're over at Old Navy, check out their athletic fit jeans. Mid-tier, we've got Lucky Brand 410 Athletics. Also, check out their 363 vintage straights. Next up, we've got the 41-year-old professional man. You want to be able to dress those jeans up. You want something you can wear into the office at the same time that you can leave the jacket at home and you can just simply go out with your kids on the weekend. The key with your jeans here is going to be simplicity. You want to go with that dark blue, that indigo. You could also go with black, but in order for it to work with a number of things in your wardrobe, you want to keep it simple. You want to keep it plain. You want to make sure you don't go for anything outlandish. When it comes to the fit, just don't go with extremes. Don't go with a really super relaxed fit. Don't go with a tight skinny fit. Instead, slim fit, that works for your body profile. If you're a little bit heavier, you're putting on a little bit weight, maybe go for that looser fit by 59s on Levis or you could go right over to the straight cut, which I think is great especially if you got maybe 10 to 15 pounds extra around the midsection. The straight cut is still going to look good. That being said, I still lean towards tapered cuts. And the reason being is it's going to work with shoes, dress shoes in particular, but even sneakers. Again, the straight cuts, the looser cuts, they can work with that, but I just feel it's a little bit too much excess material down at the bottom. But if you wear boots, if you've got shoes a little bit larger and you decide to dress them up that way, it can work. Now, as mentioned, Levis makes a wide variety of those styles, but if you want something a little bit more affordable, check out Leigh. I think Wrangler is going to be a little bit too casual, but you can't find some options over there. But, Anna Republic actually has some pretty good jeans and I like that they have a little bit of stretch on them as well. Gap is going to be a little bit more affordable, not as great a quality, but they'll get the job done. Uniclo seems to always do things right. And if you've got a store next to you, it's worth checking them out. And if you've got a bit of a budget, check out APC, AG, or naked and famous. All right, guys. So, what video to watch next? How about dress shoes and jeans? How to pair them, how to style them, how to make it work? In this video, I cover exactly how. So, that you don't go out there and make some style. Yeah, you don't want to make the style mistakes. Guys, check out this video. I make it simple for you. Yeah, click on it. Boom, right there. Yeah, go check it out."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, have you ever wondered how some guys look just so damn sharp? What do they know that you don't? What you're seeing is the Pareto principle, the 80-20 rule. 20% of your effort yields you 80% of your return. Basically, it's the right details that count, the little things that you maybe wouldn't even notice that add up and make a huge difference. I'm sharing with you the seven stylish secrets that all men need to know to be able to take their outfit from okay to next level awesome. First up on the list, shoe grips. Leather dress shoes are a must, a foundation from which you can build your entire wardrobe. Really, gents, don't waste your money on cheap shoes. That being said, leather soles can be troublesome. Sure, they're a sign of expensive, well-made shoes, but the reality is as soon as it starts to rain, as soon as you step on some snow or sleet, you are going to slip and fall on your backside. So, how to get some traction on those leather soles without having to have the whole shoe rebuilt? The solution? Shoe grips. Shoe grips are made from rubber. They attach to the bottom of your shoe using an adhesive and sometimes tax. Now, the great thing about quality shoe grips is that they're so thin, they're not going to affect the way you walk, the profile of the shoe, and if you put them in the right spots, they can also slow down the wearing away of the bottom of the sole. And most important, you won't be slipping and falling on your backside. Next up, we've got the gray undershirt. So, the undershirt is an essential tool for any well-dressed man. It helps to get rid of sweat stains and it helps keep you warm. Now, undershirts are supposed to be invisible to the naked eye. Now, you might think a white undershirt is hidden under a white dress shirt. Well, gents, if this is what you think, you are wrong. Seriously, try it. Go look in a mirror. It's more obvious than you think. So, how to fix this problem? Gents, go with a gray or nude colored undershirt. Gray or nude colored undershirts are oftentimes a closer match to your skin tone than white. For the vast majority of men, gray or nude is going to be better because it's going to allow the undershirt to remain invisible under your white dress shirt. Next up on our list, the button extender. Here's the situation. You've got to wear a necktie, wedding, interview, whatever it may be, you have not worn a necktie for a while. So, you grab your trusty white shirt, you button it up all the way to the collar except you can't. Somehow, over the last year, this shirt's collar has gotten smaller. Now, maybe you've gained 5, 10, 15, 20 pounds, but come on, not in the neck. You can't button the collar. This is your only shirt and you need to wear a necktie with it. What do you do? The solution? The button extender. This secret device gives you an extra three-quarters of an inch to help bridge the gap between your top button and the buttonhole, giving you that much needed breathing room. And, of course, it remains hidden behind the necktie. And, in case you don't have a button extender, another quick hack is to pop off that top button and re-sew it on a quarter to half an inch moved over so you got a little bit more room. Next up, we've got the tie bar. So, I don't know about you guys, but I find it incredibly annoying when my necktie wants to go off and do its own thing. It's getting blown with the wind, it's dipping into my soup, so how to keep an unruly necktie under control and add a bit of style to your outfit? The solution is the tie bar. This classic men's accessory clips your tie to your dress shirt keeping it in place all day long. In general, the tie bar should be about 75% the width of your necktie. Give or take 15%. If you drop below 50% of the width of your tie, it just looks a little bit odd, it looks too small. If it goes beyond the width of your tie, yeah, just not a good look, it looks way too big. Fasten the tie bar between the third and fourth button on your dress shirt. Placing the tie bar too high makes it ineffective. Placing the tie bar too low, well, nobody can see it. Next up, shirt stays. Putting an untucked dress shirt, guys, this screams one thing, slob. In the morning, you get dressed, tuck in your shirt, but as the day goes on, it works itself free. So, you tuck it back in and then repeat 1,000 times throughout the day. So, frustrating. So, what's the solution? Two words, shirt stays. I first learned about shirt stays while I was serving in the United States Marine Corps. We wore them with our dress uniforms and they were a secret weapon to keep your shirt tucked in all day. Now, shirt stays are made from an elastic strap with clips on each end. You usually have two clips that attach to the bottom of your dress shirt and then the other end attaches to the top of your sock. And once you put on your trousers, no one would even know. The constant tension from the elastic part keeps the shirt tucked in by pulling the shirt down and pulling your socks up. Now, the only way this is ever uncomfortable is if you make the rookie mistake of having too much tension. Too much tension and they can snap off, ouch, and too little and, yeah, they're just not going to be effective. And besides keeping the shirt tucked in all day and your socks up, the tension from the stays also keeps the lines of your shirts straight all day long. Next up, we've got the micro adjust belt. Belts have been a men wear staple for over a thousand years. Today, the most common style are belts that use holes that latch with a buckle. But to be honest, gents, this belt style, yeah, it's outdated and in my opinion sucks. The holes are about an inch apart. So if you find yourself between holes, you're stuck with a belt that's too tight or too loose. In addition, the buckle puts a lot of tension on the leather strap at this point leaving indentions increases. The result is you get a very unsightly looking belt strap especially if you move to a different hole later on. So, how to solve this problem? Enter the micro adjust belt. This belt system skips holes entirely. Instead, it uses a track system that can adjust down to a quarter of an inch. The beauty of this system, you now have a belt that will fit you perfectly. And if you have a big lunch or you go on a diet for a week and lose a couple pounds, guess what? You can adjust the belt no problem and it looks good. The reason for this is on the micro adjust belt, the tension is on the track of the backside. There is intention applied to the front of the strap like on a traditional belt. The result, you've got a belt that fits you better and looks great even months after wearing. No unsightly creases or indentions. Gen. The slick collar. I love to wear a dress shirt without a tie. The problem is that your shirt collar without a necktie oftentimes falls over. It sags, it looks crumpled. And this look gets even worse when you wear a jacket and the collar falls underneath it. Why does this happen? Well, historically dress shirts were made to be fully buttoned up with a necktie. As such, collars especially cheap ones are like jellyfish. They have no internal structure. They have no bones to keep them up. So what to do? How to get a shirt collar that stands up straight and looks amazing? Well, one solution I found is slick collar. Slick collar is a lightweight adjustable device that fits right underneath your shirt collar. It gives your collar structure, it stays hidden, and once installed you don't even notice it's there. The result is a collar that looks great, stands tall, and that you don't have to worry about slipping underneath your jacket. And with that being said, gents, continue the viewing experience. Seriously, check out this video right here. If you enjoy these videos here at Roman Real Style, you are going to love this one. Seriously, you're going to watch this video, you're going to fall in love. You're not going to be able to leave YouTube and not seriously. Good video, guys. Check it out right here. Oh, yeah. Come on. Boom. Right there."

        "transcript": " So, when matching a shirt with a sweater, a mistake that you want to avoid is overdoing it when it comes to color and pattern. Now, as you can see in this example right here, we've got all types of patterns in the sweater and all types of patterns in the shirt. And, Jen, straight up, it's just too much. Now, the simple guideline I like to lay out is if you're going to have a pattern in your sweater, go with a solid colored shirt. If you're going to have a pattern in your shirt, go with a solid colored sweater. Now, the rules when it comes to color are a little bit more nuanced. A monochromatic look, meaning the shirt color and sweater are similar in color. Well, these uniform shades being right next to each other whether they're light or dark overall look good although I think most complexions if they're going to do this are suited towards darker colors, but the best color combinations are usually going to be higher contrast mixes. As for if we've got that lighter colored shirt usually white mixed in with that darker colored sweater or vice versa. And the reason this contrast works is it makes the layering more pronounced, more visible. Now, speaking of layering, you got to make sure that both your shirt and the sweater fits you well. Yeah, nothing ruins this combination more than wearing an oversized sweater or a shirt that's too big that creates a messy rumbled look. Now, this next mistake I assume that you're not making it, but just in case you're that guy that doesn't know the shirt that you're wearing underneath your sweater, you tuck that in. And no, don't go for the half tuck. I know you saw it in a movie one time you thought it would look cool. Yeah, maybe Brad Pitt or Austin Butler can pull it off, but for the rest of us mere mortals, we need to tuck it in our shirts. And on the flip side, don't tuck in your sweater. Now, if a sweater is too short, hopefully you're not going to buy it or wear it. But what if that sweater is a bit long? Well, thankfully, the majority of sweaters have an elastic band which you can fold up and tuck underneath. But, yeah, don't be tucking in your sweater. But if you want to wear a shirt and sweater, how exactly should you do it? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video, How to Match a Shirt and Sweater Correctly. You ready, gents? Let's do this. Now, really quick, one of the mistakes I almost forgot, your shirt collar falling underneath the sweater. So, I'm talking about you're layering with a polo, it's got a soft collar and it falls right underneath. Or you've got an oversized dress shirt that's pillowing underneath and has an oversized collar that's folding in on itself. Gents, if you're looking for a collar shirt that was specifically designed to be able to be layered easily, look, no further than today's sponsor, Collars & Co. Collars & Co was on Shark Tank. They got Mark Cuban to invest a million dollars because he saw the opportunity and the problem that they were solving. So many guys are tired of uncomfortable ill-fitted dress shirts when they try to layer, yet if you use a polo, it's got that weak collar that just falls underneath your sweater. Well, guess what? Collars & Co solved the problem by coming out with the dress collar polo. Their first product, this is a polo shirt with a dress collar, placket and collar. Now, all of their dress collar polos are made from a performance fabric with a four-way stretch that wicks away moisture. The fabric is soft to the touch, incredibly lightweight, and they've got them in all different colors, all different patterns. They've actually got a wide range of collar styles whether you want a semi-spread collar or an English spread collar button down or a cutaway. But what I love about this company is they didn't rest. They actually came out with a whole line of sweaters. Yeah, if you're looking for a knitwear to be able to wear with your dress collar polo, they've got you covered with a wide variety of quarter-zipped sweaters as you can see right here in various colors. And these sweaters right here, they're vineyard waffles are made from 100% cotton which makes them incredibly easy to take care of and durable. And in case you're wondering, the sweater I'm wearing right here is the Kenna Bunkport sweater which is a bit more casual with these larger buttons right here. And I'm also going to highly recommend the Maverick Blazer. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about a performance blazer, but as soon as I put this on, the fit was spot on. And I love the stretch fabric, the built-in pocket square, and the overall luxury feel yet functional design. And the fact that it's wrinkle resistant when I'm traveling, this is the jacket I'm now grabbing. So, go check them out. Collars & Co. An awesome innovative company. I love what they're doing and, yeah, use that link to get the best deal on the web. Now, gents, this video is an ultimate guide and I'm going to break it into three parts. First, I'm going to talk about all the different sweater styles. I'm going to talk about the different shirt styles. And then, I'm going to talk about the formula for mixing and matching. Now, overall, I think this is pretty simple. But if you have any questions, know down in the description of today's video, I'm going to link over to the infographics to the images and additional support articles that will break this out if you want to read through it or if you would rather learn from visuals. And so, without further ado, let's get into sweater types. First up, we've got the classic crewneck sweater. Defined by its rounded high neckline, this sweater comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns. That being said, if you're building your wardrobe, if you're buying your first crewneck sweater, I would highly recommend you go with a neutral color. A shade of gray, navy, or perhaps a dark solid brown, dark green, or even black. The goal here is to choose a color that's going to be interchangeable and it's going to work with the rest of your wardrobe. Now, the next sweater style, again, defined by its neckline is going to be the v-neck. This sweater pretty much comes in all the same colors and patterns as the crewneck, although I do find because this is a common layering sweater, it's often going to be in a solid neutral color. And as I mentioned, this is one of the easiest sweaters to add to your wardrobe if you want to be able to wear a dress shirt underneath, possibly layer this sweater with a sports jacket and the v-neck because of its shape does an excellent job of showing off a neck tie if you're wearing that with your dress shirt. The next sweater is the classic cardigan. Now, this is an open front sweater. Traditionally, it had buttons, but you're also going to see zipped cardigans out there. And unlike a sweater jacket, it doesn't have a lapel and usually has patch pockets. Now, sweater jackets, as I just mentioned, usually have a lapel and sometimes have what are known as vetted pockets. Vented pockets actually go into the garment versus patch pockets are sewn on top. Patch pockets especially on a cardigan are going to be more casual. The vented pockets on a sweater jacket are going to be a little bit more formal. Next up, we've got the quarter zip. This is going to be more of a modern classic especially because we're talking about zippers, although you will see buttons on this and I'm going to lump them together. Because I think a little bit more classic and if the buttons are smaller, I think it's a little bit more formal. Zippers because of their casual nature are going to make the garment overall just, yeah, more casual. That being said, a lot of companies pay attention to those small details. I know they put a suede lining around the edge of the zipper and they use a clean zipper design which overall I think makes the outfit look good. Which in today's day and age, if it's cold outside, I think you could even wear this with a suit. Next up, let's talk about the classic turtleneck. Now, a classic turtleneck is going to have a longer neck that needs to be folded. Now, occasionally, you're going to see mock turtlenecks. These look like a turtleneck, but there is no fold required. Next up, we've got sweater vests. We're going to see this with both the zippers and buttons. The button vests are going to be more formal. And depending on the design and the thickness, the formality of this can go either way, but in general, sweater vests are actually made to be layered with a suit to help insulate and provide a bit of warmth. They're a very smart option because they don't add a whole lot of bulk, yet they add a whole lot of warmth. Next up, we've got the polo sweater. And this one's unique because it is the only sweater type that has its own built-in collar. Now, polo sweaters because they are knitwear are going to have a soft collar. And when it comes to layering, I need to be clear, a polo sweater should not be worn with a shirt that has a collar. No, that's just redundant. Yes, you can wear an undershirt or a crew neck t-shirt underneath, but, yeah, polo sweaters, you shouldn't see the layering underneath them. Now, at this point, let's get into some of the more casual styles out there. So, cable knit sweaters. Now, the cable knit is referring to the pattern into the weave, not so much the collar type. And you will see, you know, turtlenecks out there that have a cable knit weave. But, understand, in general, cable knit sweaters are going to be a bit more casual. They're also going to be thicker. They're also going to be heavier, which actually makes them great to be able to wear on their own, not necessarily with a jacket on top. And speaking of sweaters, they're made to be worn as an outer piece, not under a jacket. Let's talk about those heavy chunky knit sweaters you're going to see out there. These sweaters are usually going to use a thicker yarn. They're going to have what appears to be a more textured appearance. And when you feel them, you touch them, you are really going to be able to tell that this is a heavier weight sweater. A lot of Aaron sweaters are going to fit into this category, which they're also classified as cable knits. Fisherman or Gurney sweaters are also going to fit into this category, which, by the way, the distinctive feature of that sweater is it doesn't have a front or a back. It can actually be worn either way. But, yeah, similar to cable knit, chunky knit sweaters are going to come in a variety of neck types and it more refers to the thickness and the weight of the garment. Now, what about Fair Isle? What about Norwegian? What about these patterned sweaters you're going to see out there? Similar to the other sweaters we talked about, these are going to be casual and they're often made to be worn as outerwear. But, of course, if you're going outside, it's inclement. Whether you definitely want to throw a shell on to be able to protect you from the wind, but these are going to be thicker, heavier, insulating sweaters that are leveraging distinctive patterns that have cultural significance. All right. So, now, let's talk about the shirt types. First up, we've got the undershirt. But, an undershirt nowadays usually made to fit the body a bit closer. Made from a lightweight material, it'll come in a crew neck or a v-neck. And sometimes, I know I personally prefer this a deep v-neck so that you don't see it underneath. But, yeah, undershirts are designed to actually protect your outerwear from the sweat and debris that actually comes off of your own body. They also provide a little bit of insulation. If you get cold easily, you nip out, you don't want everyone seeing that, yeah, you can even wear them under a t-shirt. Which is our next garment. So, the classic t-shirt really doesn't need an introduction. You've got both v-necks and regular crew neck t-shirts. But a t-shirt is nothing more than an evolved undershirt. Made nowadays to be worn as outerwear. And depending on the brand, the material, the thickness, t-shirts come in a wide variety of styles, different looks. You can have patterns from graphic tees to lightweight solids to heavier weight solids. Now, step it up a bit in formality just simply because we've got that opening in the front with a few buttons, we've got the classic Henley. Now, the Henley design has been around for over 150 years. I really like them. I think they're an underused garment in menswear and I especially like them when they're long sleeve. And I know for me, it's a go-to staple during the winter. Now, if we were to add a color to that Henley, all of a sudden, we've got the polo. Now, the classic polo shirt as most of us know it is going to be shorter sleeve. You do have longer sleeve polos out there and you've got even thicker heavier weight polo shirts, but the key distinct feature for most people with a polo is going to be that soft collar. Now, at this point, let's get into casual button downs. So, casual button downs are going to have a full opening front, but they're usually going to be made and cut in a way and from a fabric that makes them more casual than a dress shirt. So, shirts in this category are going to be made from chambray. You're also going to see linen shirts fall into this category, casual button down linens. You're also going to see flannels and flannels especially during this time of the year during the colder season, I think are a great option. And the reason being is that flannel fabric is a napped fabric meaning that it's been treated and there's little hairs, there's little bits of yarn that come off. That right there provides a softness and an insulation layer, so it actually makes them warmer than a flat-lang fabric like a twill. Now, stepping things up a bit in formality, but not yet a dress shirt, let's go to the Oxford cloth button down. Now, with Oxford cloth, you don't always have to have a button down collar, but that's one of the distinctive features a lot of people when they're looking for a classic Oxford shirt. They ask for the button down collar because this was made popular on the Northeast. The whole Ivy League style, but this particular shirt is casual even though it may look a bit formal because of that collar and because of the weave of this fabric. So, Oxford fabric is a basket weave. What's interesting a lot of the color fabrics is that the horizontal thread and the vertical thread are occasionally dyed a different color. From distance, this gives a softer pastel type color look to the fabric, but when you get in close, you can see the texture, you can see the thickness, and overall this fabric is very hard wearing, which takes us then to the highest level of shirts we have out there, dress shirts. Now, most dress shirts we're going to see out there are made from a poplin weave. This is going to be using a very thin yarn with a very tight weave that gives the shirt a lightweight luxurious feel. Occasionally, you can see dress shirts out there using a twill weave, which is a very tough durable weave, but slightly less dressy than poplin because it has a distinctive arrow-like pattern, which if it's a true solid can only be seen up close. And I have to admit, I do like twill fabrics because I think they're a little bit warmer during the winter. And really quick with dress shirts, historically, they should be in a lighter color. They can come in a variety of stripes occasionally a check, but this does make the shirt much more casual. All right, so now you're aware you've got all these options, but how to pair them together? What's the formula? Well, the first step to properly matching a shirt with a sweater is to match the formality. So, all of our dress shirts are going to pair really well with any of our v-neck or crewneck sweaters that have a thin lightweight weave and are in a neutral color. D-necks, cardigans, sweater jackets, sweater vests, all of these are going to pair with dress shirts. Now, taking this a step down talking about our flannel shirts, our chambray shirts, our oxfords and maybe even some of our polos, these are going to be the shirts you're going to wear with the more casual sweaters. So, our crewnecks and the variety of different quarter zips to include those quarter zips that also have buttons which some people do call a Henley style sweater. Now, understand that this is just a starting point and when it comes to versatility, I do believe that dress shirts have a lot of range here. I've seen people wear white dress shirts with pretty much the range of all the sweaters I've talked about so far especially when you're wearing a necktie. This can go with a cardigan, this can go with a quarter zip. A combination looks great with a sweater jacket. And remember, one of the garments has a strong pattern. So, if you choose a flannel shirt with a distinctive check in it, make sure you're pairing it with a sweater like a quarter zip that's solid that's going to allow the shirt to basically stand in the limelight. Right with that, if you decide to go with a sweater that has a bold pattern, oftentimes you're going to see sweaters, they've got stripes just going straight across. In that case, just try to choose a shirt that blends in not something that has high contrast, something that maybe complements the dominant color in the sweater that, yeah, just adds structure to the neck but doesn't try to draw from the attention the sweater is commanding. All right. So, now, let's put this into practice. The first combination we see right here we've got a crew neck with a classic dress shirt. And you can choose to wear this with a tie or without, but you want to ensure the shirt color peaks slightly above the sweater neckline. This right here is a timeless look for business casual. Next up, we've got the v-neck with dress shirt and a necktie. Now, what I love about this combination, what makes it work really well is you've got three different fabric materials. You've got the wool of the sweater mixed with the cotton of the shirt and the silk of the necktie. And even though only a small portion of the tie can be seen, we know that you're wearing it so the overall formality of the outfit has stepped up. Now, this combination right here you can wear it on its own or you can layer a sports jacket or wear this with a suit combination. Next up, we've got a cardigan with a t-shirt. I know I said you got to stick with the formalities, but here's what I want to stress, gentlemen. Once you know the rules, you have the power and my permission to go out there and break them. Now, of course, you got to be confident in this look and I would highly recommend a t-shirt that is a high quality, well-fitted t-shirt and it also helps you've got a good build. But, yeah, this monochromatic look right here works especially if you're just going out with your partner on the weekend. Next up, we've got the quarter zip and a chambray shirt. So, a lot of people when they see chambray, they think denim, but it's lighter weight and it usually has a lighter weave, but chambray is beautiful. I actually love this fabric and what's nice about this combination right here is you've got the roughness of the shirt mixed in with the elegance of that quarter zip and, yeah, this combination just works. So, what about the fair isle sweater? Well, in this case, underneath and we're not going to see it, you're probably wearing a t-shirt, an undershirt, or maybe a henling. But, with these combinations where the shirt's hidden, the sweater is taking front and center attention and let it do that by wearing maybe some indigo dark colored jeans, a pair of gray flannel trousers, or maybe a dark brown corduroy. Your footwear, keep it casual, a little bit dressed up, maybe some suede desert boots or a pair of lace dress boots maybe with a bit of broguing on them, or perhaps keeping it super simple and versatile with a pair of black colored chukkas. Now, when it comes to turtlenecks, I love seeing a guy wear that with a jacket, a sports jacket, a blazer even wearing it with a casual suit. But, even if you're going casual like with an errand sweater, look at this sleek green safari or maybe even a fatigue jacket on top. All right, gents, so hopefully you got value, but if that was too much like Antonio, man, I am a lazy guy. Make it simple. Well, guys, I got you covered with this video right here, the lazy man's guy to casual style. Boom. Right here, I got you covered. If you want it easy, casual style, boom, right here. Oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " So, the first step in leveling up your style dressing like an elite man is to stop making the mistakes that sabotage your look. First up, if your clothing is too tight, if it's too loose, if it's an improper length whether it be your sleeves or the length of your trousers, gents wearing clothing that doesn't fit will instantly sink your style. Next up, let's talk about those scuffed, unpolished worn out shoes. If you're wearing the wrong shoes with the wrong outfit with the wrong level of formality, gents your footwear is the foundation of your style. If you fail to get this right, it can kill your image instantly. Huge logos, flashy clothing that screams the brand's name, gents if you're not getting paid by that brand to advertise, then understand that you sporting that huge logo does nothing but diminish your style. Super skinny jeans, baggy oversized jackets, loud in your face trendy patterns and colors. Gents, if you're looking to sport a top 1% look, for most of us it's not going to be found in fast fashion. Low quality accessories, over accessorizing, mismatching your colors and patterns, ignoring seasonal adjustments and not paying attention to the context of what you're dressing for. So, those are the mistakes to avoid. But how do you actually dress if you want to look like an elite man? Step by step, how does a man develop timeless style? Well, gentlemen, that is the subject of today's video. So the first step to dressing like a top 1% man is to adopt the mindset of a timelessly stylish man. So the key principles are minimalism over flash. You want to avoid ostentatious designs, style for you is really about timeless pieces in subtle detail. Next up, it's always quality over quantity. You understand style isn't about having super expensive clothing or having a lot of it. Instead, it's about high quality items that are relatively interchangeable with the other pieces in your wardrobe. Therefore, you can own less, mix and match the items with the result being plenty of timelessly stylish outfits. Next up, you're all about timelessness not trends. Now, a well-dressed man has nothing against fashion. But when it comes to timeless style, you realize this isn't boring. Yeah, some of these items have been around for over 30, 50, 100 years, but that's what makes them great. They're not going to go out of style anytime soon. And because of that, you could spend more money on individual pieces and buy quality. Last but not least, a man that has timeless style dresses for himself. By that, I mean he understands that his clothing is a tool. It's a representation of how he sees himself, how he respects himself. A timelessly stylish man understands that people are biased, that all of us are human and that we judge others based off of what we see, the vast majority of the time. Yeah, it's shallow, but reality. And a timelessly stylish man uses that to his advantage by wearing clothing that sends the message he wants to send. The next step to dressing like a top 1% man, classic timeless style relies on routines, not reactions. So, a man with elite style, he's not reactive when it comes to getting dressed. What I mean by that in general, he doesn't wake up late, he doesn't go into his closet not knowing what he's going to wear. He doesn't haphazardly shower, groom, and get dressed. No, a top 1% man has a routine. He's got a ritual to the way he does things. The details of when he wakes up, the routine of the order of how he showers, shaves, and grooms himself to the way the clothing he's going to wear is already laid out the night before. Now, I get it, to some of you guys this may sound like overkill, it may sound like a lot of work. But, if you understand the science of decision fatigue, you know then that there's little bit of planning. These routines of cutting your nails, trimming your body hair in a routine fashion, same day of the week approximately same time, what this does is it frees up mental bandwidth. It allows you to create simple habits which systematically level up your style. Example, let's say you want fuller better looking hair. Well, then, in the morning, right out of the shower, you want to start using a hairdryer. Seriously, adding this two-minute action to your morning routine can help you style your hair in a way that looks good and gives your hair more body. And, gents, if you're in the market for a hairdryer, you want to check out today's sponsor Lyfan. Now, the high-speed hairdryer that I'm holding right here is the Lyfan SE. Now, gents, for over two years, I've been using Lyfan high-speed hairdryers because first up, I love them because they are incredibly powerful. Seriously, I got this brushless motor over 100,000 rpms which basically means it's a lot more airflow than average hairdryer, so it dries your hair two to three times faster. In addition, it's quiet. We got seven kids in the house. I got a two-year-old. You got to keep things quiet. And that's why I love this hairdryer because my daughter's using it as well and nobody wakes up the baby when they're using the hairdryer. They got this hot and cold circle mode that protects your hair and scalp from heat damage. They've also got this four-temperature light ring so you can go with cold, you can go with warm, you can go with hot. And if you press and hold the button, you'll be able to activate the circulating mode in which it goes from cold to hot automatically. The Lyfan SE also comes with these magnetic attachments. As you can see here, attach easily on and off. So, gents, check out the Lyfan SE. This is the best hairdryer on the market, bar none. And then, make sure you get the best deal on the web. Use that link in the description of today's video. So, again, gents, use that link go over to Lyfan, make sure you get the best deal on the web when it comes to the Lyfan SE. So, the next step to dressing like the top 1% is to be inspired and to imitate. So, a lot of guys get confused when it comes to style because they think that they have to be 100% original. And they're mild when developing their style, they feel it needs to be 100% unique, which if you think about it is a lot of work and 100% unnecessary. No, gents, make it easy. Find somebody, find a look that you absolutely love and then imitate it, making it yours. Maybe find an actor, an Instagram influencer whose style you resonate with and straight up copy it because the reality is you're never going to exactly copy it and everyone that sees you they're going to think it's your look. They're not going to know that you took that look from Tom Hardy, Brad Pitt, Michael B. Jordan, or whatever online influencer you were impacted by. But, gents, having that inspiration and then working to imitate it, this is your direction when you're out there trying to figure things out when you're looking to piece items together and it's going to help ensure you get the look, you get the outfits that you're shooting for. So, this next step is getting into the specifics. Let's talk about building the foundation of your wardrobe, your footwear. Oxford, Derby's, Chelsea Boots, Lofors, Dress Boots, Casual Boots, Leather Sneakers. Now, your choice here really depends on the image you want to imitate, the uniform you're trying to put together, the style that you're trying to capture. Now, in general, we're talking elite styles. Most of these are going to be a little bit more formal. That's where you're going to see suits, you're going to see sports jackets, blazers. However, you can put together casual looks that scream silent luxury. I think that show billion did a really good job of showing how casual clothing can still really have an elegant timeless look to it. But, the foundation of all this is the right footwear and making sure that footwear is in good condition and taking care of especially in between wears. If you're going to go for white sneakers, then keep them white. The next step is building up your wardrobe. Now, we've talked about interchangeability. In previous videos, we've talked about specific colors. And, by the way, if you want specific color advice, I will link to that video down in the description. But, in general, when it comes to a man's wardrobe, we're going to have three items, trousers, shirts, and jackets. Now, your pants, aka your trousers, are an item a lot of guys don't think much about which makes sense because they're usually a base layer. They're the canvas in which the other items sit on. However, the quality of your canvas makes a big difference. Now, a lot of guys they're going to default to denim, maybe a dark indigo, or maybe they're going to go with a pair of cotton chinos, which nothing wrong with those two pieces are classics. But, if you want to dress it up a bit, if you want to look like top 1%, then consider bringing in some wool trousers. A flanneling gray or charcoal is not only going to be more elegant, but as the fact that gray is a non-color, it's going to match pretty much anything. Other trousers a man may want to consider are going to be cavalry twill or if you can find it, moleskin. And, if you like chinos and you like cotton, maybe go for a darker color. Now, when it comes to shirts, again, this is going to depend on who you're being inspired by. If you're going for a more casual look, let's say the pants you chose were actually dark color joggers, then in that case a solid color crew t-shirt or v-neck t-shirt is going to work. If you want something a little bit more stylish, consider a Henley, the buttons right there on the front just seem to level it up one step above a t-shirt. However, for most guys if they're going for the elite look, I'm going to recommend a shirt with a collar. Now, starting things off, we can go with a soft collar like we see in a classic polo. And right above that in a solid color, we're going to see a casual button down. Now, the difference between a casual button down and a dress shirt oftentimes is going to be the material and dress shirts by historic definition are of a lighter color. White is the classic, but we're also going to see light blues. And nowadays, of course, it's not uncommon to find a dress shirt in any of the pastels. And of course, let's not forget patterns, the classic stripes and a variety of wits, a variety of colors, and the most casual of dress shirts, the checks. So, now, let's get into jackets. And we're going to talk about sports jackets, we're going to talk about suit jackets, but before that, I want to talk about the importance of casual jackets. And the reason they're important is that so many men have forgotten that when a man puts on a jacket, it builds up the shoulders, it lengthens the torso, it slims up his silhouette. The reality, gents, is almost every man looks better with a jacket on whether it be casual, whether it be a bit dressy. So, knowing this, even if you're putting together and you're inspired to put together a casual wardrobe, look for casual jackets that enhance your style. Fatigue jackets, safari style jackets, leather jackets, suede jackets, jean jackets, even shirt jackets and sweater jackets can enhance a man's silhouette. And the layering, especially with a collared shirt, can give a much more elegant timeless style to what would have been an otherwise relatively boring outfit. Now, all that being said, if you could learn to master the sports jacket or the blazer, this is going to be a huge step up for most men even in a casual setting. And one of the things I talked about at the beginning of this video is dressing for yourself. I don't know about you, but I like to be mistaken as the man in charge. And I promise you, gents, if you start wearing a sports jacket, if you start wearing a blazer or you start wearing a suit even casually, people are going to start calling you sir, they're going to think you're the guy running things. And it's funny, the biggest excuse I hear about this isn't so much the money because you can't actually find suits relatively inexpensively. But, actually, so many guys assume that it's uncomfortable. It's not uncomfortable, it's unfamiliar. But once you start leveling up your style, again, once you start dressing for yourself because you know when you own your image, when you command respect by the way that you dress, gents, it's a game changer. I want to love about this especially compared to fitness and a lot of other self-improvement things. You could actually improve your style in a single afternoon. Now, of course, mastering your style usually takes a bit longer. And if that's you, if you want to learn how to master your style, gents, I got you covered with this video right here. A little bit more advanced, it's a solid video. Check it out. Boom, right here. Oh, yeah, you're going to love it. Come on. Yeah, boom, right there."

        "transcript": " So, over the last couple of weeks, I have examined over 8,000 images of Donald Trump. In any case, the reason I did this is to get an idea of how often he wears a red tie. Per my calculations, he wears a red tie approximately 70% of the time, which I was happy seeing that number till I had someone on my team double check this and they felt the number was closer to 80% of the time. And then, it even got more confusing and one of my researches pointed out a lot of these photos were taken on the same day just at different times, different settings, different angles. And, shouldn't we break this in the time frames maybe stick with certain decades? And then, when he's wearing casual clothing, does that even fit into the percentages? So, for the record, I'm just going to say the majority of the time that Donald Trump wears a necktie, it is the color red. And the question is why? Now, initially, probably like you, I thought I knew the answer. But, after doing the research and yes, we did a lot of it, it turns out the reason that he wears a red necktie is a little bit more nuanced. So, what are those reasons? What's the secret behind the red necktie? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video. So, in today's video, I'm going to be laying out these five reasons why Donald Trump wears a red necktie. But, before I give you these reasons, I think it's important to understand why does Donald Trump always wear a suit? Who inspired him? Where does this style come from and who did he imitate? So, Donald Trump was born June 14th, 1946 in Queens, New York. He was the fourth child of Fred and Marianne Trump and had a bit of a reputation in his early years as being a difficult child. In fact, Fred Trump to guide his son's behavior actually enrolled him into the New York Military Academy. Now, having served in the Marine Corps, I met a lot of guys that had spent their formative teenage years at military academies around the world. And whether they loved it or they hated it, they all had one thing in common, they learned to pay attention to the details. These places are attended and run by people that are OCD. You can't handle the truth. About everything being in the right place, the small details, the ribbons on your uniform being perfectly aligned. And everyone I knew coming out of those systems, they were anal retentive about the details on uniforms and their clothing. Now, after the military academy went to college for two years at Fordham and then transferred to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1968 and right afterwards he went to work for his father. And when it comes to style and inspiration, you can't deny that Donald Trump wasn't influenced by his father, Fred. I mean, just look at these guys right here. It's safe to say they probably got dressed by the same tailor, which makes sense because the Trump family business was real estate and they were looking to move up into luxury real estate and you got to dress the part. You live it in New York City during 1970s and 1980s. This is the pentacle of the real estate world and you want to look the part of a luxury real estate mogul. Well, yeah, you're going to dress the part because your image speaks before you even get a chance to open your mouth. And Trump moved out quick. I mean, it helps that your father owns the company, but by 1971 he was the president of the company. In 1978, he moved to the most expensive real estate market in the world, Manhattan, with his family renovating the derelict Commodore Hotel. In 1988, he'd acquired the Plaza Hotel. And in 1996, he acquired Forty Wall Street, which would later be rebranded no surprise as the Trump building. Now, I could go on and on about the real estate, but that's not why you're here. Let's get back to style. So, in the 1970s when we look at the images of Donald Trump, what do we see? His suit and armor is a suit and tie. It makes sense. He's standing in his father's shadow, he's working right there in New York. He needs a suit of armor that's going to allow him to get the job done and not distract him. Now, he was influenced a bit by the era, so a lot of his lapels, a lot of his ties in that time period are going to be a little bit wider. But, again, the biggest influence is the man that's behind him, his father Fred, who had his own unique style developed in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. And seriously, when you look at Fred Trump, the dude seriously had style three-piece suits, pocket squares. He looked every bit the established New York businessman. So, it's safe to say in Donald's world, he knew that the suit screamed, I mean business. Now, in the 1990s, we had an interesting development. Let's look at this jacket right here. Do you spot? I know a lot of you guys maybe don't know suits. It looks like a regular suit. This is actually a double-breasted suit. Now, in case you're knowing today, the majority of suits 99% sold are going to be single-breasted suits. But, 100 years ago, double-breasted suits and single-breasted suits used to sell at about the same percentage. And fashion-wise, they do come back, it seems like every other decade. And for guys that know, the double-breasted suit actually is a bit more formal than a single-breasted suit. So, why did Donald jump on it? Probably like any of us, he fell into a little bit of a fashion trend. But, also based off his age, knowing that his father probably owned quite a few, it probably was a bit nostalgic as well. In any case, it was the show The Apprentice that really put Donald Trump on the map for a national and worldwide audience. Yeah, prior to that, he was known throughout the real estate world. He was a bit of a New York socialite. But, The Apprentice and the success of that show put him on a whole other level. And his dark suits with bold ties gave him a visual signature. And now, let's talk the political years from 2015 to present. Well, over the last decade, almost all of the suits that I've seen are single-breasted. And when it comes to color, approximately 60 to 70 percent of them are going to be navy blue. Now, if you know anything about suits, this makes sense because it's one of the most popular colors out there. The color is associated with authority, professionalism, and stability. Now, another color that he likes to wear is black, about 20 to 25% of the time. Now, I personally don't like black suits. I think it should be reserved for formal wear only. No, the better option is charcoal gray, which then accounts for 10 to 15% of the suits he's been seeing. Now, what about other colors? Like colored suits like what Obama wore here. And I don't know why so many people were upset with Obama's choice of a suit. I actually think it looks good. But, in any case, in the last decade, it seems like Donald Trump hasn't worn anything like that, which I think is good because of his color palette and that orange hair. Yeah, it's just not going to work. It's not going to look good. Now, I promise we're about to talk about tie color, but first, let's talk about the length of his necktie. Why is it so frigging long? Well, gents, if you've watched any of my videos, I talk about the importance of the length of your necktie falling right at about the belt buckle point. You can be an inch above an inch below, but in general, this is the area that you want to fall. The Donald on the other hand, his necktie, this thing goes all the way down to his crotch, which I don't know. Maybe there's a hidden meaning there. But, assuming that he is tying his own neckties, I'd have to say this is probably habit and it's a belief that I sort of agree with that it's better to have a longer necktie than too short of a necktie. And personally, I've done this especially if I'm in a hurry, if I tie the necktie a little bit too long, I can actually tuck it into my trousers and just keep the shirt button the entire time. I mean, seriously, this necktie here is falling all the way down to my feet and you didn't even notice. And what about the tape that he's got sometimes at the back of that necktie? Well, almost all neckties have a catch in the back. And this is for catching that skinny part of the necktie and sliding it right in. However, if you're wearing your necktie really long, then that short end doesn't always reach the catch. Yet, it's long enough that it can still get in the way. So, I can imagine one of his assistants going over his style, going over his image before he's on camera and putting a piece of tape on the back of that necktie to try to keep it in place. So, why does he choose the color red? Well, according to Psychology Today, red ties elicit perceptions of power and dominance, aligning perfectly with Trump's self-styled image as an alpha lead. So, red signals power and authority. If you've watched a lot of my videos, you know I've brought up research, I've talked about this in detail. In fact, there was a classic study about 15 years ago in which students watched the same professor give the same exact lecture, but in one video he was wearing a red sweater, in the other one a blue sweater. Well, guess what? The professor in the red sweater was considered to be much more believable. Even though it was the same guy, the same words, the same recording, they just altered the color. And this has been repeated again and again a little bit of red in your clothing somehow convinces people that you are more believable because you are viewed as an authority. So, the idea of dominance and strength being associated with a color, well, that's really attractive as to why Trump would choose that color. However, I don't think this is the reason he actually chooses this necktie color. And the reason being is he's been wearing this color since the 1960s. And don't get me wrong, I really like this reason. And somebody at some point is probably explaining to him that red is a power color and that makes him come off as more dominant. So, that's probably reinforced him wearing it, but I don't think it's the reason he started wearing red. Now, another reason I've seen floated out there is that red is the color of the Republican Party. And that makes a lot of sense except for the fact, again, that he's been wearing red for a lot longer than he was associated with the Republican Party. Now, again, this could encourage him to wear red more often. He's probably had somebody on his team point this out and it sticks with a person whenever you have other people reinforcing the way you look saying it looks good and it makes you look amazing. Well, you're more likely to wear that color. So, I can see this is having some effect especially it may be an important event like an inauguration. You want to give a nod, you want to make sure that color is there. And right with that, there's the theory of patriotism, red, white, and blue. You're wearing the blue navy suit with the white shirt with that red necktie. I mean, the only thing that could be more patriotic is him dressed up as a founding father holding an eagle and a minigun. Which, seriously, how do they even get him to pose for this thing? Now, another interesting reason that I've heard especially if you're into marketing is brand recognition. The reality is if Donald shaved his head if he wasn't wearing a suit, if he was walking down the street in a t-shirt and jeans, maybe he grows a goatee puts on a baseball cap, I bet a lot of people would not recognize him. Gents, when it comes to branding, when it comes to image, it was the apprentice that really, again, put him on the map. And what do we expect to see? Donald Trump in that dark colored suit with a red necktie with that white dress shirt. But, again, is this the reason that he started wearing the red necktie? No, I don't think so. The real reasons, and yes, I think that there are two. One of them I revealed earlier and that is his father, Fred, and the influence of his style on Donald. I mean, look at how often Fred wore a red necktie. I think we underestimate the power of people around us. And his father, for many years, was the most influential person in his life. He saw the way his father walked in a room, commanded respect, and it just looked good with his complexion with his colors so Donald would follow suit. And the second reason why he would stick with red, he probably got some early compliments and it became part of his image. It became a habit. It became a go-to color. He probably has dozens if not hundreds of options in his wardrobe and they're all very similar. So, for him, this is a no-brainer. It's a go-to uniform that he believes makes him look great. And, therefore, as we've talked about in the cloth cognition, you perform better when you feel you're wearing the right uniform, when you feel your clothing looks good on you. And so, for him, it was a loop. He had his uniform and he would just default to it. A great disagree, wish I would have done this video on Kamala, yeah, whatever. Guys, go to the next video right here. I got you covered. I'm not going to talk politics here, but, yeah, this one was an interesting one. Had a lot of fun with it. Let me know if you agree, disagree. And let's just go to something more controversial. Let's talk about why with the Nazis so stylish. Some people down there are going to say, I can't believe you talked about Trump. Okay, how about we talk about Nazis? Let's go, yeah, let's have some fun right here, guys. And there's no, yeah, there's no connection here, but, yeah, check it out. Good video. I think so. Boom, right there."

        "transcript": " So, you throw on a jacket, you're stepping out to grab a newspaper. Headlines read the armorous Titanic just launched in Belfast, Ireland. Almondson became the first person to reach the South Pole. There are revolutions going on both in Mexico and China and both the US Navy and the US Postal Service are trying out this new invention called the Airplane. The year is 1911. And as you're walking down the street in downtown San Francisco, New York, London or Chicago, every respectable man you see is wearing a vest. Now, of course, they're wearing their vests underneath the jacket and technically they're called waistcoats. But, in any case, every single adult man owns at least a few of them. In 1911, we had reached peak vest. Based off some estimates, we would see over 20 million vests sold that year. With the total US population being well under 100 million, that figure as a percentage is even more impressive. But, fast forward just 45 years to the mid-1950s, all of a sudden we see that less than 10% of men are sporting vests. And by the 1970s, that percentage had dropped to under 3%. And what makes that number even less impressive is that the majority of men that still own waistcoats are only wearing them with formal wear, aka black tie tuxedos. So, what happened to the waistcoat? Why did men stop wearing them? Well, the answer, gents, is right here in this photo. So, do you see it? The clue is there. And I promise you, by the end of this video, it will be obvious to you. But before we get into why the vest disappeared, we need to first establish why men started wearing them at all. And the reason goes back to Charles II who didn't want to be Francis little b****. Let me explain. One of the most interesting things about the waistcoat is we know the exact date of its birth, 1666. And we know this because the documents are still out there. It was decreed that the king, Charles II, wanted to establish a unique English style. You see, the French had been the enemy for years. Yet, when you looked at the way the English dressed in their court, it was 100% influenced, inspired, and in Charles II's mind controlled by the French. And Charles II, he didn't like this one bit. In fact, he equated it with France making English its mistress. And the king was apparently egged on by the writer John Evelyn who wrote in the pamphlet Tyrannus in 1661, would the great persons of England but own their nation and assert themselves as they ought to by making choice of some viral and comely fashion. And in 1666, when the waistcoat made its debut, he described it as the most graceful, viral, and useful mode that ever appeared at court. So, at this point, the English are all full of themselves at Lated because they have now set the trend. Which by the way is actually not the case because Charles II had come up with the idea after seeing the styles of adventurer Sir Robert Shirley who had actually borrowed it from the Persian court of Shah Abbas the Great. Now, the original waistcoat was actually really long. It would go down past the knees and they were adorned, colored, and these things were pretty darn elaborate. And of course, they showed status because they were only worn by men of means that could afford to have them made. Now, by the 1700s, the garment was short and we also saw a wide variety of materials. Initially they used English wools, but a lot of men started to choose silk because it was just more elegant, it was beautiful, and it layered well. And from a practical perspective, the shortened version was actually very functional because it was sleeveless and cut close to the body. It provided the insulation layer of the most important part of the human body, the torso, and therefore was incredibly functional three quarters of the year in England. Fridun from sleeves also made it really good work wear because you had full movement of the arms. So, when you started to perspire, you actually had a little bit of venting in the armpits. And throughout the 1800s, the vest became commonplace. Overall, the styles became much more muted and a man with money would have a range of waistcoats made. Soaks for the summer for suits and formal wear, heavier wools and tweeds for whenever it got cold. And because these vests were also made from the same material as suits, all of a sudden you had the emergence of the three-piece suit. Now, functionally, if you're wearing a suit in the 1800s, the vest solved a lot of problems. First up, it kept your tie in place. Next up, it hid your suspenders, which believe it or not was a big deal because suspenders, your shirt underneath all of these accessories, these were considered almost like underwear and in a sense they needed to be layered and covered. In fact, that's one of the reasons the vest has survived so long because in formal wear, black tie aka the tuxedo, a vest is worn to hide and create a more elegant look of where the shirt meets the trousers. In fact, if you ever look to grab a vest, make sure it is long enough. A vest even with your arms raised should still cover the meeting point of the shirt and the trousers, which on a side note was a lot higher in the 18th century because most men were wearing high-waisted trousers. But, why we stopped to wear high-waisted trousers? That is a whole other video. That's a great idea. So, at the turn of the century, we have reached peak waistcoat. Every respectable man that wears a jacket owns one and most men own half a dozen or more in various materials. So, what happened? Now, gents, if you're enjoying today's video, you really should check out the free community I've created for you over on school. Seriously, there's no catch. It's absolutely free.

And if you're interested, we also got a fragrance community, the Brotherhood of Scent and a watch community. So, if you're into fragrances or you're into watches, go check out those communities. I'll link to them as well down in the description. So, what happened? Why did the waistcoat disappear? Let me start by asking, did you see that movie all quiet on the western front? I loved it. I think it's one of the best anti-war movies I've ever seen. And it had me hooked right at the intro where we see clothing taken off the dead soldiers, washed of its blood, dried, then sewn back up and handed to the new clueless recruits. So, what does that have to do with the waistcoat? Because in 1914, the world for the first time saw total war. Basically, you had countries dealing with shortages and having to make cuts in areas that previously they had no problem spending resource on. One of those big areas was the manufacture of clothing. So, by the start of World War I, fabric rationing throughout Europe and even the United States was commonplace and what you saw a lot of civilian garments they stopped making them. And the designers that were formally doing runways, well, guess what, now they're designing uniforms with conservation and functionality in mind. They wanted something that was durable that used the least amount of fabric. Now, Vesta waistcoats still served a purpose. They were really good for providing an insulating layer, but they were made in less numbers and most importantly for their life, they weren't made to be a part of uniforms. Now, after the Great War, things kind of returned back to normal in 1920s, 1930s. We again saw the production of the vest shoot up because again, it was functional and it was something men were used to wearing. But the numbers at least percentage wise weren't like they were before World War I. By the early 1940s, the entire world is rationing their fabric and materials and at the same time we're seeing advancements in the way the fabrics are being made. They're more weather resistant, more durable. They do a better job insulating. Well, with all these advancements in fabric technology and again, uniforms did not leverage the vest. So, you got all these GIs returning from the war used to wearing more comfortable clothing than their fathers did. Well, guess what? By the 1950s, the demand and production of the vest has dropped significantly. So, yeah, when you're looking at this image, it now makes a lot of sense, right? Now, the next reason the vest disappeared, let's talk about office heating. When we were at peak vest in 1911, we had a huge demographic shift happening. Tons of men throughout the world were leaving the rural areas and migrating to the cities for jobs that paid better. In a year in 1911, even if you worked indoors, it was luxury if your office had indoor heating. And as that more than half American men still worked outside and not to mention when they moved around transportation wise, yeah, there was no heating in those train cars. That new invention called the automobile didn't even have a closed compartment. A lot of guys were riding horses or in carriages going to and from. Obviously, by 1920 to the 1930s, things had changed. Indoor heating in the city has now become commonplace. Offices are still cool, but they're relatively comfortable. Inside a train for public transportation, it's now sealed better and some of the fans of your cars have heating. And speaking of fancy, those automobiles all of a sudden are starting to have sealed enclosures and some of them even have heaters. And while you can see where this is going, by the 1950s, indoor heating across the spectrum with where men are spending their time is commonplace. So the need for an extra layer to keep you warm, it's pretty much disappeared. Now, the next reason may seem a little bit less important, but it's incredibly powerful because human beings want to be like other human beings. Yeah, by the late 1950s and into the 1960s and 70s, all of a sudden we have tons of young men rejecting the old school styles of their fathers and grandfathers. And the waistcoat was a part of that style. In addition, with the disappearances of suspenders and the rise of the belt, all of a sudden wearing garment to hide the suspenders didn't really make much sense. And his style became much more casual. We saw the rise of the jumper, the sweater, it had been around forever. Knitwear, that is, but it was often reserved for much more casual situations. However, by the 1960s, by the 1970s, knitwear and sweaters are becoming much more common daily wear for men. And by the 1970s, 19 Asia seeing it even mixed in with formal wear. And because of its properties and ability to stretch, for many guys they felt it was more comfortable, less expensive and more functional than getting a custom-made vest. Because, yeah, by the 1970s, they're becoming harder to find. Therefore, if you want to get one, you got to either go to a men's specialty shop or have it custom made for you. And as a former clothe, I will tell you a well-cut vest that fits the body is one of the hardest garments to make. Seriously, ask any tailor for a vest to look good on a hard to fit body type? That thing has to be cut just right. That being said, if you're in decent shape, just make sure it fits you in the chest, get it with that adjuster in the back and you will be just fine. So, by the 1970s, men's style is much more casual. The two-piece suit reigns. And even that garment is starting to see a decline. So, with all this bad news with the waistcoat, why didn't it disappear? Why did it stick around? Well, I mentioned earlier the majority of your vests are still sold today as a part of a formal wear outfit. In case you didn't know, when it comes to dressing black tie, there are actually set rules. So, some people find off-putting my answer to this is it makes it really simple. You just simply dress per the rules and the guidelines. And, yes, if you want to change it up, you want to have fun, I always say you can break one rule whenever you're putting your black tie outfit together. But the rule in formal wear is that you need to cover the area where the shirt meets the trousers. Now, you can do this with a cummerbund which comes out of India and there's a really cool piece of menswear, but the more traditional and more formal way to do this is to wear a proper black tie waistcoat. But, having said that, why do we still see the waistcoat outside of black tie? Well, first up, unlike a lot of other items that have disappeared in menswear, the waistcoat for some is still functional. A small percentage of men out there still wear suspenders and so they use a waistcoat to cover it. And I do find if you have a white collar job where you spend a lot of time in the office or a lawyer, you're a banker, you're a consultant, you want to maintain a dress up appearance that allows the eyes to go up and down when you take your jacket off which some guys like to do. You know, for that reason the waistcoat just can't be beat. A lot of guys as well enjoy bringing in a bit of color. In case you haven't noticed the waistcoat on wear on the back of it has some really fun patterns and colors to it. And some guys out there who wear a suit on a daily basis love the color they can bring to their outfit when they wear an odd waistcoat. One that is made from different material and sometimes even a striking color that brings a bit of pop to their outfit. There's also something to be said how it raises the V. On a two-button jacket, you're going to find that the gorge with the left and right flaps overlap is actually relatively low. By wearing a waistcoat, you actually raise that V up and you can give your outfit a more formal look. So, yeah, the three-piece suit has become less popular, but it still survives because some guys just love it. In addition, it should be noted I've been using the word vest and waistcoat interchangeably. Technically, a vest is a waistcoat that is made to be worn is outerwear. And that's another place where this garment has survived especially in the western wear seat. A well-fitted vest helps keep a tucked-in shirt from billowing out and going all over the place. In fact, one of my best friends, godfather to my daughter, Katya, Ryan Mashed, as you can see him, he loves the waistcoat. He wears it all the time when he goes out swing dancing and he loves how it brings a bit of color and a bit of style and flash to his overall outfit without getting in the way. In fact, if you're a photographer, I always recommend that they grab a good-looking waistcoat because if you're at a fancy wedding, everyone else is wearing a jacket, but you're moving around working, it's a great way to have a more buttoned-up look without retaining as much heat that would build up, yeah, with a jacket. And, of course, I got to give a shout-out to some of the subcultures out there like Steampunk and the Vintage Fashion Movement that have loved, maintained, and used and ensure the waistcoat lives on. Now, gents, if you enjoyed this video, you are going to love this one right here. Why did men stop wearing suspenders? Why did they stop wearing hats? Guys, I got you covered. Boom. Check it out. Both of these videos solid, yeah. Click right there. Check it out. Oh, yeah. Come on."

        "transcript": " One of the biggest mistakes that most men make when it comes to scarves is they don't even know that they've got options. They don't understand the accessory or how to wear it. Well, gents, don't worry, let me help you out here. So, you've got the classic wool scarf, you've got the high-end incredibly soft cashmere scarves, you've got the lightweight beautiful bright colored silk scarves. A common inexpensive option is going to be the fleece scarf. You're going to see these large circled scarves known as infinity scarves. Not all scarves are going to be long rectangles. In fact, you're going to find squares out there that can be tied in a variety of ways. Let's check out the bandana. Yes, that scarf worn by cowboys to keep dust basically from going down their shirts. And what about the classic shimak? Anyone that spends time over the Middle East in the desert, you understand the function of this very versatile piece of clothing and they do an excellent job of keeping the sand out. Seriously, when I was deployed over in Iraq and Kuwait, I remember seeing a number of soldiers pull this look off and absolutely love it because of its functional purposes. But, the second mistake guys make is they think scarves are for women. They see all the different styles, all the different colors they're like, you know, that's too much for me. Gents, if you think only women should be styling scarves, you don't know your history. Let's go back 2,300 years. Yeah, I'm talking ancient China. To be specific, we're looking at the third century BCE and the terra cotta soldiers. Now, in case you're not familiar with these guys, these are large lifelike statues that were buried with the first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Hong. Now, what's amazing about the terra cotta soldiers besides the total number and just the detail and the work that went into them is how they preserved the look in the uniform of the soldiers of that era. And guess what they're wearing? Scarves for function, not only protection, but identification. The scarves and simply, you know, where they wore them, the colors, this was to identify rank and what units you were a part of. And if you need another manly example, let's look at early aviators especially during World War I. What were they rocking? Silk scarves. Why? Because you needed that protection. Let's just say that when you're up there, open cockpit, you got the air all over the place. Not only did you need to stay warm, but you didn't want that wind chafing your skin and a scarf served the purpose of protecting the neck. All right, gents, so the next mistake a lot of guys make when it comes to scarves is they don't experiment with colors with patterns with all the different options they've got out there. Notice how I did change up the color of the scarf. Your eyes are probably drawn to it on that last point. This is not really a loud color. It's a pretty muted color. Now, the pattern definitely draws a little bit of attention especially when I've got a solid jacket, I've got a solid sweater on. This is what's going to draw the eyes and that's what you want to leverage when you bring in a scarf. This is such a fun way for you to bring in color to bring in pattern. When you're starting off with scarves, I get it maybe it's something new. You want to bring it into your wardrobe. You want to go with a classic gray. I like gray. It's a non-color that is going to match pretty much anything. And if you're wearing it with clothing that already has color, then, yeah, this makes sense. It's a functional accessory. I do like a scarf, though, that has two colors right in here because you can change it up. Even the little bit of contrast right here makes this a little bit more interesting. And, again, you can have fun with this scarf depending on how you fold it, depending on the knot that you go for. But, yeah, bring it in a scarf like this, which not only \u2013 I mean, it's relatively a thicker scarf as well. But, this pattern right here, not only is this warm because it's, again, first functional, but this color just allows me to have a little bit more fun with, you know, bringing it in and just simply pulling it off with my outfits. Now, if you want to get away from the function, you can actually bring in more decorative scarves. And you're going to find these are made from a variety of materials from linen to silk to sometimes polyester. This one right here has a very subtle pattern. It got a paisley in there just absolutely beautiful. Now, scarves like this, if tied properly, can look great and, to a degree, protect the neck. But, they're not going to have the same insulating properties as wool, as cashmere, as maybe mohair. And let's talk about those different fabrics and why you would want to choose them. So, for the guy just starting off, I'm going to highly recommend that you stick with wool. It's relatively easy to find and it's got great insulating properties, not only when it's dry, but also when it's wet. So, if you're sweating, it's going to absorb the sweat and it's going to actually keep you warm. Wool has this really unique property that can absorb almost its full weight in basically water and it still feels dry. Now, a drawback with wool is you have to take care of it. You can't just throw this into the washing machine that's going to end up ruining the scarf. It can also be a little bit pricey depending on where you buy them. You will find blends and blends are interesting. If you find something, you like the feel of it, nothing wrong with going with it. Now, what about polyesters? What about synthetic materials, flannels and things like that? I think that they are fine, especially if you are a man on a budget. Now, long-term and usually the styling of them isn't going to be as nice unless you go with a solid color. The feel people can tell if you would go up, you know, that it isn't a wool or a casimir or anything like that. But, I think from a functionality perspective, they do serve a great purpose. And if you want to own a variety of scarves, again, you've got a really tight budget, I think that it's perfectly acceptable to have a man-made fiber scarf. Now, what about casmiers? What about mohairs? So, these are going to be higher end and oftentimes, again, you're going to see them blended with wools, but they're just going to cost more. They aren't going to have any better insulating properties than wool. Maybe they're just going to feel a little bit softer. They're going to be more exclusive. You'll find a lot of high-end brands start to bring in really unique patterns and looks that other people pick up on. So, for a status symbol, I do see why some people pick them up and why they love them, especially if you're into fashion. And, again, if it's just something you enjoy, you really find one that, hey, yes, it costs three times more than just an average wool, but you really like the pattern, you're going to wear the heck out of it, then go for it. I've talked about, you know, my, what is it my style, theory of value. And this is how does something when you wear it make you feel and then take that cost and when you divide it by the number of wares, you may find because if you wear this thing for five years almost every day during the winter, you are going to get more than your money's worth out of it versus a scarf that, yeah, just is a bit itchy, you don't really like and you rarely ever wear that you spent, yes, one-third as much, one-fourth as much, but you never felt good in it. Now, what about silk scarves? So, you notice that this is a blue, this is a blue, different shades of blue, but also a different feel and a different sheen on the surface. Silk does have that look and it's very, you know, for lightweight protection, silk is fine. Right now, it's like negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm not going to be wearing a silk scarf for functionality. Silk scarves have a long-stored history with aviators and a lot of women love to wear them to decorate or basically draw attention. A lot of fashion forward men love to wear them as well. I think that it can work great with a sports jacket. Is it going to be something I'm going to recommend for a guy just starting off the answer would be no. But, again, if you are getting into this, if you really like to be able to bring in a bit of color, there's nothing wrong with grabbing a silk scarf. Again, if you love the pattern, you love the overall look. I do think larger silk scarves can look really nice, smaller ones like this that don't have, you know, they're just, you know, big rectangles, so-so. But, I've seen square ones especially from higher end brands that just look amazing. But, again, if it's your thing, if you're a little bit more fashion forward, then guys, rock it and enjoy it. And, by the way, gents, if you've got a favorite type of scarf, I want to hear from you down in the comments, the colors, the patterns, what looks good on you, maybe your favorite brands. Guys, I want to hear from you down in the comments below. Gents, if you want to step up your style efficiently and effectively, look for a proven path. A curriculum that saves you from confusion, from bad information, from crappy teachers. You want to make sure that you're not just learning facts, but you actually are being shown concepts. Lessons that give you foundations, they give you the fundamentals to be able to dress sharp in any situation. It's also great if you can surround yourself with like-minded men because how many times you've tried to learn something and there are other people that don't want to be there, they're distracting you, or worse, they're tempting you to go do something else. Which is why, gents, I wanted to show you this. My new free group for you that not only has instruction, but an amazing community that is distraction free. It's got a great app and I say it's free. Guys, I developed this for you. Finally, I found a platform that makes this so simple, so easy, and so effective for you to be able to step up your style. Seriously, gents, I've got courses in this community that I used to sell. You can get for free. I've set up prizes, I've gamified it. Guys, I'm going to link to it down in the description. Or if you just want to go over to the URL, it's at school.com slash rmrs. This group is free, although you do have to answer three questions. These, I don't ask for your email address. I simply want to make sure that we keep spammers out of the group. It's a high-quality group. It's an amazing community that I am proud to give to you guys. Now, this next mistake is relatively tiny except when it's not. And that is to take good care of your scarf, to keep track of them especially if you're buying one in wool. And you can throw it around until you put it in an area that all of a sudden moths find it and they, yes, eat holes into it. So, take good care of your luxury materials. Silk, yes, you bought that nice silk scarf, but you didn't store it properly and it gets for some reason wet. It develops mold. These are the type of things that when you spend good money on something, I do hope that you take care of it. Now, let's talk about the blends in materials. Blends, one of the issues you can have when you've got different lengths of fabric and fibers inter-twenty intermixing with each other is that you can get pilling. If you start to see pilling on a scarf, one of the easiest things to do is simply take a razor and remove it. But, understand if you're seeing pilling, over time, the scarf is going to lose some of its basically, you know, that pilling that material is going somewhere. You're taking it off, so it's going to lose over time some of its thickness and it will eventually, yeah, probably not be something that you'll want to use in five to ten years. That being said, I know that I've got quite a few scarves and I really haven't had really too many issues with pilling, but I do know if you've got one that you wear all the time, some people have reached out to me about it. And, let's also talk about cleaning. So, if you wear the same scarf every day, again, it's picking up sweat, it's picking up skin. This is something that you don't want to invite, you know, mites or tiny bugs, they would, yeah, I mean, so once a season send it out to be cleaned whenever you send out your sweaters and your jackets. But, you know, if you don't wear them very often, I think you can go years between cleaning them or do it yourself. Now, really quick, what's some practical advice to start wearing a scarf, especially one that maybe brings in patterns and colors? And the answer is wear it to and from work. A lot of people, they reserve these fancy scarves when they're going out, you know, to meet with friends, they're going on a date, maybe they're going out with their woman, they want to look good and so, but they feel a little bit like an imposter. Here's the thing because you haven't practiced wearing it. Just simply make it a part of your outfit, put it with your jackets, put the scarf right in there, I always tuck it into the arms of my jacket so I've got different scarves I can wear. I just wear them to and from work for nobody but myself. And when you practice wearing the scarf, you get used to the scarf being on your neck, being around you. You just start to actually feel and love it. You start to pick up maybe your favorite fragrances, you start to smell them in there. But, here's the thing is you forget about it. And when you forget about it, it becomes just part of you, part of an extension of your style. And all of a sudden, you're throwing it and you're not even thinking about it until someone says, you know what, like he is always looking good. I love his choice of scarves. I wish my husband, I wish my boyfriend, I wish other people would start to just look, I mean, you just start putting it together. And you also have fun with different jackets, different outfits. It becomes an accessory that maybe before you never paid any attention to, all of a sudden you start noticing other guys pulling off looking great and scarves, you give them compliments. And, by the way, that's the secret to getting compliments is you give them. And, yeah, you just start to notice the world of scarves and all the options, all the colors it brings to your outfits. So, the next mistake a lot of guys make when it comes to wearing a scarf is they don't know how to tie a scarf properly. Now, when it comes to wearing a scarf, there are many different ways. Let's start with the drape which is as simple as it gets. The drape leans more towards style rather than function and should be used for when the weather is cool but not cold. As the name implies, just drape the scarf over your neck and you're good to go. If you would like it to be a little more functional, you can tuck the ends of the scarf into your jacket for extra warmth. Next, we have the once-around. This one provides more warmth around the neck than the drape and so can be worn in colder weather. Start by draping the scarf over your neck making one end longer than the other. Take the long end and bring it around your neck and you're done. The ends of the scarf can either be equal length or uneven, it really up to the wearer's preference. Next up, we've got the cowboy. The cowboy not adds western charm to your winter look. Drape the scarf over your neck with one end noticeably longer. Take the longer end, wrap it around your neck twice, then tuck one side into the neck ensuring the shorter side is beneath creating a distinctive shape. Now, we have the chest warmer which is more complex than it appears at first glance. Drape the scarf over your neck then cross it in front of your chest before bringing the ends around your back. Tie the two ends together in the back and then tie up your jacket and you're all set. This knot is a great way to add a little extra warmth to a jacket. Next, let's talk about the reverse drape. This is a great option for colder weather as it provides a lot of protection to the neck. Drape the scarf over your neck making sure both ends are of equal length. Take one end of the scarf and bring it across your neck and over the opposite shoulder then do the same with the other side. Adjust it around your neck if necessary and you're done. Next up, the Parisian knot, a very classy looking scarf knot. It provides good warmth to the neck and is a good choice in colder weather. Fold your scarf in half widthwise then fold it half again lengthwise. Drape it over your neck and then bring the loose ends through the hole formed by the folded end. Tighten the scarf around your neck and you're ready to go. Next up, we've got the fake knot. It's a more complicated knot to tie but it's a great cold weather option. Drape the scarf over your neck making one end longer than the other. Take the long end and bring it behind and around itself to form a loop. Then take the end down and through the loop. Grab the other end of the scarf and bring it down and through the loop as well. Work the knot up to your neck by gently pulling on each end while sliding the knot up. Now, the reverse tuck. Not too commonly seen, this scarf knot works best with longer scarves. Drape the scarf over your neck making one end longer than the other. Take the long end and loop it once around your neck. Now, take the same end and tuck it through the loop you just formed. Grab the other side and tuck it through the loop as well then adjust if necessary. Next up, the reverse cross. Very similar to the reverse tuck, this knot works great for longer scarves. Drape the scarf over your neck and make one end longer than the other. Take the long end and bring it up and around your neck. Now, cross the long end over the other end then bring it up and through the opening you just formed. Pull on the ends to tighten if needed and you're done. Next, the four in hand. Another great choice for long scarves, this knot protects the neck very well and is the perfect option when the weather is freezing cold. Like the Parisian knot, fold the scarf in half length and width wise and then drape it over your neck. Take one of the loose ends and pull it through the loop formed by the folded end, twist the loop then pull the other end through the loop, continue to adjust the knot until it is sitting neatly around your neck. And let's not forget about the twice around. This is the best choice for freezing weather next to the four in hand but it is much simpler to tie. Drape the scarf over your neck making one end much longer than the other. Take the long end and wrap it around your neck then repeat again bringing it around your neck a second time. Adjust if needed to completely cover your neck. So, what to watch next? How about stop wearing these seven items because they're making you look old? I put this video out a while back but it is still relevant especially if you're in your late 20s, 30s, 40s. Come on, you don't want to look like you're 150 years old. Go check it out, guys. Stop wearing this stuff because it is doing you no favors."

        "transcript": " Dior Sauvage, Chanel's blue to Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent's Y, EDP, Versace's Dylan Blue, Dolce & Gabbana's light blue intents, Montblanc's legend blue, M. Mekilev's desire toxic intents, Coach's blue EDT. Hi, gents. Did you see the pattern? So, every single one of those fragrances could be classified as a blue fragrance. And, in case you don't know what a blue fragrance is, it's a category in perfumery characterized by fresh clean versatile scent profiles. Blue fragrances often evoke the essence of water, air, and the outdoors. Think of the accords as citruses, aromatics, and aquatics mixed. Blue fragrances are designed to appeal to everybody. Unfortunately, they also get a bad rap as some fragrance snobs out there will say they're not unique enough. And I totally get it. There are some uninspiring blue fragrances out there. Not name and names here, but, yeah, I've wasted a lot of money on fragrances that are repetitive, don't bring anything new to the table. But, for a beginner, a guy buying his first fragrance, you can't go wrong with one of the blue fragrances I listed out at the beginning of this video. Okay, well, maybe some are a little bit overplayed, overworn. There were other ones on the list that I've been out for a few years, you can find great deals on and they are friggin amazing. The reality is though, these fragrances work and that's why the fragrance houses keep coming out with them. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find a person out there that doesn't love this one right here. Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful. It's almost perfect. That being said, if you want something unique, you can definitely go niche. There are blue variations out there that don't smell like anything else yet still fit this category. And in case you're wondering the fragrance that's credited with starting the craze is aptly named Bluetis Chanel by Chanel. If you're just getting started, you're a beginner, this is the video for you. So, if you're a bit advanced when it comes to fragrances, you're going to like this video because I'm going to throw in some niche fragrances. These are fragrances you're not going to find at your normal box store. Oftentimes, you're a little bit stronger, unique and really fun and rewarding if you find one that suits you. I got a lot of fragrances here, but I'm going to make this simple for you. I'm going to give you a lot of choices, but if you just grabbed one out of each of these categories, you can very easily build a versatile collection with honestly less than 10 fragrances. So, without further ado, let's get to our next category. Bulgaris Aqua, Po-Orm, Atlantique. Aqua de Jo, Profondo. Azaro's Chrome Aqua. Davidoff's Cool Water. Versace, Man of Fresh. Creed's, Milicine Imperial. Sergov's, Forty Knotts. So, can you guess which category those fragrances are in? As you probably guessed, those were all aquatics. Now, aquatics as you can guess are usually fresh light and have a marine element. Now, you may be asking how do they get a sea breeze note in a fragrance? I mean, seriously, what do you do? Go down to the beach and try to capture the wind in a bottle? No, the science behind it was a note developed in the 1980s called Calone. It's a synthetic compound that gives that sea breeze type of smell with a little bit of fruity and floral notes. Now, in this regard, Aqua de Jo is really unique because you see here we've got a wide range of flankers and oftentimes one of the things they're adjusting is the amount of the sea smell that we actually have in the fragrance. Another right here is actually very famous for being more aquatic. You got the sea weed, you got the kind of beach smell, but if that sounds at all off pudding, just grab the original EDT or in my opinion the EDP which is even better and it really does a good job of not overdoing the aquatic notes. Although, I really do like the profondo personally. I think it lasts longer, but the EDP is really it's probably the best of the bunch. For the guy that doesn't want to smell like the beach. Now, if you want something that's going to be a little bit more mainstream, more fresh, less on the aquatics, don't go with something that has Aqua in it. The original chrome actually is pretty good and easier to find, but right here Versace's Manifresh. This is a summer staple. And, in fact, the citrus top is really strong. We'll talk about citrus fragrances here in a second, but this one right here is an easy wear and gets compliments all day. And what I love about this category is the range in prices. If you're on a tight budget, just simply look to cool water. Tons of options there and they've got variations, they got flankers, they're going to be more aquatic than the original versus if you've got money to spend, then you can go with Creed which some people don't consider Creed niche anymore since they've been sold and they still make pretty darn good fragrances. They are pricey though, but Milicine Imperiale. Yeah, this is like fruit mixed in with the Mediterranean. Absolutely beautiful. It doesn't last very long. If you want something that's got longer staying power, it reminds a lot of people of Profumo except higher end. This is the guy that owns the yacht. This is what he's wearing, 40 knots by Sergeov. Now, I don't know if you noticed this, but I actually put these fragrances in a logical order. It took me a couple of hours to set this up, but we're going to move over to the left side of the table and talk about some of the lighter fragrances. So, options here Versace Eros Energy. Tirameses, Ojevres, however you pronounce it, sorry I'm not French. Dior's Ocevage Parfum, Creed's Irofa, Dunhill's Icon Racing, Isemiaki's Lodice Po'om, Jean-Varvetos, Artisan Pure, Dior'Ome Colombe, Arrakis by Spirit of Kings, Perseus by Parfumes de Marley. Mabesus A Wondrous Flight, Bergamask by Orto Prisi. Allure, Aum, Edition Blanche. Tom Ford, Costa Azura. So, all those fragrances I am going to label as citruses. Now, every single one of those fragrances has other notes and could probably be put into another category. Example, Versace's Manifrescia talked about this one earlier. This one could also be labeled as a citrus. You see, the reason I put all these fragrances in this category is because they have a very strong realistic opening citrus note. However, all of them when they dry down, that means when we switch from the top notes more to the middle and the base notes, we have other notes that reveal themselves. And in case you don't remember, citrus notes in general, they're going to be picked up at the outset when a fragrance is sprayed on your body. In addition, all of these citrus fragrances I put in this category because they are relatively light, meaning that you could wear them like right after the gym, hence sport. That being said, there are citruses out there that can go beast mode. Oftentimes, they're using a unique note like Yuzu or they're formulated through a niche house and made with certain compounds that are made to project. Now, if you were super observant, you probably saw that some of these fragrances aren't any that you have ever seen in a box store. And that's because quite a few of these were niche fragrances. Now, gents, if you're in the market for niche fragrances, you need to check out today's sponsor Max Aroma. So, yeah, the fragrance I've got right here, Arrakis from Senta Kings, absolutely beautiful and you're going to find over at Max Aroma. You're not going to find this in your local box store. A wonderous flight which has great projection, great staying power, a beautiful citrus top. Look at the breakout of the notes. That's why I love about a lot of these niche houses is they really take care of the package and have to say overall, this is absolutely beautiful scent. And, gents, I'm telling you, if you're looking for some of the best fragrances on the planet coming out of the Middle East, check out the spirit of Dubai. Right here, as you can see, I've got Bosqueer, an amazing fragrance, a little bit complex or maybe you want something slightly different, check out Abjar Bois. Absolutely beautiful packaging, absolutely beautiful bottle and what I love about the spirit of Dubai, these guys know how to blend notes. And on a personal note, the fragrance I'm wearing today, check out the house of Ojar specifically Wood Whisperer. This is a woody powder amber fragrance with a really clean woody powdery smell that gets compliments. Seriously, every time I've worn this, I've had somebody say you smell amazing. And if you're an advanced fragrance guy, you're looking for something unique that nobody else is wearing, check out Paramore by Oman Luxury. This one as you can see here, it's got really strong masculine notes. This fragrance right here projects it goes beast mode. And besides Wood Whisperer, if I were to recommend any fragrance for a blind buy, check out Em Mika Lef's Red Colorado. We've got the pines with the woods. It's a very simple yet complex, absolutely beautiful fragrance, easily one of the best from the Em Mika Lef line which, by the way, you can find the entire line over at Maxaroma. Love the way they ship quick, package well. And when it comes to the niche fragrances, you can't find anywhere else, yeah. Maxaroma is where it's at. Down in the description of today's video, I'm linking over to Maxaroma with the best deals you're going to find this holiday season. So, with that being said, to our next category. Burberry Hero Oda Parfum Armani Code EDT Mont Blanc Legend EDP Creeds Original Santal Hermeses Terre Mes Tom Ford's Ood Wood Wood Whisperer in Red Colorado. All right, with the inclusion of these last two, I think you figured out which category this is, right? All right, gents, let's talk about woods. Now, anyone that's ever been outdoors, been around wood, been on lumber store, you know the smells I'm talking about. And woods come in all different types. You've got Ood which is going to be a deeper richer, very earthy type smell versus Santa Wood which is much smoother, can be also much sweeter. And then, there were the woods that fall in between like cedar. Now, most of these wood fragrances are not going to be wood dominant like this one right here. Now, most of the wood fragrances especially the best sellers out there, these are going to usually have a citrus top, but the wood is what they're going to get to very quickly. This one right here by Burberry has actually made a pretty big splash. I really like this fragrance. The EDT, the EDP and the Parfum are all solid options. And for those of you guys in the know, you don't need to spend a crazy amount of money to get a great Santa Wood. I would be careful of jupe. You guys know I don't really like that fragrance a little bit too sweet, too much sandalwood with steroids and it just smells unnatural. But, yeah, if you don't want to spend hundreds of bucks, you just don't want to get the smell of original Santel, then check out Mont Blanc's Individual. Now, one of the things I absolutely love about wood fragrances is a lot of people associate the scent profile with masculinity. And the scent profile overall is universally appealing. Seriously, if you're just getting started with your fragrance collection, you cannot go wrong with a classic masculine woody scent. Yes, it's probably going to have some other earthy notes in it. This one right here has a little bit of maybe an overripe orange at the top, but believe it or not, this thing works. And this fragrance right here, Terri Ames, the classic, this thing is a compliment monster that most guys don't even know about. Sorry, I know some of you guys trying to keep that under wraps. In that case, just go grab Red Colorado by M. Mekalif and this right here is an amazing, amazing wood. Yeah. Now, for this next category, let's spice things up. First up, we got Bulgaris, man in black. Your Sauvage Elixir. Tom Ford's Noir Extreme. Dolce and Gabanos K, Intense and Dolce and Gabanos Intenso. Carolina Herrera's CH Men. Azaros, the most wanted EDP intense. So, what do all those fragrances have in common? These are the spicy fragrances categorized by warm exotic notes like cinnamon, peppers and cardamom. Now, the best example of this is Victor and Rolf and their Spice Bomb line. They've got a lot of flankers out there, got a lot of options, but in particular, they're in for red line, both the EDP and the Parfum. These fragrances are all about the cinnamon, the peppers. And what's interesting when you wear a spicy fragrance, these things project. These are fragrances when you want to walk into a room and you want to own it, people are going to pick up. There's just something that makes the nose tickle that's usually in these fragrances. Now, the fragrance houses do this to different degrees. If you want something that's a lot more muted, a very simple to wear spicy fragrance, simply look at Man in Black by Bulgari. Dolce and Gabanos, I showed you has a couple options. Intense, a little bit harder to find, still a classic, absolutely amazing, but Kay right here, the new intense one, this one is pretty darn good and relatively versatile for a spicy fragrance. Now, right next to the spicy and there is a lot of overlap here, but let's talk specifically about the orientals. Now, the oriental fragrances are very similar to the spicy fragrances, warm exotic notes, but there's a couple small difference. First up, you've got the spices, yes, but you've also got resins. So, it's going to be things like incense and fragrance and you also have the vanilla note. So, fragrances in this category, Jean-Paul Gattier's Elixir and actually pretty much any fragrance from Jean-Paul Gattier, the Paco Rabon 1 Million line, the original Versace Arrows. Now, the problem for a lot of guys with those fragrances I just talked about is that they're too loud, they're too in your face. I will say that they're great date fragrances especially for the guy that's going out, maybe club fragrances for the guy that wants to stand apart, but if you're looking for an oriental fragrance that isn't over the top, look for something that has the amber notes in it. And one of the best examples, most established fragrances in that realm is going to be Dolce Nibon is the one. Now, there are all types of versions of this. I still like the original or maybe the EDP. The intense is okay, but, yeah, you know, look around you can find the original out there at Discounters. As you're out there searching for it, you want something that's a little bit younger, something I think a guy in his twenties or thirties could easily pull off, check out Dunhill Custom. Again, this one isn't in your face, it's very similar to the one, but I would say a little bit more useful. Now, gents, if you're watching this video, you got questions, you want someone to answer them, you need to go check out our free group, The Brotherhood of Sentence. Seriously, this group right here, I've got all the infographics you saw in today's video. I've got my best deals. I give away fragrances. In this free group, you can join. I seriously think this is the world's best group for men's fragrances. I know not a whole lot of competition, but what I love about this group is got guys just like you that want to better understand fragrance and it's a really friendly, awesome community of guys looking to build the perfect fragrance collection. And, yeah, I've got too many fragrances, I give them away over in that group. So, gents, get over there and join. It's The Brotherhood of Sentence. So, starting off this next category, we've got Muglese, Amen. Jean Paul Gatt\u00e9's Scandal, Killian's Angel Share. And while we're at it, let's talk about Gold Knight and Straight to Heaven along with Apple Brandy and Black Phantom. Yeah, as you can tell, I like Killian especially with this category. Tom Ford's Black Orchid. So, the category I'm talking about here are known as Gourmands. These are fragrances that smell like something you could almost eat. Muglese did this really well, they've done it with almost all of their fragrances. This one I hear, Pure Malt. Jean Paul Gatt\u00e9, The Scandal Line, has done it really well with notes like Carmel. The House of Killian has done this really well, no surprise there, but, yeah, you know, Black Phantom has a rich chocolate note to it. Straight to Heaven has the smell of a barrel of whiskey that's been opened and is evaporating. Gold Knight has a unique honey note to it. And as strange as it may sound, those Gourmands notes, the smell of something that people just absolutely love. These were started on the women's side, but come to find out when a man wears this, he becomes irresistible to the opposite sex. So, if you want a set of fragrances that are really going to draw in the ladies, get your wife to eat you up, yeah, check out the Gourmands. What about aromatics? I will say if you're just starting off your collection, don't be afraid of earthy scents, especially vetavers. Some great options here are Goulon's vetiver and Creed's original vetiver. And a couple earthy masculine options. I know this is going to sound weird, but they smell like the ground after a rain. Well, you're going to want to check out Gucci Guilty Absolute and Bulgari Man's Terra Essence. And if you're really into that, you want something really herbaceous, you like the whole moss note, check out H24's Herbes Vives. That are the H24 EDP which I find a little bit more wearable.

        "transcript": " Let's take the colors in a well-dressed man's wardrobe. Easily, these seven colors right here can make up over 70% of his wardrobe. First up, we've got one of the most versatile colors in a man's wardrobe, charcoal gray. Perfect for trousers, sweaters, and jackets. Next up, we've got navy blue, a timeless color for trousers, blazers, jackets, and even shirts. Next up, we've got the color light gray, ideal for lightweight sweaters, shirts, and trousers. Next up, we've got the color black, essential for footwear and outerwear. And, of course, we've got the color white, perfect for dress shirts, polos, and simple t-shirts. Next up, we've got the color beige, aka tan. This color dominates when it comes to chinos and light jackets. And, of course, dark brown. Rich and warm, this color is perfect for footwear, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories like watch straps. Now, for some of you guys that watch quite a few of my videos, you know those colors are primary neutrals. By that, I mean the base versatile colors that any guy can start building his interchangeable wardrobe from. But, in today's video, I'm going to be a little bit more expansive and introduce you to the secondary neutrals. These colors include olive green. This color adds a bit of ruggedness in a military feel to a wardrobe and is ideal for jackets and trousers. The color camel, great for outerwear and occasionally a sweater or even chinos. Light blue, a perfect color to soften the look and a great choice for your casual shirts. And, an often looked over option, cream, aka ivory. This color has a subtle warmth and is perfect for sweaters and shirts. And, we could stop there, but I want to add four more colors that on average would make up about 10 to 15 percent of a man's wardrobe. But, these accent colors right here, guys, this is what adds the spice to your wardrobe. And, by the way, the colors I'm about to share with you in general work for most complexions. However, if you've got a go-to accent color that, yes, every time you wear you get compliments, people say, man, that brings out your eyes. That color just looks amazing on you. You know what I'm talking about. Think back, even if it's been years, that aqua or red shirt, that purple sweater you had years ago that every time you wore, you had people saying you looked amazing. And, don't be afraid to change about if some of the colors I'm about to share with you don't really appeal. And those colors are burgundy, rust, forest green, and slate blue. Now, with these colors with the accent colors as the name implies, these are going to be more for your accessories. These are going to be more for your shirts. When building an interchangeable wardrobe, you want to be really careful picking up a pair of shoes, trousers, or a jacket in an accent color. The reason being is it really stands out. It's almost too memorable and therefore not interchangeable. Now, as you can see here, those colors in your wardrobe are not evenly distributed. And that makes a lot of sense as you see the colors distributed in the actual clothing that builds up your wardrobe. Now, as you can see here, I've got a simple wardrobe of just 25 items. And while a guy that doesn't understand wardrobe interchangeability may be able to get five to 10 outfits from all this clothing, you on the other hand understand that this is a multiplication game. Well, assuming 100% interchangeability, you've got over 1,250 outfits. And if we assume there's not perfect interchangeability that you maybe only like 10% of those outfits, still you'd have 125 to choose from, which is pretty darn good if you think about it. Now, before I get into putting some of these combinations together for you, well, first I want to make it easy for you if you're in the market to start building your interchangeable wardrobe. Yeah, where to buy a lot of this clothing? Well, gents, look no further than today's sponsor, Collars & Co. Gents, for years, I've been talking about collars and cooks. I love what these guys are doing. When you get over to their website, you are going to see clothing that's designed in a classic style using state-of-the-art comfortable materials that make it easy for you to dress sharp for you to look good. Now, when I first started talking about collars and coat, it was all about their dress collar polo. This is what put these guys on the map when they showed up on Shark Tank and they got Mark Cuban to invest a million dollars into their company because they solve that common problem of so many guys that want to layer, but they don't want to wear an uncomfortable dress shirt underneath, but they need that structure collar which wasn't common with the average polo. Well, the guys in collar and coat understood this and they solved the problem by creating the dress collar polo. All of a sudden, you're layering it with the sweater, you're able to throw a blazer or a sports jacket right on top of it, or as you can see here, we're all three at the same time. And in my opinion, they got one of the best selections of knitwear you're going to find out there anywhere for a man that wants to be able to layer his clothing and look good. Seriously, look at all the different options when it comes to quarter zips, all the different textures, colors, and different styles of sweaters they've got there for you. And yes, they've also got performance blazers. Right here, I'm wearing the Maverick blazer. It's incredibly comfortable. It's made from a stretch material that's anti-wrinkle that actually has a really nice drape to it. In fact, this blazer right here is machine washable. But, gents, if you're looking through collars and coats website and you don't know where to start, my advice would still be the dress collar polo. And when it comes to their collars, you've got options whether you're looking for a semi-spread English spread button down collar or a cutaway collar. But let's keep it simple. I'm going to recommend if you just get started, check out their original dress collar polo. If you pick up this polo in white, it's going to become those versatile shirt in your wardrobe because not only is it comfortable made from performance fabric with a four-way stretch, but it's also moisture-working. And, again, these collars you can wear them with a necktie, you can choose to wear them open like I do. So, as always, get the best deal on the web. Gents, I take care of you. Use that link in the description of today's video. Go over to collars and coat. Check it out. Down below, gents, use that link. It's going to get you the best deal on the web. Boom, right there. Now, before I get into the outfits and those color combinations, let's talk about the 25 items. What are we working with here? So, first up, let's start with the foundation of a man's wardrobe, the five pairs of shoes. We got black leather boots, brown brogues, dark brown suede chukkas, white leather sneakers, and black Chelsea boots. Next up, five pairs of trousers. We got a pair of trousers and charcoal gray wool. Next up, we've got some navy chinos, dark denim jeans, olive chinos, and beige corduroy. Our shirts, two polos, one in white, one in navy. Next up, we have a white and a light blue Oxford button down. We've got a cream handling and a slate blue flannel shirt. We're also throwing in a navy hoodie. Now, these next four aren't technically shirts, but I'm going to keep them in this category anyway. So, this is going to include a navy Henley, a black crew neck sweater, a burgundy v-neck sweater, and a charcoal gray turtleneck. The jackets here are going to be a navy blazer, an olive green field jacket, a camel overcoat, a charcoal gray p-coat, and a navy quarter zip sweater. So, we're going to start this off with casual outfits. So, the first cool weather color combination I think every guy needs to know. We've got the white polo with dark jeans, white leather sneakers, and the olive field jacket. Now, what I like about this outfit is it's clean and approachable. It's ideal for a casual gathering or just going out on the weekend. Next up, we've got the cream Henley with the beige corduroy pants plus the dark brown chakas. And, again, let's throw in that olive field jacket. Rugged, earthy, but urban, something you could wear in the city just meet not some friends for coffee. It conveys that you're easygoing, you're warm, and you're stylish. Next up, we got the navy polo with those navy chinos plus the white leather sneakers and the navy quarter zip sweater on top. A monochromatic look that's separated by the textures of the materials, the white sneakers keep it casual, but the overall monochromatic look makes it something you could wear even out to dinner. Next up, we've got the slate blue flannel shirt with the olive chinos with the black leather boots and camel overcoat. This is a mix of rugged and refined, a play with the colors for a casual evening or an autumn stroll. The flannel adds warmth, adds a bit of casualness, but the overcoat elevates the overall outfit. Next up, we got the burgundy v-neck with the dark denim jeans and the brown brogues. Casual, yet rich in color and a sophisticated overall feel perfect for a laid-back dinner or a creative work setting. Next up, we've got the white Oxford button down plus the beige corduroy pants plus the black Chelsea boots and then the charcoal pico. The look is actually pretty versatile and that pico just brings it all together. Next up, the charcoal gray turtleneck plus the navy chinos and the dark brown suede chukkas. Sleek and sophisticated suitable for an art gallery or a cozy night out with your day. And, you guys know me, I love a refined turtleneck. Next up, let's take that navy hoodie with the olive chinos and throw in those white leather sneakers. A comfortable, practical, effortless look for just hanging out with friends on the weekend or running around town doing errands. Next up, we've got the white polo with the charcoal gray wool trousers, the black Chelsea boots and the navy quarter zip sweater. Sporty meets classic here. You can wear this into the office or you could wear it out to a casual dinner. The black crew neck sweater, the dark denim, the black boots and the olive feel jacket. Casual timeless, this is perfect for the afternoons for the evenings when you're just out running around getting things done or if you need to pop into work on the weekend. The navy polo plus the dark denim jeans plus those black leather boots and the charcoal pico. A bold sleek option for work or just an evening out. The cream henley, the olive chinos and the brown brooks. Warm approachable, ideal for a brunch or a relaxed gathering. The burgundy v-neck plus the olive chinos plus the dark brown chukkas plus the olive feel jacket. Earthy and grounded, you can wear this to a casual party or casual dinner. Next up, we've got a white collared polo layered with the burgundy v-neck. Pairing that with the charcoal gray wool trousers, the black Chelsea boots and a navy blazer on top. Clean classic and layered. Perfect for a smart casual setting, maybe we could even throw a silk neck tie-in with this combination here. On a cool winter day, this would be great for a presentation or going out to a fancy dinner. Next up, we've got the light blue Oxford plus the navy chinos plus the dark brown suede chukkas and the camel overcoat. Soft polish, you can wear this when you're walking through the city or going out on a date. The charcoal gray turtleneck with the beige corduroy pants. The black Chelsea boots and the charcoal P-coat. Understated, sophisticated. Perfect for headed to a museum, the gallery or just the evening out. Next up, we've got the navy polo with the charcoal gray trousers with a pair of brown brogues and the navy blazer. A polished blend of sporty and sophisticated. You can wear this to an afternoon meeting or presentation at work or a fancy dinner out with friends in the city. Next we've got the white Oxford button down plus the olive chinos, the dark brown chukkas and the camel overcoat on top. Clean grounded a use of earthy colors. This has a sophisticated yet approachable feel to it. All right. So, I put together some other combinations here as you can see.

        "transcript": " What the hell have I got myself into? So, that was the subject of an email the other day I got from a guy trying to improve his style. I'm in my early forties recently divorced and I'm back out there dating. I describe myself as fashion impaired. Antonio, you've got all this information, but where do I start? And, you know, he had a good point because whether you're 16, 36, or 60, you want to walk out your door looking good. But, does that mean you always have to wear a suit? Always have to wear a collared shirt? Do all your shoes have to be fancy and have a shine to them? Well, the answer is no, no, and no. So, how to develop a sense of style when you're fashion impaired? Gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video. So, first up, you need to answer the question why the hell are you doing this? Know your why? Understand your purpose for getting dressed in the image you want to send with your clothing. So, the 22-year-old out there starting a new career in the big city. As an ISU grad, your heart may be back in Ames, Iowa, but your clothing as you slip into the finance industry there in Chicago needs to say I'm ready to do business. I'm the kind of guy you want to train up to be able to close multi-million dollar deals. For the 36-year-old changing careers, now you're starting your own blue collar business? Well, it's time for you to maybe give up the suit, but still have a uniform that instills trust in the people you're trying to sell your services to. So, the newly single 50-year-old out there, yeah, life is dealt to a tough hand. You didn't expect to be dating at this age, but you know what? You're going to give it a shot and you know that, hey, I want to be approachable. So, all of a sudden, you start getting into sweaters. You're going to use this fall weather to your advantage and pull out the cashmere because you know it's irresistible. It's like catnip to the ladies when you're out and about. Seriously, everyone loves a textured sweater especially like a nice wool or a cashmere and whenever somebody touches you, they instantly feel closer to you. In any case, the point here, gents, understand why you're improving your style and dress accordingly. Step number two, fit first everything else later. Seriously, I've got my style pyramid. We talk about fit function and fabric, but if I have to put these in order of the most important, I've already got formula on this, fit is going to be the item that you need to focus in on first because, gents, you can go out there and spend $2,000 on a suit and guess what? If it doesn't fit you, it's not going to look good. Now, of course, if you've got the budget, buy a really nice fabric, pay attention to construction, but fit, fit, fit has to happen first. Gents, stop wearing a tent, tailor up. In fact, know the name of your tailor because guess what? Your casual clothing, even your jeans, take those and get them adjusted to fit you better. Any type of button-down shirt, any type of jacket, any type of sweater could actually be brought in and this is especially important if you spend time at the gym. If you've got a good body, make sure your clothing is showing that off. Now, at this point, some of you guys are seeing Antonia. You talked about spending $2,000 on a suit. I don't got that. And I 100% understand that which is why I'm proud to bring you today's sponsor Cloud Style. Guys, go over on Amazon, yes, and check out these suits, less than $100 for a full 3P suit. Now, I want to be 100% transparent. There is a big difference between a $1,000 suit and a $100 suit. Gents, the suit I am wearing right now in this video was sent to me by Cloud Style and it fits and looks good. And that's where I love where we're at today with today's modern tailoring. You're able to get a decent suit at an incredibly affordable price that you can use in a variety of situations. But, what I like about this company is they like to have fun. Look at all these different styles, look at all these different colors out there, which I get it. For the vast majority of you guys, this is not going to be your style. But for a guy that likes color, a guy that likes a little bit of flash, man, you could put together a combination here that, again, is going to turn heads. And when I talked about this company earlier this year, I talked about how their trousers have a really nice stretch side tab to them so they're really easy to fit a wide variety of different sizes. But, if you're looking for a company to get a flashy suit to get something that's a little bit more fun, maybe for your wedding or for a party you're going to, you want everyone to match, you want to have a little bit of fun, you want to be the group of guys going out that everyone is looking at, then do it. Cloud Style is a company that makes affordable suits for guys that want to stand out for guys that want to have fun. Again, gents, use that link, go check them out. The best suit deal you will find on the planet. Seriously, you're not going to find anything cheaper than this and again, you get it adjusted to fit you. It's going to come out looking good. The next step, gents, is to go from chaos to class. So, start with an interchangeable core wardrobe. So, by an interchangeable core wardrobe, you are looking to pick up 12 items. It's going to be three pairs of shoes, three trousers, three shirts, and three jackets. Now, of course, you can mix and match this if you've already got a couple items that you can fit in there. Now, the goal here is for you to have three solid outfits with all 12 of those items. See how it goes right across, three, three, three, and three? But because these items are interchangeable, that means that they are going to work with each other. Instead of three outfits here, we actually have 81 outfits because everything is 100% mixable, meaning that every pair of trousers works with every pair of shoes, works with every shirt, works with every jacket. So, with a minimal spend of resources, you could fit everything into a weekender bag right here. And then, you would have enough outfits to wear a different outfit every day for almost three months. And then, you're just simply using math to look good and to put together different combinations. And the rest of the world, they just think you're stylish, which in a sense even though you didn't think it was possible, you have now become. Now, step number four, I probably could have put this one earlier, but I assume that you already have inspiration. I'm imagining that you already have an image of how you would like to look, or at least you've seen men in movies, you've seen them on pictures over on Instagram that are dressing in a way that you want to emulate. Now, this step right here makes some guys a little bit uncomfortable because they're thinking, hey, I don't really want to imitate, I want to make it mine, but here's the deal. Even if you tried to exactly copy the looks of Idris Elba, Ryan Gosling, Austin Butler, Timothy Chalamet or however you pronounce his last name, Timothy Chalamet, even if you tried to copy their looks exactly, you still wouldn't be able to get it. And the value with this is that they've got high paid stylists that are out there putting all these outfits together. You are just simply being a fast follower. And because men's style in general especially classic style moves so slowly, there were looks that were made 40 or 50 years ago, they're still being worn today. Well, guess what? Nobody's going to notice except they're going to notice you looking good. Step number five, nail your grooming. In a nutshell, here's the handsome devil's grooming arsenal. First up, your hair cut. Go ahead and cheat on your Barbie. You've been going to the same guy for 10 years, 20 years, maybe just for a couple of years, but go out there and find the best stylist in your area and see what she has to say about a style that's going to suit you. So first up, you don't have to take her advice, but the reality is she's probably seen more hairstyles, more heads than yeah, you will ever see. Because a lot of guys, you're on it, you get it. You're cutting your own hair, maybe you're going to the same person that doesn't see. You want to go to the best. And what they're going to do is they're going to look at your head shape. They're going to look, they're going to know the latest styles. They're going to know your hair type and they're going to be able to give you some suggestions and try something new because guess what? You can always go back to a shorter version of your old classic hairstyle. But I'll tell you this one step right here can totally change your look, get you instant compliments and it's something, again, that will take a matter of minutes and will have you feeling better. And yes, you know, jam you. I love going to the gym, but that's going to take months to have an effect. Going to a stylist, you can have your look amazing within an hour. And at the same time, don't be afraid to ask for some facial hair advice especially if you've got a little bit of a longer beard. Yes, you've been maybe doing this all yourself and go see a professional who has seen tons of beards. You may have to travel a little bit farther for facial hair advice, but guys, it's worth it because whenever you get that insight, whenever you get that new, you know, facial hair cream all of a sudden it changes the look and you all of a sudden are loving the way it makes you feel. Next up, let's talk about your nails both on your hands and your feet. Go get a manicure. Go get a pedicure especially if you bite your nails. Now, a lot of guys think this is an extravagance, but here's the thing. If you bite your nails, you get a manicure, you are not going to bite your nails anymore because you just spent good money taking care of your nails. Now, when it comes to skincare, tons of options out there, but most men don't exercise any of them. First up, stop using bar soap on your face. It's too harsh. You want to use a face cleanser. It's going to be gentler and it's something that you can use in the morning and at night. Next up, a couple times a week, use an exfoliator. This is going to remove dead skin cells. Really important if you're over the age of 30. Next up, use a daily moisturizers. moisturizers are going to not only protect the skin and moisturize them, but if you're over the age of 40, it's going to give it a little bit more supple of a look, a little bit more energy. And finally, don't forget the importance of fragrance. As you guys, if you've seen my channel, you know, guys, I'm a fragrance addict. But, I will tell you, you don't need to go crazy here. One or two sprays, it's better to be discovered than announce yourself when you go into a room. Look for something simple, classic, walk into a box store, find something that suits you, but if you're looking for something that's going to attract the ladies, go with maybe a vanilla if you want something to wear for yourself. Maybe find something that's a little bit more old school barbershop aromatic. Next up, let's talk about how to go from boring to badass. And, guys, that is just simply understand the power of accessories. So, a simple blue suit like this with the white shirt, but what did you notice? That white, yeah, that presidential fold pocket square right there, that's a small, very subtle accessory. Another thing you may have noticed, I was wearing a watch, this is, you know, a skeleton. Now, the reality is these accessories are not very expensive. This watch, a couple of hundred bucks, this accessory actually came with the jacket. But, these small details make a big difference. There's the little things that catch the eye, the little things that people just noticed they pay attention to the flash, to the shine. And for some people who are looking to make conversation be able to talk, it's something it's a starting point. It's something that they pay attention to especially if they're into watches, if they're into style. Most guys don't put a pocket square in there, so immediately they're going to say, oh, wow, I like the way it works with the shirt. Sunglasses, belts, bags, all those things you want to make sure especially if you're just getting started, I like to match leathers with leathers, but they can also complement especially I wear an oxblood shoe, I'm not going to wear an oxblood belt, I'll wear a black belt because the sole on oxblood shoes is black, you see how that works. Point being is don't neglect your accessories, they are end points. We notice them, we pay attention to them, we give them a little bit more emphasis than we probably should. So, knowing this, use it to your advantage and make sure that you pay attention to them and that you pick up quality good-looking accessories. Now, this next tip to developing a sense of style if you are fashion impaired is really important because you can listen to everything we talked about in this video and it won't make a difference unless you put this into practice. Seriously, you need to practice dressing sharp. You can own the clothing, you can understand and have the information, but unless you take action on it, absolutely nothing is going to happen. But when you start wearing the clothing, even around the house when you have nowhere to go just simply running errands around town, you're going to find that you're going to become more comfortable in the clothing. It's going to become a second skin. It's going to be normal for you to start dressing better, dressing with style. And, again, this applies to casual clothing. When you get rid of the worn out t-shirts and you bring in some nice Henleys, bring in a pair of joggers, some clean white sneakers. The thing is you got to get comfortable, you got to get used to dressing the way you want to dress, the way you've got this new improved image. And when you do this, all of a sudden opportunity is going to start coming your way because you're not going to notice that you've stepped up your style. It's going to become who you are, it's going to become your new normal. And gents, when that happens, when you step out and you're actually wearing maybe the older clothing you used to, you know, like, man, I feel under dressed, guess what? The day has arrived, you now have style, you now have a sense of fashion. So, pretty good, right? All right, guys, keep watching. I got another video for you right here, boom. Go check it out, solid video. Guys, I know I take care of you here at Real Men Real Style. So, go check it out. Come on, boom, right there. Oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " A quarter of an inch, 6.35 millimeters. That's about the width of the microphone part on your AirPods. The width of 65 sheets of paper, the width of a case of a relatively thin watch. So, believe it or not, that small amount makes a big difference when choosing the right belt for your jeans. You see, dress belts made to be worn with dress pants are on average 1.25 inches in width. More casual belts, the type meant to be worn with jeans come in at 1.5 to 1.75 inches in width. The next mistake is always matching your belt color with your shoes. Now, the majority of the time, you do want to follow this rule of matching leathers with leathers. However, if you're wearing a shoe in non-traditional color such as white, gray, green, or even a multi-color shoe, in this case, you've got a couple options. First up, of course, you can try to match the shoes although this doesn't always look good with every color especially white, but a better option here is to find a belt color that complements the outfit. Notice here even with the light-colored shoes, I went with a darker belt that creates a more monochromatic look with the denim. And here's the same principle with light-colored denim, dark shoes. Notice how that belt just blends in. Now, visually, the reason this works is we keep the leg line intact. We don't have a high contrast color drawing any attention to the midsection. And because the belt is similar in color to the denim, it actually lengthens the leg line because it doesn't break up the trousers and allows our eyes to go up and down. Which, by the way, is a great look for a lot of shorter guys who in general have shorter legs and a longer torso proportionally. The next mistake is choosing the wrong belt material. Now, a shiny black or dark brown formal looks good whenever you're dressing up. But with denim especially casual jeans, now, in this case, you want to go with a leather or a material that's a little bit more casual. So, first up, the color with denim especially if we're keeping it casual, you've got a wide variety of browns that are going to work with this. You, of course, can go with a black belt. Maybe choose a black belt that has a matte finish or a little bit of pebble or textured feel to it. Swades are a great option when it comes to denim. They've got the texture and they can be dressed up, dressed down, and they usually come in a wide variety of colors. Another option with denim is canvas. What I like about canvas is it comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns and it stands up relatively well to wear and tear. The next mistake is wearing a belt that's falling apart, a belt that's worn out. Now, gents, if you want to level up your style, you don't want to make the mistake of confusing casual with sloppy. When it comes to casual style, a lot of guys make the mistake of when they dress down, they allow worn out stained torn clothing pieces to fall into these outfits. And although in some cases, distressed clothing can have an appeal to it, if it's not planned, it's just your worn out belt, it really can detract from the overall outfit. So, yeah, upgrade your casual belt, don't fall into this trap. Now, gents, today's video is brought to you by Anson Belt and Buckle. For over a decade, I've been wearing and loving Anson Belt and Buckle and talking about these guys because of their unique micro adjust system. So, with an Anson belt, you can adjust the fit of your belt down to a quarter of an inch. Gents, that's a big improvement from those belts that use holes because those type of belts can only adjust to the inch. On top of that, when you're just talking about wear and tear, you usually get that crease that bend right in the belt with just after a few wears. With Anson Belt and Buckle and that micro adjust system, you not get that crease point on the belt. And, in fact, I've got belts in my collection that I've worn for years that still look amazing. And speaking of looking amazing, get over to their website, gents, and look at all the different straps, all the different buckles that you've got available for you. And what I love about Anson Belt and Buckle is that their straps are interchangeable with their buckles. So, when you go over and you grab, let's say, their box set and you pick up three buckles, you get two straps or you can go with two buckles and three straps. But, at the end of the day, you can create six different belts from that. They've got the interchangeable belt system. And I love how Anson Belt and Buckle makes that possible. And in case you're wondering, their belts and their buckles come in either 1.25 dress belts or 1.5-inch more casual style belts. So, they've got you covered to whether you want a dress belt for your dress pants or if you want a casual belt for denim. And on top of all that, let's talk about customer service. It is legendary. I remember one guy talked about how he cut his strap a little bit too short. He made a mistake, he reached out to Anson Belt and Buckle and asked just to be able to purchase another strap. And, Dave, the owner said, don't worry about it, I will send you out a free strap, no charge. And, gents, that's the kind of company that I love to introduce you guys to, one that takes care of its customers. And, of course, has a great product. So, to get started, gents, go over to Anson Belt and Buckle. Use that link in the description of today's video for the best deal you're going to find on the web.

I know the founders, this is a great American company. Go check them out. Anson Belt and Buckle, use the link below to get the best deal on the web. So, we talked about what not to do when it comes to matching your belt with jeans. But, what are the basic rules? What are the foundations? How to make sure when you style a belt with jeans, you always look good? Well, rule number one here is to be intentional to remember that a belt is an accessory. The goal of accessories are to enhance your outfit to make you look better. So, don't be throwing on your belt as just an afterthought. For most men, they think of the belt as nothing more than a functional accessory. But, for you, the guy that's going to be the best dress man in the room, we want the belt to be something that enhances your overall look. So, your best bet here is to give yourself options. Have casual belts and have dress belts. Maybe look for belts as I talked about that have a belt system where you can actually change out the buckles. But, if that's not your thing, at least give yourself some options when it comes to choices and your piecing outfits together. Now, my general rule for how many belts I think a man should own, it really depends on the number of shoes he has. If you've got six pairs of shoes, I think that you should have six belt options. Now, if you're a shoe monster and you got more than 10 pairs, you can cut back on that a bit. But, if you only got a couple pairs of shoes, I don't think it's a problem to have three or four belts in that case. Now, the next step to always make sure you're styling your belt with your jeans correctly is to graduate from the thinking that you have to always match your leathers with leathers. If you have black shoes, you do not always have to wear a black belt. And, Tony, are you saying if I'm wearing brown shoes, I can wear a black belt? Now, gents, all I'm saying is that you have options and to be intentional in your choice. Now, in general, when it comes to dark brown or black shoes, I do like to match leathers with leathers. I think that they just complement best that way. But, the reality is when it comes to casual footwear, we don't always have a belt that matches exactly. And, in that case, you can choose to get close. I can either go with a same color suede as this, I could go with a little bit darker, a little bit lighter. And, because the soles right here are this dark color, I could even go with a belt in that color right there. Or maybe the case of a white sneaker like this, I decide I don't want my belt at all to match this. Or go with the design and color that completely stands out, contradicts everything. But, again, I've made that style choice with intention. So, now, you know my nuanced opinion on leathers matching leathers, but an area that I'm not going to bend on is formalities matching formalities. So, these boots right here, if I'm looking for a belt to go with these, it should be a casual belt. Why? These boots because of their lug sole because of their overall work design, these are casual boots. This shoe, on the other hand, is a classic Oxford dress shoe. It's got a closed lacing system. This is meant to be worn with a casual suit or a dressed up business suit. Therefore, the belt that these shoes call for is going to be black and it's going to be a dress belt only. Now, the right belt choice in those scenarios was pretty clear, but there are going to be options out there whenever you're piecing together outfits that's going to be a little bit uncertain. In that case, this is when you get to bring in your personal style, your personal choice. This pair of shoes right here, yes, you could wear this with a casual suit and a dark brown dress belt or you could dress this down with denim, a polo, either a brown canvas suede or leather belt. Now, we talked about materials briefly, but I want to make this really simple for you guys. So, I created a clear chart right here. As you can see, the highest level of formality is going to be in a dark color and is going to be a clean smooth leather. Now, of course, you can substitute leather for other materials, but what we have here is a streamlined clean simple 1.25 inch with dress belt as the highest level of formality. Then, at this level is made to be worn with a suit. But, going down very quickly, we're going to find that most belts on this list can actually be worn with denim especially if you're dressing it up. And a lot of these materials especially with the matte finish in a variety of different colors, different overall looks and feels, these more casual looks which actually make up the majority of belts out there are going to work really well with a wide variety of denim. And the key here to making sure they work is to actually get the right width and is we're about to get into the right buckle. So, the most formal type of buckle style is going to be the frame style buckle. Simple, elegant, it's been around for hundreds of years and this is the simple style we're going to see on most men's dress belts. Now, that being said, the frame style belt can be casual especially if they start to use a thicker heavier type of material and design. And you will see a variety of frame style belts out there and are going to have intricate designs built into them. Now, on the flip side, the most casual style of belt buckles we're going to see out there are going to be the ring style both the O and the D ring, the common styles we see out there and the plate style buckle. Now, the plate style buckle is usually heavier. This is where we're going to see a lot of decorative western buckles made in this style. And the history of plate style buckles go back hundreds of years, but they were made popular by the Vicaros who came out of Mexico in the 16 and 1700s and where they're precursor to the modern cowboy. These horsemen had love for shiny accessories. They were often engraved with stories, legends, and reminders of their exploits. Now, again, the right choice of buckle depends on you and the outfit you're trying to style. Now, a more modern type of buckle is going to be the box frame buckle. This style in general has been around for over a hundred years and depending on how it's styled, it can be dressed up or it can be dressed down. As to which style is going to best suit you, again, give yourself options and it really depends on what is going to complement your casual or maybe a little bit more dressed up outfit. Now, at the beginning of this video, we talked about specific measurements. In general, dress belts are 1.25 inches in diameter. Casual belts from 1.5 to about 1.75 inches in diameter. Viercia belt that's 2 inches or more in diameter, most likely this is going to be a work belt. Belts of this design are usually made to be able to have things strapped onto them and are made that thick to be able to better support weight. Now, what about belts that are really thin? We're talking one inch or less in diameter. Well, I have to say outside of costumes, I don't really see that in menswear. We do see occasionally belts like that pop up in the women's side and they're usually more decorative belts meant to cinch, but I find that thinner belts like this just are incredibly uncomfortable. So, yeah, don't even bother never pick up a belt like that. It's probably not made to be worn how you think it is. Now, what about when you're tightening up a belt? How much excessive length should you have on a belt and if you've got more than this, should you cut it off, should you get it adjusted? Well, the first part of that question is about 2 to 4 inches. In my opinion, that's about the perfect length. Anything past 4 inches kind of gets in the way. Anything less than 2 inches doesn't give you enough room to adjust especially if you have a good Thanksgiving meal. So, does that mean if you've got 5 inches or more of excess material hanging off that you should get that cut? Well, the short answer is you probably should have bought a belt that was a bit smaller, but if you do happen to have a belt and yes, it's got, you know, 8 inches of excess material, you can probably take that into a cobbler and he could recut the end or you could possibly do it yourself. I mean, don't set the expectations. I maybe watch a few tutorials on YouTube, but yeah, good luck and I'm not guaranteed anything. So, what about the rest of the outfit? Your jeans with your shoes, guys, I got you covered. Boom. With this video right here, I explain it all, I make it simple. I got you covered. Yeah, right here. Check it out. There you go. Boom."

        "transcript": " What's up, gents? Antonio here. Now, as a lot of you guys know for Real Men Real Style, we have made a ton of videos talking about the science style professional presentation mixing in military history. And, as many of you guys have noticed, I've made a lot of videos on fragrance and my personal collection has blown to probably over 700 bottles. Yeah, I admit I'm a bit of an addict. Now, that being said, what you probably didn't know is how I became obsessed with fragrances. In fact, that story I think is even more interesting because I didn't even wear fragrances before 2017. But, before I get into that, I need to go even farther back. So, let's go back to 2007. As many of you guys know, I graduated with an MBA from the University of Texas. I spent five years in the United States Marine Corps before that. But, interestingly, my first love was actually science. I was that weird kid that would read science news and scientific papers. And during my undergrad years at Cornell College, I picked up a BA in Origins of Behavior, which was a mix of psychology and biology. Now, I share this with you because if you know anything about real men, real style, you also know we have a website. And over the last 15 years, I've done a ton of research trying to bring to light the scientific research that I find supporting the importance of personal presentation. Well, over the years, I kept stumbling on and I kept finding all of these papers talking about the importance of scent, the science of smell and how it affected human behavior. Now, as a guy that didn't wear a daily fragrance, I thought, you know what? If you shower, if you're clean, you're going to be fine. But, I kept finding all this compelling data about how certain scents actually affect mental performance. Certain smells have been shown to improve focus, enhance memory. Just like you, I'm a busy guy. Seven kids, five businesses, and a wife I like to spend time with. Yeah, as you can imagine, those things take up a lot of time and energy. And it was because of those constraints, I was pretty much at wit's end that it finally hit me and I started paying attention to the potential of all this research. I thought, what if you can use scent to hijack the olfactory system to control the way you feel? Simply put, what if the fragrance I wore could help me get more out of my day? Now, if you think about it, scent affecting your mindset isn't anything new. Now, for most people to smell a coffee, freshly baked bread, the smell of a fresh cut orange or lemon, all of these scents evoke conditioned feelings. By that, I mean you've accidentally associated that feeling with that smell. But, what if you could actually harness the scent conditioning? What if you could create scent triggers that would evoke the feelings you want on command? Literally fragrances that could put you in the state of mind that you want. So, being curious, I went out there and bought a ton of fragrances. And I'll tell you, almost everything out there is focused on sex appeal, which nothing wrong with that, but that's not what I was looking for. I wanted to find fragrances that could help enhance your concentration, a scent that could be used to improve mental clarity, a fragrance that when you put it on, you feel more confident. Well, as you can probably guess, I never found those fragrances. Now, being an obsessive entrepreneur, I went out there and created them. Gents, it took me two years and over $250,000 in development costs. I was able to create mission fragrances. Gents, the concept of mission fragrances is to have your core values in a fragrance set. Honor, courage, and commitment. These fragrances were developed to help you become your best self. When you wear these fragrances, you become an honorable man, a man that lives by his own code, a courageous man who has the strength to meet life's challenges, a man with commitment who understands what his glorious purpose is and takes steps towards it. Gents, what you have at mission fragrances is the world's first scent triggers leveraging the science of operant conditioning to help you feel more confident, more focused, more like your best self. The mission fragrance set, honor, courage, commitment. These scent triggers are designed to help you become the man you know yourself to be. Oh, and on a side note, they smell really good. Every time you wear these things, you are going to get compliments. The fragrances are designed to be very different, but they complement each other and work with the seasons, work for day or evening wear. They're incredibly versatile and have great longevity. Come on, I'm a frag hit. I know what the people want. But, seriously, gents, I designed the mission fragrance set for the man that wants more out of life, but needs just a little bit of help getting there. So, to find out if mission fragrances are right for you, go to missionfragments.com to learn more. And, gents, because everyone that grabs a mission fragrance set gets access to the Mission Fragrances Academy which teaches you exactly how to use the fragrance and is a full-on self-development course. So, because of that reason, we've only got a limited number of sets available for sale. So, again, gents, to claim your set, go over to missionfragments.com today."

        "transcript": " So, in 1925, approximately 35 million hats were produced in the United States. Per the US population at that time period, that comes out to approximately one hat per man per year. The popular hats at the time were the Fedora, the Hamburg, the Boller, the Newsboy, the Straw Boater and the Panama. Gents, it's safe to say if you were to go outside during that time period, you would not see a man out walking around without a hat. In fact, Joe Rogan and Theo Vaughn were just talking about this over on their podcast about how hats were everywhere. It didn't matter if you're rich, poor, dressing down, dressing up, when you walked out of your house, you had a hat on. Fast forward 50 years to the 1970s, the total US population has more than doubled. But, the number of hats being sold in this country, well under 2 million. Walking around during this decade, you're lucky to see one in a hundred men wearing a hat. So, what happened in the span of less than half a century? Why did men abandon no trilobies and fedoras? Were hats a fashion trend that just fell out of style or were hats a casualty of a cultural shift? And then, the answer to these questions is actually in this picture right here. Do you see it? Well, don't worry, gents, if it's not obvious, it will be by the end of this video as we dive into solving the mystery of why did men stop wearing hats? Now, to understand the decline of hats, we first have to understand the rise. Why did men start wearing hats to begin with? Now, for thousands of years, men and women have used hats both to protect themselves and as a sign of social status. But starting in the 1700s, for men, this became uniform across Europe and the United States. In the form of the bicorn and the tricorn hat, favored by the military, favored by wealthy men and men that worked outdoors, the bicorn and the tricorn hat was a relatively easy to produce and very functional piece of headwear that protected the wearer's head from the elements and kept them warm. And this needs to be emphasized because in the modern world today, we don't spend much time outdoors. But go back just a hundred years, the majority of men worked outdoors. And if you travel during the day like most people did, you were going to be exposed to the sun. And you were exposed to the sun for a long time, sometimes hours at a time. So, protecting the head was important. Now, tricorn and bicorn hats were made from a variety of different materials and a man was able to show office status by the material the hat was made of and occasionally decorative accessories and details sewn and built into the headwear. By the 1800s, the buy in the tricorn hats are out and we see the rise of the top hat, which by the way, this hat is still worn at certain occasions in various parts of the world. So, if you look at the rise of the top hat, the rise of the top hat is a big shift in population densities going from rural areas to the cities. Basically, during the 18th century, the industrialization age, we see people migrating from farms to the cities for factory work. Those that were fortunate or maybe cunning, devious, however you want to describe enough to make it to the top wanted to be able to show off that wealth in that status in the way they dressed and the top hat became very popular especially in larger cities like New York, London, Chicago, and Paris. And the bowler, by the way, emerged in this time period as a more practical day-to-day wear hat. By the 1880s and 1890s, as more and more men started to earn more money than they had ever earned and because of still the practical need of headwear and its social status, in the year 1900, we saw the peak of hat sales at over 42 million in a single year. Just giving an idea of that number, that was more than the male adult population. So, with 1.4 hats being sold for every man, we saw a number of different styles start to emerge like the Fedora, the Hamburg, the Newsboy, and the Flat Cap. So, by the 1920s, it's safe to say we have reached peak hat. The average man has anywhere from three to five hats in his wardrobe and no self-respecting guy would ever leave his home without one on his head. So, what happened? Now, gents, before I make the big reveal, I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Lyfan and their high-speed hairdryer. Now, the Lyfan Swift special, what you see right here is the best hairdryer on the market. So, first up, it dries your hair fast, it dries your hair safely. As you know, when you want your hair to have volume, when you want to be able to shape it, you want to be able to use a hairdryer that's using a bit of heat. However, too much heat can damage your hair and that's why I love the Lyfan Swift special. It's got a built-in smart temperature control. It's making sure a hundred times a second it's optimized at the right temperature for your hair. In addition, this thing is quiet and I absolutely love it because it doesn't make a whole lot of noise first thing in the morning. And with an airspeed of over 20 meters a second, this thing is strong. It's going to dry your hair three times faster than a regular hairdryer. All of that from a brushless motor that's designed to have a 1000-hour lifespan. On top of that, you got three different nozzles. And gents, to make this offer irresistible, if you grab a Lyfan high-speed hairdryer, you will get a Lyfan wave electric toothbrush absolutely free. I love this toothbrush. I use this toothbrush especially when I'm traveling. I love how it's got a long-lasting battery, it's relatively small. Not only does it vibrate, but it oscillates going back and forth. Basically, it makes sure you effectively brush your teeth even if you got poor brushing technique, which is actually a big deal because it cleans your teeth while protecting the gums. So, gents, if you're ready to step up your grooming game, if you want your hair looking good, if you want your teeth looking good, both of these products are frigging amazing. I use them, highly recommend them. And right now, you can get a two for one just by using that link in the description of today's video. So, go check it out. Take advantage of this deal, guys. It's a great one. So, what happened to that? Why did men stop wearing it? Why did sales plummet? Now, based off my research, I've got five reasons right here. Let's go through and break them out. Now, this first reason was a shift in demographics specifically where we are spending our time. The reality is from 1870 to 1970, the amount of men spending time outside, it completely flipped in terms of percentages. In 1870, a man would spend 10 to 14 hours outdoors. In 1970, he was spending on average less than an hour. The big shift here was from rural, farm work, to men moving to the cities having factory jobs having service jobs and the rise of the white collar industry. As men spent more and more time indoors, they realized and they stopped buying the headwear that would protect them when they were outside in the elements. Now, understand this was a gradual process. Men are creatures of habit. If you had been wearing a hat for the first 20 to 30 years of your adult life, most likely you continued that habit, you just had less opportunities to wear it. But, it's that new generation we need to pay attention to especially the baby boomers. We had a huge surge in new births from 1945 to the 1950s. All of these new young men entering the workforce in the late 1960s and 70s, for them there is no habit attachment to wearing a hat and they were quick to abandon it. And that takes us right into the youth culture, rebellion, the changing of fashion. It's safe to say in the 1960s, we saw a cultural revolution. From the rise of Elvis Presley to the rise of the Beatles. From the mods to the hippies to the counterculture rebellion, post-war generations did not want to associate themselves with their parents. They wanted something different. One of the biggest ways to be able to separate yourself from your father was to stop looking like your father. Tons of young men started to reject the conservative dress code. They wanted to dress in a manner that they felt was more suited to them, but not even realizing it, they were falling into the 1960s and 1970s fashion trends. On top of that, let's talk about cultural icons. So, JFK was noted, yes, he occasionally wore a hat, but JFK pretty much did not wear a hat in most appearances to include his inauguration which was a very cold, chilly day in DC, but the guy still, he just wore his jacket up there, did not wear a hat. And this moment captured on television seen by tons of young idealistic men was basically a nail in the coffin of headwear. And again, JFK wasn't the only cultural icon. As Hollywood became more popular especially with the younger crowds, we see guys like Marlon Brando, James Dean, and other silver screen heroes looking stylish, looking cool, all without anything on their heads. Now, for this next point, let's go back to that picture I showed you earlier. I said it would become obvious. One of the cultural shifts, one of the habits that is seen as a culprit when it comes to the demise of the hat. Do you see it now? Gentlemen, it's the rise of the automobile. So, funny enough when cars were first manufactured, they didn't have roofs and there wasn't an issue to be able to wear your top hat right there on the car. But as cars became more popular in the 1920s, 1930s, all of a sudden we started to see roofs and manufacturers realized it didn't make a lot of sense for us to make raised roofs to accommodate those hats. Let's just lower the roofs and encouragement to take the hats off. Now, of course, a lot of guys that were in flat caps or newsboys that could get away with wearing their hat in the car. But for most guys especially if you're a little bit bigger, a little bit taller, you're going to have to take off that Homburg, that Trilby, or that Fedora when you get into your car. And as Americans and the world started to spend a lot more time in their vehicles, they realized the function of the hat protecting from the elements all of a sudden became unnecessary. By early 1950s, every respectable American family wanted to own at least one automobile. And as if this became their primary mode of transportation, they spent a lot more time in it not wearing their hat. Another interesting point about the rise of the automobile is that became a bigger class signifier than the wearing of a hat. Now, hats buying of themselves were never a true indicator of status. It also went with your clothing and the way you presented yourself. Within the last hundred years is we have moved towards a more casual society. We've seen that people using class and status indicators through clothing has actually dropped off although interesting, it still has a big effect on people. Hence, I always encourage you guys to dress in a manner that you're sending the message you want to without saying a word by wearing the appropriate clothing. Now, this point improved comfort technology gets overlooked a lot, but it really was the death toll of the hat. Now, depending on what study you read, you lose like 10 to 25 percent of the heat from your body through your head. In any case, I know when I'm walking outside, if I don't have a hat on, I just feel a lot colder. And that was the thing, wearing a hat was practical especially when most men were walking around or you're traveling maybe in a train that's unheated working in an office that is relatively cool. But with the advent of better heating systems not only in public transportation and in offices, but also in private automobiles, about a time a man spent actually in the elements exposed to extreme cold fell dramatically and all of a sudden the practicality of wearing headwear day to day disappeared. All right, gents. So, at this point, you're probably thinking, okay, that makes a lot of sense with hats, but what happened to the cape? I mean, come on, that was an amazing accessory. Guys, I got it covered. Why did men stop wearing capes? Seriously, we actually had capes in the United States Marine Corps which was frigging awesome, but why day to day did men stop wearing them? Guys, I got you covered with that video right here. Seriously, it's a fun video. Go check it out. Boom, right there."

A shoe like this and easy go-to, a dumb reach for when you're just running errands on the weekend, but you still want to look good. So, what shoe am I talking about? I'm talking about a pair of sneakers in a clean, versatile brown leather. Now, throughout your 20s, you had a pair of go-to whites. But, as life got busy and you got tired of cleaning them, you decided to go with a color that was a bit more forgiving. That being said, you wanted a shoe that was comfortable, something that you could literally run around in and not feel like it's weighing you down and that you can depend on for solid traction. Whether you're 23, 33, 43, or even 63, the fact is, gents, it doesn't matter what your age is. There are tons of styles out there and if you know what to look for, you can find a style that suits you that makes you look great. So, how to find the right style shoe for your age? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video. Now, this next style of footwear you didn't see coming is the classic riding boot known as the Jota boot. And the man I see wearing this, he's 26 years old and he is stepping out on his own and ready to take on the world. And, why not do that with a classic riding boot that screams for attention? Now, as you can see here, I've put some miles on my Jota boot boots. And for the most part, I love them. But, because of this buckle here, they don't slip on and off and they're not as easy to travel with as, let's say, a pair of Chelsea's. That being said, for our 27-year-old, he appreciates this style. He doesn't really care that it takes an extra couple seconds to take them off at the end of the day. No, what he's loving is they help his 5'9 frame stand like he's closer to 6 feet. And there's just something about the look, the confidence these boots give whenever he wears them. Now, earlier in this video, you might have inferred that I don't think guys over the age of 30 should wear white sneakers. That is not true. I'm just saying white sneakers take a little bit more maintenance. If the right pair with the right style can look good on any man at any age, a 63-year-old wearing these sneakers right here, I think can look great. In fact, notice the design details we've got the extra venting right there on the toes. And on the inside, we got a supple leather lining keeps you comfortable and absorbs the sweat. Now, what about the traditional dress shoes? A lot of younger guys think that they can't pull this off. Guys, classic styles like this have no age restrictions. In fact, technically no shoe does. My point being though any man age 52, age 22 can pull these off in the right situation. A pair of shoes like this with a classic closed lacing system like you see here, well, this shoe is meant to be dressed up worn with a suit or it may be dressed down with a pair of khakis or a button-down shirt. Now, does black and shiny always mean formal? No, take a look at these boots right here. Clearly, these are going to be casual. And just in case it wasn't clear, these are the details that make this shoe casual. So, first up, the rugged traction, the thickness, the heaviness of the soles. Next up, notice how the quarter is laying over the vamp. This right here with the back of the shoe, the quarter is on top of the front of the shoe. The vamp is a classic open lacing system. And last but not least, it's a boot. In general, boots are going to be more casual than dress shoes. And by the way, the guy I imagine wearing this, he's 31, he's an engineer, he's living in Chicago. These are the boots that he wears to work, he can wear it through the job site, but he also shines him up and wears him on the weekends. Now, gents, all the shoes, all the boots that you're seeing in today's video can be found over at Thursday Boots. As you can tell, Thursday Boots is a lot more than just boots. In fact, I think people are really surprised when they get over the Thursday boots and they realize, man, these guys have one of the best shoe collections you're going to find anywhere. Now, the shoes I am really loving because of their functionality, their clean, sleek design and the beautiful leathers, that is their new court series. If you couldn't tell earlier when I started the video, I absolutely love their dark brown leathers. They've got quite a few options over there. You know what the lighter browns, I always recommend when you're choosing a color, look at what you have historically worn. I know I gravitate towards brown shoes. So, just change up the style. Bring in a pair like this. You are going to love them. You're going to find a way to easily rotate these into your wardrobe. But, of course, what Thursday is known for are their boots, in particular, their laced boots. Check out their captain and their president collection. These are the styles that started it all and I think still today, these are their best sellers and for good reason. A pair of boots like this are so easy to mix and match with everything in your wardrobe. And, last but not least, let's talk about that fair price. Thursday Boots is always about making sure you get the best deal. Gents, prices have been going up on everything, but Thursday Boots has done a great job of keeping their prices affordable. And, seriously, a great deal for the quality you get. So, gents, if you're ready to step up your footwear, if you're ready to build your style foundation, your wardrobe when it comes to shoes, gents, get over to Thursday Boots and use the link in the description of today's video to make sure you get the best deal on the web. Next up, let's talk about loafers. If you are 51 or 41, you can pull these off. But, the age I think that loafers look really good on, a young man. You're 22, you're 24, you were out there just starting your career and you want to be able to step up your business casual, guys, look to a pair of classic penny loafers. Also known as Ouijaans, this style has been around for over a hundred years. And, funny enough, it was made popular in the United States starting in 1930s, 1940s by young men just like you. But, at some point, those young men grew up and that style aged with them. But, here's the deal, they look good with tons of outfits. And, a nice pair of penny loafers are versatile, are timeless. And, if you're in your 20s, they're going to have you standing out from the crowd. Then, what loafer do I recommend for a 38 or 52 year old? Well, gents, look no further than the double monk strap. And, yes, I know that this was in fashion a decade ago. I'd like to think I had a little bit of an impact. I remember when these first came out, the double monk is interesting because the single monk strap has been around for centuries, but the double monk when it appeared what I loved about it, it was a little bit less flashy. The straps are usually a little bit smaller. And, because the tension on the foot was distributed, I prefer these over the single strap because I think they're more comfortable. And, that's why I'm going to recommend them to a guy in his 50s or even 60s because these are comfortable, they're loafers, you can dress them up. And, if you choose to go with a color other than black, you can even wear these with jeans. But, yeah, don't sleep on the double monk. Now, this next boot is a style I don't talk about a whole lot. I do think it gets overlooked by the chaka, which by the way, I will talk about a little bit later in this video. But, no, I want to give the ankle boot its due because this boot right here, if you're 38 maybe 42, this is that boot that helps you make the transition to boots. You've been a dress shoe guy, you've just been a sneaker guy. The thing, you didn't even like high tops. You're just not about or don't think you need that ankle support. You're like, okay, what's the big thing about boots? These seem to be a halfway point and I would highly recommend if you've never tried on a pair of ankle boots to give them a shot, especially if for some reason you don't like the feel of a higher shafted boot. When you go with a five-eyelid boot, what's really nice about this, it feels just like a pair of shoes. Yet, the style, the look, even the modest heel give you all the benefits of a good pair of boots. I also like ankle boots because depending on the material, depending on the shine, because of their more delicate features, you could actually wear these with a casual suit. Although, I think they're most of home with more casual clothing like maybe gray flannel trousers or denim. Now, what about Chuckas, aka the Desert Boot? I feel that this is a style especially in a suede like this for a man in his early 30s, maybe late 20s. I mean, of course any age can wear anything, but for me, this is going to be a younger man's type of style. And maybe part of it's the really simple lacing system. It does make these boots ultra casual. But that in a way is why so many guys love them, why so many guys are endeared to this particular style. Now, speaking of shoes, let's talk about these full Brogue wing tips. 36, 46, 56, definitely at that age you can pull this off to I think your 26-year-old could pull this off. You need to have a little bit of gravitas behind you. Shoes like this command attention. They're going to get compliments. Without saying you've got style, you are going to say you have style when you're wearing these. Now, if you know the history on Brogue, you know that these came out of supposedly the Scottish Martians I believe. The idea was that wearing shoes with holes in them would allow the water to see about after you're making your way through a bog or a really wet area. Nowadays, this decorative carving in the leather, the Brogueing comes in a variety of different styles. But what you see here or what is known is a full Brogue wing tip. Now, if you like that look, but you want to take it to a whole other level, check out these dress boots in full wing tip. Now, as mentioned earlier, all things being equal boots are going to be more casual than a pair of dress shoes. However, because of the extra support around the ankle and the overall build we normally see in boots, I do think that they're more comfortable. And a pair of boots like this, yeah, you can wear with odd trousers, you can wear with dark denim. Heck, I'd even wear these with a casual suit. Now, do I think a 21-year-old could wear these? Yeah, but I feel like they're going to be much more at home on a man that has a little bit more history, maybe has a little bit more of the confidence of life behind them. Yeah, I'm thinking for a 41 or 51-year-old. Now, what about Moccasin style loafers? So, for that matter, Moccasin style boots. Well, both of these for me signal youth, although this one I feel is a bit younger, what, 27? I mean, if you're 17, you could pull these off. But, yeah, I'm going to go with 27. Right over here on the boots on the other hand, I'm thinking 37, 47. It really depends on your gait and how you move. I know a lot of working men that choose to go with a Moccasin style work boot because it has a larger more open style toe box and is therefore more comfortable when they're standing on their feet. But, getting back to the Moccasin loafers, for me, this is for a guy in his late 20s. I mean, if you disagree, let me know in the comments down below. I know you're 47, you're 57, you can definitely probably pull this off especially if you've got a boat. That's why these are also known in many circles as boat shoes. And, yeah, the Moccasin style boot definitely ultra casual. I feel it still gives a younger vibe, but, yeah, you could be 37, 47 and still pull this off. Now, I teach you the beginning of this video with pair of ropers. And, yes, Thursday boots carries all types of Western boots. But, getting back to the roper, I think any man at any age can pull off a pair of ropers if you are 14, if you are 84. Ropers are casual, they're comfortable. They are the go-to work boot for so many guys out there and I can see why because, yeah, they're incredibly versatile. I mean, heck, get me a pair of these in crocodile or ostrich. You could probably even wear these with a suit. And, gents, if you enjoyed this video but you want more, you like the Internet, get deeper into boots especially the right boots for your age. Guys, I've got an entire video that breaks it out right here finding the right boot for your age. I go into a lot more detail when it comes to boots. So, if you enjoyed this video, go check out this one. Boom, right here. Oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " One day, you look in the mirror and you start to notice you're losing your hair. It's starting to go thin, so you jump on Google, you type in hairstyles that work for hairstyles. And you know what keeps popping up? Shave your head. Be brave, go bald, shave it all off. But, here's the thing, you like your hair, you don't want to shave it, you want to find a hairstyle that works with what you got. In today's video, gents, we're talking about hairstyles that work with thinning hair. If you're losing your hair, if you're going bald and you don't want to shave your head, guys, this is the video for you. The textured Caesar. Now, for this particular hairstyle, the hair is cut clipper short on the sides and back and left finger length on top. Now, because this hairstyle is forward and it's got a disheveled look to it, it creates a bit more texture in the front. This is great if you're starting to have a receding hairline. Now, for this particular hairstyle, I do recommend you look at different products out there, but avoid things like gel. Oftentimes, they're going to clump your hair together and it's just not going to give you a good look. It's actually going to make some of the bald spots appear even more prominently. Instead, you want to go for things that are going to add texture. I really like matte mugs, basically non-shine. That right there is just going to add a bit of texture, give you a little bit more control. Maybe even look at a styling cream. Styling creams, again, they're just going to add a little bit more texture and they're going to have a little bit of direction they can give your hair. Even certain pomades, again, you want to make sure you find a pomade that basically doesn't clump the hair together, but there are many out there and they can give you a little bit of shine if you want something that's a little bit of a dressier look. One example of this haircut, look to George Clooney. The guy has pulled this off again and again and what I really like is you can tell he's growing his hair is starting to thin, but at the same time, he's really doing the best with what he's got. And, overall, this hairstyle, I think it looks great on him. The Sweep Back Pompadour. So, if you're starting to lose your hair right up front, this may not be the hairstyle for you. But, if you're losing your hair back here on the crown, this is the style you're looking for. Basically, with this hairstyle, you're sweeping back the hair over your head with height and volume at the front. On the side, you're keeping it shorter. You can go for finger length or you can actually cut it short with clippers and go for a more tapered look. The nice thing about the tapered side look is it makes the hair on top look a lot more prominent. Now, this hairstyle takes a bit of planning. You got to make sure you get the right cut. If you're starting off with shorter hair, you're going to need to let that hair on top grow out for a while, probably a couple months. But once you get it, you're going to find that this is a solid look. Now, the great thing with this hairstyle is there's a wide range of products that are going to work. So, matte mugs, going with a pomade, going with the styling cream, even gels that clump your hair together a bit are going to be perfectly fine. The Crew Cut Now, Crew Cut is also known as a short back and sides. Basically, the hair is left a little bit longer on top and then tapered in the back and on the sides with what's called a fade. Now, the best thing about this style if you're losing your hair is it de-emphasizes thinning hair. It does this by reducing the level of contrast between the temples and the side of the head. Now, with all the hairstyles I'm talking about, I do recommend that you work with a professional, especially if we're going for something that's going to blend in that's really going to work with your bald spots whether in the back or the front. A professional whether working at a salon or a barber is going to be able to blend in, be able to adjust things so that they look best and be able to get the results you're looking for. The Spikey Texture Cut I get it. This style isn't for everybody, but if you want a style that's going to help give a lot more texture to the top of your head and it's going to help cover up bald spots, you want to look at this style. So, in general with this hairstyle, we're going to see a mid-fade. We're going to see short hair at the back and it's going to get longer up on the top. Again, because we're going for texture, volume, and hold, you want to be using a product in the top part of your hair. So, really depending on what you're looking for if you want a bit of a shine, then you're going to go for a gel, you're going to go for a pomade. If you want something that's completely matte, then look for like a matte mud, look for a fiber. Those are going to do a good job giving you a bit of texture without the shine. Now, if you're looking to level up your style, you really need to check out my free community over on school. I've set this community up, so we've got free classes that you can make your way through step by step and learn the basic foundations of men's style. And I have to say the men that are in this group are friggin awesome. We've got to know a whole policy, people treat each other with respect. And what we've managed to create in this community is a place where a man can come in and ask questions and get some solid advice. So, gents, use the link in the description of today's video. Go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. The buzz cut. Now, this is not the same as shaving your head bald. It's close, yes, but there is a distinct and a big difference. With the buzz cut, you still feel like your hair is still there. Even if you've just got a quarter of an inch, for some reason it gives a lot of guys that bit more confidence. They're like, you know what? I've not gone completely bald, but I'm going with a short style all around my head that just simply compliments me. And the best part about this because your hair is short all the way around, it does a great job of masking your receding hairline. Another benefit, it's really easy to take care of. You can now do all your haircuts from home. And notice on this list, I did not have the comb over, yes, please avoid that that is just a bad look. But if you've lost most of the hair right here on the front and in the back, but you still got it on the sides, then consider going with a shaved top. Just shorten it on the sides with that buzz cut and guess what? Yeah, shave it right there on the top. That's actually a great refined look. Make it so."

        "transcript": " As a smart, intelligent guy, when you look at an outfit like this, you see five main parts, right? You've got the shoes, the pants, the shirt, the jacket, and a fun accessory like a watch. Well, if you're trying to build this look with a budget of 1,500 or 250 bucks, well, it makes sense that you would take that budget and divide it equally between the items. Actually, no, that doesn't make any sense because as anyone who's been out shopping knows you can find jeans for 50 bucks, you'll see pants out there for 500, shirts sometimes 20 other times 200. And don't even get me started on watches, $20 to easily 20,000. Now, for such a variance in prices for what seems like to probably most people to be a very small difference, how much should a person spend on particular items or even an outfit? Or a better question? What are the style principles? What are the rules to spending and saving when you're looking to build your professional wardrobe, when you're looking to put together outfits? Now, before I lay out the principles, when building your wardrobe where to save and where to spend, I first want to talk about what is truly the importance of your image. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does your presentation matter to your performance? The reality is some of you guys have jobs in which you really don't interact with anyone. You are dressing for yourself, you're working from home. So, in that case, you're dressing for yourself, which believe it or not, if you want to perform, well, it doesn't mean you can slack off. Yeah, seriously, there's a whole field of science called enclosed cognition. It talks about how we dress affects how we perform and how we perceive ourselves. So, yeah, even if you're working from home, shower, get dressed, maybe wear a nice sweater with your favorite fragrance and approach your day in an organized orderly fashion, even if you're not going anywhere. But, for those of you guys out there that are customer facing, you work in the service industry. You work in the banking industry, you work in sales, you engage with people on a daily basis. For people in these positions where your clothing is your uniform, spending a bit more to feel confident and to look good, I think actually I know is justified. So, assuming that you work in sales, you've returned to the office, you work around people. The first principle when it comes to where to spend and where to save is the cost per wear principle, aka the style theory of value. So, years ago, I created this overly complex formula to make myself look smart. But, the point I wanted to get across is whenever you're buying an item, you are going to use the heck out of an item you're going to wear again and again for years. For an item like this, focus in on the value, not the price. By approaching it this way, spending more to get an item that is going to serve you for a longer period of time. And every time you wear it, it looks good, it makes you feel good is a much better value than going cheap, not getting what you want and never wanting to wear the item at all. Now, on the flip side, does that mean you should only buy $1,000 watches and $500 pairs of shoes? No, the cost per wear principle really applies to when you know what you want. But, in the case when you're trying something new, let's say you got to go back to the office, yeah, you're working over there, JPMorgan, Amazon, I know all you guys have to go back to the office now. But, you swore three years ago, you were never going to wear a dress shoe again, but you got to go back in. So, what are you going to do? Well, maybe you're going to try one of those fancy sneakers. Yes, the bottom is 100% sneaker, the top is dress shoe or at least looks like a dress shoe. Point being is you got some new options, but you don't know if you're going to like it. In this case, I recommend trying something that's affordable. Well, gents, if you're looking for affordable shoes that you can grab on Amazon for, well, under $100, check out Bruno Mark. Gents, I've talked about Bruno Mark before, I tested out their shoes and what I love about them is that they are an affordable option for those of you guys on a tight budget. And even if you've got a bit more to spend, why over spend? Especially when you can try out a particular style, you can see how this look works for you. And, yeah, I love a good year well, but not every shoe has to be handmade, has to be made from the finest material. Sometimes you just need a shoe that's going to get the job done and is incredibly affordable. So, gents, go over and check out all the different styles, all the different selections over at Bruno Mark. And besides shoes, they got wide selection of boots, all different types of styles. But, yeah, I'm recommending these fun sneaker slash dress shoes, hybrid, whatever it is. Seriously, I've seen so many companies come out with variations of these and I just love the fact that Bruno Mark makes it affordable for you to be able to try this, see if it works in your wardrobe, wear it to work a few times. And, yeah, who knows? Maybe it's going to be your new look. In any case, gents, use that link in the description of today's video. Check them out, use that link. It's the best deal on the web. Where to spend? Where to save the next principle you need to know? Timelessness. Now, when you're out there shopping, you probably notice that some of the more fashionable newer items are more expensive. But, what you don't see is the hidden price that if they're fashionable, they're probably going to be out of style here soon. So, they're even more expensive because you have a limited amount of time that you can actually wear them. Now, compare that to timeless items. And when I say timeless items, these are things that have been in men's wardrobes for at least 20 years, which may sound a bit data, but thankfully men's style moves actually relatively slow. And there are so many timeless items that actually look really good. Just go back and look at some of the classically dressed men of 2010, 2019, 1990, 1980. You notice how these guys could probably walk out of that picture out of their time period and they would still look good today? That's because they're wearing timeless items. Now, a classic outfit here is a dark well-fitted suit, but on the casual side, dark denim, laced boots, white sneakers, a black or white t-shirt in crew neck or v-neck, a dark colored long-sleeved Henley or classic white button down. Now, I'm not saying you have to spend more money on items like this, but if you find something you like, it fits, it looks good on you. I do think a man stands justified whenever he spends a little bit more grabbing that item to strengthen his wardrobe. Now, right, with that, we've got the versatility principle. When you're making a determination of where to spend, where to save, the versatility of an item I think should play into this big time. That means is it going to mix and match with other items in your wardrobe? When you're looking to spend good money on a piece of clothing and it doesn't match anything you own, that's a problem because you're going to need to go out there and spend more to find items that will work with it. The opposite is true when you're looking at an item that's already going to go with everything in your wardrobe. It's going to be a force multiplier. In that case, that shirt or that jacket, if you're going to pay a little bit extra, it's probably justified especially if you don't have a whole lot of jackets. Yeah, you're looking at this jean jacket, fatigue jacket, you really like it, it fits you well, it's full price. It's not on sale. Well, if you know you're going to wear the heck out of it, we're entering fall, we're entering winter, it's a timeless item, so it's not going to go out of style. Notice how we've already checked off two principles? Boom. All of a sudden, this is an item that easily you can justify spending a little bit more for to add it to your wardrobe. Next up, let's talk about build quality that you can see, build quality that you can feel. So, the build quality that you can see is often going to be, let's say, the drape of the fabric. When you're looking at suits, the difference between an expensive suit and a cheap suit is often the material, the fabric that they've chosen to make the garment from. You see, there are cheap fabrics out there made from synthetic materials that cost maybe a couple dollars a yard. It takes on average two and a half yards to make a suit. As you can see, they're only spending a couple dollars right there on the material that are going into a suit that they're trying to sell you for a hundred bucks, which for a guy starting to offer if you're looking for a costume suit is fine. But, if you want something to be able to wear into an interview or maybe you're entering the consulting and banking industry, you don't want to be embarrassed, in that case, you want to go with the garment that you know they're using a luxury material like worsted wool. Now, of course, wools come in a wide variety of quality and price options. You've got some that are twenty-five dollars a yard, other ones two hundred and fifty plus a yard. But, the point here when it comes to quality, when it comes to the drape, when it comes to the touch, whether it's a jumper, whether it's a sweater, whether it's a pair of shoes and it's the suppleness of the leather on the upper, you can expect when you start looking for higher quality, the price is going to go up because the materials, the craftsmanship, everything that goes into the build cost the manufacturer more. Now, I mentioned something about comfort quality, the comfort build. This is when you're paying your premium for a better fit. Items that fit you better oftentimes are made for less people. If you can imagine off the rack manufacturers, they make a shirt and it's designed to fit a hundred different bodies. I mean, seriously, no two guys are like and they're trying to sell to as many people as possible. The trade off there is you get shirts, you get jackets with larger armholes which actually give you less freedom of movement. So, when it comes to clothing and you want something that really fits you perfectly, you are going to pay sometimes a bit more, sometimes a lot more, especially if you go for the ultimate which is custom. Now, there's a lot of ways to arbitrage the system. A lot of people now are ordering custom shirts directly from manufacturers maybe over in Bangkok, Thailand, but still it's going to be very difficult to get something custom at the same price that you can get something off the rack when it's on sale unless you live right next to a factory or you've got a good friend that's a tailor. Now, this next one is huge especially to understand why some people spend so much money on items that to the vast majority of the world seem like they have no value. So, when it comes to spending, when it comes to saving, let's talk about the love it principle. So, there are guys out there that you could offer thousands of dollars to wear a suit and they would say no. There are other men out there that have no problem spending thousands of dollars per suit and wearing them all the time. Watches are another great example. A lot of guys don't wear them, they think they're redundant. Other people think, hey, this ten or twenty dollar watch is my favorite, this hundred and fifty, two hundred dollar watch, I love it. People go out there and they spend thousands, you guys know this, tens of thousands of dollars on watches. I mean, what's up with this? These guys from the outside look very similar. They've got the same type of job. They maybe make the same amount of money, yet one of these guys when it comes to clothing is spending five to ten to maybe even twenty times more than the other. Well, the answer on this one isn't so much logic as it is with what people are fascinated by and what they're interested in. I mean, seriously, the guy that's not spending his money on suits or watches is spending his money on something. It could be video games, cars, trips, people who've got their things, people got their interests. And for some people, a lot of guys probably that follow my channel, they just find a fascination with the mechanics of watches. They start getting into niche fragrances and the way they're concocted and the complexities of the notes and the way they break out. Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with this as long as you stay within a healthy budget and don't go into debt. But, yeah, you're going to find some people will spend a lot more on something that many people consider frivolous, but to them is important to them has meaning. Now, this next one, very practical. That is the hard use principle. For most guys, the easy example here are their daily use shoes. The shoes that you're going to put the miles on, the shoes that you are going to put through a beading. But, an item in this category that oftentimes get neglected is your outerwear. This is the jacket that serves you every fall and spring during the rainy season that, yeah, I think you could spend a little bit more money on and be looking good, be feeling good. Maybe instead of going with that cheap rain jacket, pick up a waxed canvas jacket. Yeah, it requires a little bit more maintenance, but it has a really rugged just masculine feel to it. Leather jackets fit this category as well. I do see a lot of guys actually lean into their leather jackets and wear the heck out of them, but one problem here is I think a lot of guys actually keep that jacket too long and it would behoove them maybe to go out there and find a new one or at least to recondition the one that they keep wearing that looks like it's pretty beat up. But, yeah, any item in your wardrobe that you wear through that it seems like you're wearing out, that is a good item to spend more money on in the next time you buy, buy an investment piece that is going to last, it's going to be able to take a beating. Now, gents, if you want more, if you want the specifics to rebuilding your wardrobe, I've got you covered in this video right here. So, continue the viewing experience, you've got the principles down. I know you want some specifics, we've got you covered in this video. Boom, right here. So, dive into it. Good one."

        "transcript": " So, what exactly is a winter fragrance? I mean, are we implying that there are fragrances that smell better in cold weather? Well, according to my research here, a winter fragrance is typically characterized by warm, rich, and heavier notes. Now, it's of the opinion of the frag community that those notes project better in cold weather. And research does show that those notes when smelt especially by women and even other men that they create a feeling of being more comfortable around other people. Yeah, overall, good feelings. So, let's start with those spicy notes, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, nutmeg. I've got spice bomb extreme here which I highly recommend beautiful fragrance. Great longevity, projection, this can easily be a signature scent. But, I'm going to stop you right there because instead this winter, I am going to recommend that you check out one of the flankers. And the flanker I'm talking about is not the newest one, but one of the best. And that is the spice bomb infrared oto parfum. And just look at those notes right there at the top we got cinnamon, chili pepper, pink pepper in the middle, chili pepper and leather. And at the base, we've got resins and wood notes. What that translates into is a warm spicy fragrance that's very unique, fits in really well with the holidays. If you want something that's got a Christmassy scent but not over the top, this one is it. The cinnamon, the woods, and the amber, you can pick up everything yet. It's got that spiciness. This right here is going to tickle your nose. And it's a great pick for cold weather. Now, if you can't find infrared EDP or it's a little bit outside your budget, a less expensive alternative is Burberry London. This fragrance has been out for almost two decades and in my opinion is Christmas in a bottle. It's a crowd-pleasing scent that has the cinnamon as you notice right there at the top along with lavender and bergamot. And in the middle brings in an interesting mix of leather and mimosa. At the base, we've got tobacco leaf, guayak wood, opanax, and oak moss. Sophisticated, suitable for formal occasions, it's a very versatile fragrance with a unique cherry tobacco note that really sets it apart. Now, you may have noted those last couple of fragrances had leather. Yes, that is another great winter type of fragrance that we're going to see out there. And if you're interested in trying a leather fragrance, if you've ever wanted to try one, I highly recommend you check out Tom Ford's Ombre Leather Parfum. Of course, there's the original EDP, but I feel that's a little bit too harsh for most guys. The Parfum on the other hand, I feel is a bit better balanced and it'd be quite frank just easier to wear. And when you look at the top notes of this fragrance, you're going to see violet leaf and cedar, which no surprise to those of you guys that know notes, violet gives a very strong smell of leather and can even enhance leather notes. In the middle, we've got jasmine sandback and at the base leather woods and tobacco. Now, speaking of tobacco, it would be a natural recommendation to this point to recommend tobacco vanilla, which is a great fragrance used to keep it probably in my top 10. Now, it's kind of dropped into the top 25. And the reason being is I have another fragrance that has replaced tobacco vanilla for me. They're similar, but this one is just more refined. It's easier to wear. It's not as in your face. I just find it more beautiful. And that is MESS BOOSES tobacco flirting with vanilla. And the more I wear this fragrance, the more I realize why I like it. You're about to reveal it here in the notes. Look at that top note right there. You've got a cherry mixed in with a bergamot in the middle lily and cinnamon and at the base you've got the tobacco vanilla. And yeah, as you can imagine, it's that sweetness. The cherry with a little bit of vanilla mixed in there with tobacco. It's really sweet, but still the tobacco is not overpowered. I still get, yeah, it reminds me of tobacco vanilla again, but this is something I don't feel like I'm going to get kicked out of a car wearing. And so, I have to give a shout out to the founder of Miss BOOSES in her really creative packaging and the way she put this whole thing together. Which, by the way, gents, if you are looking for winter fragrances that nobody else is wearing like Red Colorado by M. Mikaleth or Bosqueer by the Spirit of Dubai. Well, gents, if you're looking for niche fragrances like this, you need to get over to today's sponsor Max Aroma. Not only is Max Aroma going to carry all the fragrances by Miss BOOSES, but if you're not ready to buy a full bottle, you can get a premium sample from Max Aroma so you can test before you try. In addition, Max Aroma is one of the only places where you can find some of these fragrances like Red Colorado was one of my absolute favorites from the M. Mikaleth line. And look at the notes here. As you can imagine, this is a fresh earthy type of fragrance that literally as I smell this thing, I feel like I'm back at the Red Rocks Theater enjoying an open air concert. Just smelling that fresh open Colorado air with the pines and a bit of sandalwood with that touch at the base of just a little bit of vanilla and leather not overdone. And going to check out this bottle right here by the Spirit of Dubai, we've got Bosqueer. The overall feeling of this fragrance when you smell it, this is opulence in a bottle. We're talking woods, amber, aromatic, warm spice, florals, fresh spicy citrus. I mean, look at the note breakout. I sometimes think the perfumers over at these Middle Eastern houses are trying to see how many different notes they can fit into a single fragrance, which in this case, it turned out frigging amazing. And look at the packaging here. I mean, from the outside of the box, the cover of the box, to the travel case that this fragrance comes with. So, gents, if you want to wear something nobody else is wearing, if you want to take your fragrance collection to the next level, get over to Max Aroma. They've got fragrances you won't find anywhere else at some of the best prices on the web. And, of course, gents, I take care of you. Use that link in the description of today's video to get the best deal on the web when you go over to Max Aroma. Again, use that link. It's an affiliate link, so I'd appreciate when you use it. But, yeah, guys, go over there, take advantage of this deal, go check out Max Aroma, awesome company. Now, up to this point, all the fragrances I've talked about have fit the description of winter fragrances. But, I know some of you guys are saying, well, Antonio, I want to wear something fresher. I want to wear something light. I don't want to wear a heavy winter fragrance all the time. The answer is you got options and don't feel you have to. You can wear whatever you want. And if that's you, I think a great option that's easy to find is going to be the new K Intense by Dolce & Gabbana. Now, most people when they smell this fragrance, they're going to notice at the top it's got a nice citrus to it. So, this is a summer fragrance, right? Well, the quick answer is yes, but it's also a fall winter spring fragrance. This is a four season fragrance. Notice at the base, what do we have? Leather and woods. Now, it's not the traditional vanilla that we see in a lot of winter fragrances, but it's still sweet enough and this is versatile enough that I think you could wear this fragrance at any point and easy at endier rotation if you want something fresher during the winter months. Now, another fragrance I would put in that category that's even a little bit fresher than that is going to be Yves Saint Laurent's Why and this is the Le Parfum. Now, the notes on this one are a little bit brighter with the apple aldehydes, grapefruit and ginger right at the top. And notice in the middle, we've got the lavender, we've got the geranium, we got the sage, but it's really at its base that this is a four season fragrance and that's where we see the Tonka Bean Cedar, obanum and patchouli. This fragrance often gets overlooked especially with the new myself that's out there and it is a bit overpriced, but I still think it's a great four season fragrance, especially if you're looking for something a little bit fresher, cleaner, something that is just going to be a no-brainer wear during the winter, but you don't want to wear anything heavy or oppressive. Which, by the way, this fragrance is Savage's Dior Elixir. Now, it's hard to believe Savage Elixir came out almost three years ago. When it did, it set off the whole elixir craze in the fragrance world. And I have to thank this fragrance because when it came out, it just changed everything. I mean, I don't think Dior took a big chance with this. We all knew we wanted stronger, more powerful in-your-face fragrances and, yeah, they ran with it. Yeah, this is easily a winter, cold weather fragrance. And despite there being tons of other options out there, what really makes this one unique for me is the licorice note, which not everyone's going to love, but, yeah, it's got so many other great things, the nutmeg, the cinnamon, the patchouli, grapefruit, vettelverse, sandalwood, yeah. Just an absolute masterpiece. If you haven't tried this one, this one easily could become your winter staple. I know a lot of other guys are wearing it, but trust me, it's a masterpiece. Consider picking it up. Which speaking of masterpieces, if Savage Elixir is just too, you know, too mainstream for you, check out Tony Iommi. This is with Sergeov and this is his monkey special. There's a special blend out there. This is, I think, the regular blend, but, man, this fragrance right here, this is like the 70s in a bottle with the patchouli. Yeah, it's very different than I know Elixir, but, yeah, this one another perfect winter fragrance. I absolutely love this one. And, yeah, if you're a black Sabbath heavy metal fan, how do you not own this fragrance? Now, speaking of the house of Sergeov, let's go ahead and talk quickly about 40 knots. I've thrown this fragrance out there a few times. It is an aquatic fragrance. So, how can this be a, you know, winter fragrance? Because, again, it's a deeper richer. This one, Aquidejo Profumo, if you can imagine that one being niche and being better blended and stronger, yeah, that is this one right here. That's why I've got a full large 100-mil bottle. But, yeah, absolutely beautiful fragrance. Again, it's going to be pricey. You can find it over at Maxaroma and an aquatic that you can wear during the winter. But, what if you want a less expensive aquatic to wear during the winter? One that's going to be a bit sweeter for a younger man, I've worn this. I think my wife loves it on me. Okay. So, we're talking Paco Rabon's. This is the new Invictus Parfum 2024. Just came out in the last year. Absolutely beautiful. Now, to be fair, this fragrance is not as marine or aquatic as we see a lot of the Invictus fragrances are. In fact, it's more of an aromatic musk-like fragrance, but, yeah, it gets compliments. It fits in that category. It's an Invictus and it's one of the better Invictus's that have come out in the last decade. So, I'm going to go ahead and plug it. Now, what if you want a winter woody, citrus, boozy fragrance that doesn't have much longevity? I know some of you guys are like, I don't know who's going to want this fragrance. I know some of you guys out there just like something that smells different. You like something you can wear during the winter. This one came out a few years ago. Everyone's singing to sleep on it. I think it's a great fragrance and that's going to be Yves Saint Laurent's Oum and it's the Oda Parfum. This one, again, you've got woods mixed in with like a bitter orange with a bit of booze. It doesn't last a whole long, but I mean most of the Oum fragrances don't. It's unique, beautiful. It doesn't last too long. So, just go ahead and grab a big bottle, spray a lot of it in. If you make good money, then who cares, right? And if you don't make good money, well, that's why they've got Discounters and the House of Carolina Herrera. I always find you can find some really good deals on these and both these fragrances have been out for a while. Again, these are not going to be the heavy oppressive ones. Right here on my left hand, I've got CH Men. This one has been around I know almost 20 years. It's a classic. You can find some great deals on it still. Leather Vanilla Sweet Woodsy with a bit of powdery scent. Yeah, this one is a classic. It is totally nobody wears this thing anymore yet is a great scent. And if that's not enough for you, want something that's going to get you more compliments, then just go over to the 212 VIP Black. It's got a vanilla aromatic spicy with a very unique abstinth note that for some reason just people really like this one. So, this is a compliment monster. Again, this one I've been out like 15 years. Nobody really wears it anymore. So, when you wear it, you're going to stand out and it's great for the winter because of that vanilla note. Which now I need to dive into because most of the fragrances here that are classified as winter fragrances, you're going to find vanilla is one of the dominant notes here. Seriously, the heavy headers from the house of Jean Paul Gatay, Ultraman. Did I just say Ultraman? Ultramal. We also have the Lae Parfum and the new Elixir. Actually, not knew it's been out like two years, but this one right here is still I think the go to, the Honey Note, absolutely love with the vanilla. But, if you want some a little bit gourmand, check out the scandal line. Any one of these is a good pickup. But, to keep it simple, I'm just going to say grab the original one. It's probably going to be the least expensive one out there. And that caramel note, I do think sets it apart from the pack. Now, at this point, I want to do a lightning round. These are ones that I just grabbed. I know I'm going to be wearing this winter and I do recommend you check out. So, starting things off the house I haven't talked about for a while, but I still love and has a special place in my heart that is Parfums de Marley. If you're going to start off with two fragrances, Herod actually that would have been a great one too. But, Carlisle, as you guys know, is my favorite from this house still. But, I do got to give a shout out to Leighton because I know so many of you guys love the Apple Note, you love the versatility, and again, it's got vanilla in there, so a great winter fragrance. Next up, let's talk about Stronger with You. And I realize I've actually got Stronger with You absolutely not the original. So, grab the original Stronger with You. If you didn't, I stayed away from this line for a long time. I just hated the name, but then I got the original and I'm like, wow, this stuff is really good and it's pleasantly affordable. Then I grabbed intensely. It's even better than the original. A little bit harder to find and you might as well just grab the original to spray a little bit more on. All the other flankers you're going to see out there, the Oud, the I mean, they've just got all different leather, grab the original and then go try the other ones. I find that the original is still the best. Absolutely, yes, had a little bit more of a nut note in it, but it's hard to find. So, it's not worth paying extra, just grab the original. And I know I already talked about this house, but Tom Ford, two other winters I grab all the time. This is going back, what, five years I picked these things up and absolutely still love them. So, Black Orchid, I'm not able to wear it as much as I used to because I've got so many fragrances now, but I still absolutely love it. Look at the note breakout, that Mexican chocolate with those earthy notes. This thing is just absolutely magical. The same thing with Noar Extreme. I think that this one is better than the Parfum. The Parfum, nothing wrong with it. It just feels flat. It doesn't feel as, yeah, the EVP is where it's at. So, just grab the original, you save yourself a few bucks. And, yeah, absolutely beautiful fragrance, a masterpiece right here. And, of course, for my budget conscious friends out there, check out Halloween Man X. Sweet, coffee, cozy, this fragrance is magic. And, it's incredibly cheap. So, what did I miss? What fragrance for sure? Did you think I was going to talk about, but I didn't? That you are gatekeeping? Let us know in the comments below. And, of course, gents, keep your viewing experience alive by, yeah, checking out this video right here. Come on, Killian's Angel Share easily I could have put onto this list. Gucci, Guilty, Absolute, yes. And, so, find out some of my other fragrances that absolutely love my favorite picks this last year. Boom, I got you covered right here. Come on, right there, yeah."

        "transcript": " If you ever had one of those days when you wake up late and you are rushed, you're frantic, you're all over the place, you're going through your closet trying to find a shirt, pants, jacket trying to put together an outfit that works, but you can't find anything that matches. And it's not that you don't have enough clothing, you got tons of shoes, you got neckties, but you just can't seem to piece it into a good looking outfit. So, what if there was a simple way to eliminate all this heading? A simple five-step process to always looking well-dressed. Well, gents, I guarantee the five simple rules I'm going to lay out in today's video will not only have you dress in sharp in less time, but just might transform you into the most stylish guy in your area. So, how to always be well-dressed especially when you're in a hurry. So, did you guys see that SpaceX launch the other day? Yeah, the one that had engineers crying tears of joy returned back to its own launch pad and returned landed safely. Basically, catching this booster back at the launch pad was a huge step in space travel and in ways with science fiction without the fiction part. Now, I'm bringing this up because as a smart guy, you understand the importance of launch pads. Launch pads are crucial platforms where everything is prepped, checked, and ready for a flawless launch. Without a launch pad and that thorough preparation, everything could easily fall into chaos. So, having said that, if you always want to be well-dressed without the chaos, guys, have a style launch pad. Gents, having a style launch pad serves as your daily platform for launching your well-dressed day. And as you can see, it's not overly complex. The night before, you lay out the clothing you're going to wear, paying attention to all the details, your jacket, your shirt, your fragrance options, the watch you're going to wear, pre-selecting the trousers you want to go with and making sure they're pressed, maybe giving yourself an option for a necktie and having your shoes ready, standing by, and polished. Gents, with your clothing carefully selected the day before, you're going to have a seamless takeoff even if you're running behind first thing in the morning. In fact, you're not only going to save yourself time, but also energy, yeah, decision fatigue, it's a real thing. Gents, there's no reason to start your day trying to make a decision about what you're going to wear. No, save your energy, save your brain power to focus in on what's really important. And instead, have your style platform laid out so that you can get dressed with confidence knowing that your outfit is going to propel you into the day. So, your next step to always being well-dressed especially when you're in a rush is to have a go-to outfit. So, when I say a go-to outfit, this is an outfit that you are confident wearing. Every time you put it on, you feel like a million bucks. On top of that, your go-to outfit should also fit these four criteria. All right, so let's talk about fit. We're going to break this into two parts talking about finding the styles that fit your body type and then getting the clothing adjusted to fit your body, two separate things. So, first up, body types. Body types for men come in all different shapes and sizes. What you're going to find though is that some body shapes are much harder to dress for than others. Two of the hardest shapes to dress for are going to be men that are large around the midsection and men that actually spend a lot of time in the gym and have a large drop, which basically means that their chest on average is six or more inches larger than their waist. These harder to fit body types need to be careful of clothing combinations and clothing styles that over accentuate these areas of their body and could make them look cartoonish. However, there is one garment no matter what body type you are. Tall and thin, short and stout is going to make any man look better and that is the simple classic suit. Here, as you can see, I'm trying on a suit and it doesn't matter if you've got a dad body, if you've got large shoulders, if you have skinny legs and skinny arms with a little bit of a belly. Gents, it doesn't matter. A suit is made to give a masculine silhouette to any man's build. Now, as the magic power to take a guy that's 100 pounds overweight and make him look large and in charge, give weight, give breath to a skinny guy or a stout square guy with a neck like a bulldog, give him a more regal appearance. Suits can be dressed up, they can be dressed down, you have a lot of options here. Now, really quick, gents, today's video is sponsored by Ritual. The reality is, gents, when it comes to our diet, most of us guys aren't getting the nutrients we need. If you're a guy on the go, if you're incredibly busy, you need to be looking at a multivitamin that fills in the gaps and ensures you get the nutrients and vitamins your body needs. Now, personally, I've been using Rituals Essentials for Men for over two years. I love this multivitamin because it contains 10 key nutrients that a man's body needs and all the ingredients used are traceable. Basically, Ritual is 100% transparent on where everything is made, where everything comes from. And I also appreciate how they use a lot of delayed release technology. So, not everything is dissolving in the stomach, instead it makes its way intact to the small intestine which is where the nutrient absorption happens. Now, beyond multivitamins, as a lot of you guys know, your gut health incredibly important. And, if you're looking for a probiotic, you need to check out Ritual's symbiotic plus. This is basically a prebiotic, probiotic, and postbiotic all in one because the reality is a lot of you guys are working hard, you're stressed out and taking care of your gut, alleviating digestive discomforts can be as simple as using a daily supplement like symbiotic plus. And everything over at Ritual is formulated without GMOs, without glutons or major allergens, no artificial colors, and everything is vegan friendly. Oh! And by the way, if you're not satisfied with Ritual, just let them know and that first bottle, that first order is on them. So, guys, you have nothing to lose. Check out Ritual down in the description of today's video. You're going to get 25% off. Use that link to get the best deal on the web. Go check them out. Awesome company. Now, I'm going to finish fit here in a second, but I want to talk about the next requirement for your go-to outfit. Yeah, it needs to suit your lifestyle. Now, I know so many of you guys are like, Antonio, I'm never going to wear a suit. If that is the case, there are tons of casual outfits that you can put together that leverage the power and the philosophy of the suit. You see a suit by definition is nothing more than a jacket and a pair of trousers made from the same fabric. When matched together, this gives us a monochromatic look, but you can replicate this with casual clothing as well. You can wear a lightweight casual jacket with a pair of joggers. And as long as the colors are close, you're going to get that monochromatic look which is going to allow the eyes to go up and down and streamline your overall appearance, which again is important if you're a bigger guy, if you carry a little bit of weight around the midsection. But, even if your go-to outfit is casual, you do want to make sure that everything fits your body. So, this is where as I've said many times before, you need to know the name of your tailor. Take your clothing in to get it adjusted. Whether it's a pair of jeans, a lightweight casual button down, and for sure any of your dressier clothing like a suit which, by the way, when you buy it, you should make sure to get it adjusted to fit you perfectly right out the store. You know, the other factor on your go-to outfit, it should leverage neutral colors. Whites, blacks, grays, browns, blues, these colors right here are going to make up 80% or more of your wardrobe. And that isn't a bad thing. A lot of guys think this is boring, but just by leveraging neutral colors, you make it so easy to mix and match the pieces and to be able to introduce new pieces which we'll get into in a few minutes and that's going to expand your options. Lastly, your go-to outfit needs to take into account your physical environment. If you live in Los Angeles or Dallas, the outfits, the clothing that you choose, the thickness of the fabrics is going to be different than if you're up over in New York or Toronto or Chicago. Both Houston and Seattle are near the water, but they've got very different environments. And all of this is going to play into the clothing pieces you're going to choose. Now, my general guidance here when it comes to heavier fabrics whether it be sweaters, whether it be jackets, whether it be trousers, be careful about them. They're not going to be as versatile as lighter weight fabrics. Now, lighter weight fabrics are usually going to be breathable and you may say, well, they're going to work where it gets cold or here's the thing with lighter weight fabrics, you can usually layer them easier. So, that's why I like to lean towards those type of materials. So, our next major rule here to always be well-dressed even when you're in a hurry, guys, is to clear out the clutter. You can have some awesome clothing in your closet that would make an amazing outfit, but if you can't find it, you're screwed. So, once a year at least go through your closet and create four piles. You've got your love it, you've got your like it, you've got your leave it, and you've got your lose it. Now, everything that goes in the lose it category is clearly something you need to get rid of. It doesn't fit you, it's stained, it's torn, it's beyond repair. Now, the leave it category a little bit more complex. You've got the sports jacket, it still fits you, but you haven't worn it for five years. Do you really need this thing? Could you maybe donate it or sell it? So, what you're going to do with these items, you're going to put them in a box, you're going to put a date on them one year from now. And when that date comes to pass, you know that you didn't need this item and you can either donate it or sell it, just get rid of it. So, the like it and the love it categories. For most guys out there, the majority of their clothing is going to go into the like it. A few things are going to go into the love it. Now, what you're trying to do here, the reason that we're breaking these up is you want to identify why do certain items, why do I love them so much? Because as you start to replace the items in the like it category, can you actually get it so that you replace them with items that are closer to being in the love it category? Long term, you actually build a wardrobe full of clothing that you love that every time you put these outfits together, every time you put these garments on, you feel like a million bucks. So, the next tip to always be well-dressed is to double down on the garments that you wear hard. I'm talking about the wardrobe staples that you use again and again and you've only got one of them. Yeah, that go-to white dress shirt that matches everything that looks good. Gens, if it gets a stain on the collar that can't be removed if it's torn or after coming out of the wash for some reason it starts turning yellow. No, if this is a go-to garment, you need to have a backup. Think about other things in your life, things you use a lot. You've got a backup plan, right? You've got to have the same thing for your go-to pieces of clothing. Your favorite black t-shirt that you've only got one of you wear it all the time. Guys, the amount of times you're going to wear this, the thing is going to fade over time. So, look at the brand, look at the company, go over there, join their email list, find out when they're going to have a sale, maybe a two-for-one deal, get a few more of these shirts that you absolutely love. When it comes to jeans, when it comes to denim, yes, you've got your go-to pair that you're wearing and you're getting the nice whiskers on. Well, guys, maybe have a backup pair that you're rotating through because it's the things that we love that, yeah, we're wearing at work and all of a sudden we get caught on something, it just rips a hole in there. You're sad, you're upset, but if you've got a backup piece, well, things aren't that bad, right? That go-to hoodie, that go-to sweater, maybe a casual pair of white sneakers that you absolutely love. Having duplicates, having twins here is not a bad deal. Now, a bonus point on this one, instead of getting duplicates, twins actually get a sibling. I'm talking about the style spectrum. That's when, hey, you really like the style of this boot, but maybe go with a slight variation and maybe a darker brown or a lighter brown or a suede. You notice that you like sports jackets, you got a solid green, maybe go with that same green, but go with a little bit of a check, a little bit of a pattern in it. When you're expanding your style spectrum here, you're going with a piece that's already proven, one that you already wear, maybe from a brand that you already love, and you're looking for something that's just one degree over, whether it be a slightly different style in the same color or that same style, but in a slightly different color or material. This right here is an easy way to start expanding out your wardrobe to make sure that whenever you're in a hurry, you're rushed, you have pieces of clothing that work that make it so easy to be able to dress well. So, this next rule, to always be well-dressed, builds off a point I've talked about many times here on my channel and that is having an interchangeable wardrobe. So, we talked earlier about your go-to outfit. You may have picked up everything I listed in that go-to outfit is about it being interchangeable. So, what you want to do is you've got that go-to outfit that gives you confidence that works for your job in a variety of situations. You want to start building off of that by changing out pieces and bringing in pieces that are going to go with it. The idea here is when you introduce new pieces into your wardrobe and they all work with each other, you're able to create outfits not through addition of pieces like we see across here. Four shoes, four shirts, four trousers, four jackets, four combinations, no, instead of four plus four plus four plus four, we get four times four times four times four. But, one was only able to produce four outfits, the other one, 256 outfits. Now, in order to be able to make this happen, there's a few rules I like to follow. One, for the most part, I stick with neutral colors. So, we're not going with anything outlandish, anything overly bright, no colors that are way too out there. Next up, the styles of the clothing overall work with each other. Your clothing overall is going to be less interchangeable if you're trying to mix and match dress clothing with casual clothing. It's possible you can do it with items like jeans and boots, but you usually need to be more creative. Another key to making this work is to color block each of the sections. I know for me when it comes to my footwear, I'm going to stick with browns, usually dark browns. Most of my trousers are going to be tans or grays. The vast majority of my shirts are going to be white and variations of blues and patterns leveraging those two colors. While my jackets for the most part are going to be blue with occasional greens and browns. Gents, by following these simple rules, I find it's relatively easy for me to always be well-dressed even when I'm rushed, even when I'm hurt. Now, gents, if you enjoyed today's video, you want more tips on how to look good with ease, not having to worry about it. Guys, check out this video. Boom, right here. I got you covered, how to dress well without thinking about it. Effortless style, I got you covered. Boom, right here."

        "transcript": " So, if you were to ask 10 men, when it comes to dressing stylishly, do you always know what you're doing? Well, it's safe to say that 7 out of 10 would not know how to build a wardrobe that represents their own personal style. And the three guys that think they understand style, well, they probably need more help than the guys that are unsure. Hello, my name is Antonius and 10-O. Well, gents, for over a decade, I've been helping men unlock their confidence by learning how to dress well. Here at RMRS, we've created thousands of videos and articles to help guys become the man they know themselves to be. And I've witnessed firsthand how a great looking outfit can transform not only the way that others see you, but the way that you see yourself. Together, we're going to navigate the twists and turns of men's style, uncovering the hidden secrets and timeless tricks that can transform your style from eh to wow. The reality, gents, in today's modern world, first impressions matter more than ever. And when people meet you, they see you for the first time, they judge you based off of what they see oftentimes in a matter of seconds. If I had to start building a wardrobe today knowing what I know now, what would I do? First impressions are interesting for two reasons. Number one, they're oftentimes wrong. Number two, they're very difficult to dislodge. Why do we do this? Because as human beings, we want to be right. We don't want to take a step back and admit that we're wrong even if we don't have to admit that to anyone else. This matters because first impressions, gentlemen, are incredibly powerful. So, the first six things a woman notices. Number one, your physical attributes. Next up, your clothing and accessories. After that, she's going to pick up on nonverbal communication. And right after that, she's going to pick up on how you socially interact. Now, once the conversation starts within seconds, she's going to pick up on your personality traits. And last but not least, she's also going to pick up on your interest and lifestyle choices. So, first up, gents, we've got your physical attributes. And this makes sense because whenever you're meeting somebody for the first time, they are visually going to look you up and down and they're going to make a judgment. Next up, let's talk about clothing and accessories. Now, as you guys know from my channel, I'm more of a classically styled guy. But, I get that not every guy is like this. A lot of you guys are street style. Some of you guys are going to be more rockabilly or you've got your own look. The thing is, wear the right uniform. If it's a casual event, dress casually. If it's a formal event, dress formally. If it's an event that's outside, wear the right clothing. Think about who you are, what you represent. Now, for me, if I'm going to a casual event, let's say it's a networking event, it's outdoors. I'm still going to probably wear a sports jacket. I'm still going to dress nice. Why? I'll be out dressing most people there because I represent my company. And that's the key is you want to make sure that you meet when they talk with you, when they get their card, when they learn more about you, you look the part of a success in your industry. So, now, let's talk about body language, the nonverbal communication thing. So, first up, she's going to notice the way that you are standing, the way you're presenting yourself. If you look like you are a threat, if you're coming off as really like standoffish, you know, guys, people aren't going to be as likely to approach you. Some people will maybe that know you, but if you look like you don't want to be approached, understand that people are going to take that hint and they're going to believe you and probably not approach you. Next up, let's talk about social interactions. And this one's pretty big and I think the most important one here to understand is the way other people treat you, she's going to pick up on this. So, if you walk into a club, you walk into a bar, you walk into a party and everybody knows you or at least it seems like everybody knows you and they're treating you like you are the man. She's going to assume that you are the man. Now, when you're talking with her, she's going to pay attention to a number of things. First up, your mannerisms, the way that you talk, the way that you move, the way that you treat others. Maybe you guys are at the bar, she's going to the way that you treat the bartender, the way that you talk to others. Now, let's talk about your personality traits. First up, did you have the confidence to go up and just start talking with her? Yes, she had a boyfriend and you pretty much got shot down. But you started a nice conversation and so, she formed a good impression of you. But maybe she didn't and maybe, hey, she actually recognizes that you did come up and talk to her because she's been at events where other men are intimidated. Yeah, they'll make eye contact, they'll look at her, but they won't come up and talk. So, by having the confidence just to throw your hat in the ring, guys, you are setting yourself apart. Next up, your sense of humor and women, they love a man with a sense of humor especially high humor. Humor is where you can use sarcasm where it basically shows that you can think versus low humor is going to be slapstick humor, that's going to be crude humor using jokes like that. Next up, let's talk about your interests and lifestyle. So, this is something as you know when you're meeting somebody for the first time when you got a few seconds, what are you doing? Or even before you met up with them, you're doing the research, you're looking at their social profiles, you're looking at their Instagram account, you're looking at every Facebook, whatever it may be, you are trying to find out more information, do you have friends in common, yada yada. So, if you do have a social presence, make sure that you've gone through it and maybe have, you know, your sister, maybe have somebody that you've dated in the past that's still a good friend, maybe have another guy friend, okay, look at this, how can I improve my profile? So, imagine if every piece of clothing that you put on your body looked amazing. Seriously, you walk outside and you are just getting compliments. Now, the funny thing is this happens to a lot of guys that are implementing my advice when they're wearing just their everyday normal clothing. So, what's their secret to looking good without even trying? Gents, it's no secret, it's called the style pyramid. So, the basic concept of the style pyramid is that everything you wear will meet this basic criteria. It will fit your body, it will be of the right function and it will be made from the right fabric. This may sound simple, but most guys are violating one of these three tenants and this is what happens is they end up walking out wearing something that has potential, but then fails. It makes them look not nearly as good as they can be and even worse, sometimes it makes a guy look just outright bad. That's what we want to prevent. We want to make sure that you're not just meeting the basic, but you're eventually starting to master each of these three and therefore when you walk out you look amazing just wearing normal clothing. So, let me ask you a question. Do you think a guy 30 to 40 pounds overweight purposely puts together an outfit? That makes him look more fat? Or let's take a skinny guy. Do you think he purposely puts together an outfit that makes him look like he hasn't eaten for a month? The answer is they don't know how to dress for their body type and in today's video, I'm covering five body shapes and how to dress for them. Body shape number one, the triangle. What we see with the triangle body shape is that the lower part of the body is larger in proportion to the upper part of the body. Now, with all the body shapes, the triangle body shape in my opinion is the one that benefits most from the choice of clothing. In particular, we want to build up the shoulders. So, the first specific item that I recommend for any man with a triangle body shape is a jacket. We're talking sports jacket, blazer jackets, suit jackets, anything with a shaped shoulder going to make you look stronger, going to make you look taller, make you look more square up on the upper body. When we're dressing the lower body for the triangle body shape, talking about jeans, trousers, pants, we want the lines to go up and down. What we don't want to do here is overly taper. A lot of fashions nowadays, they're trying to create this tapered bottom. You want to be careful because with the triangle body shape, what this can unfortunately do is create a diamond. That's not what we want. For the triangle body shape, the straight cut is going to be your friend. Now, really quick, I want to share with you a hack to lengthen your leg line. Okay. Do you notice the difference? Look at the guy on the left. Do you notice how his leg line looks longer because his belt matches his trousers? For the vast majority of body types out there, you're going to want to elongate your leg line because it's going to make you look taller, it's going to make you look leaner and stronger. The next body shape is the inverted triangle, the V shape. So the key with the V-shaped body is that you want to make sure you don't over exaggerate any parts of your body which are in a sense already overbuilt, in particular the shoulders and the arms. If you wear a suit jacket that has a lot of padding in and around the shoulders, you're going to end up looking like a linebacker. Why is this a bad thing? Because you're up there to give a presentation, not have people saying like, wow, this guy looks really like a cartoon character. And that's the key with this body type, not hiding your well-built body, but making sure it doesn't distract from the message you're trying to get across. So my favorite piece of menswear for the V-shaped body is going to be the sweater especially a little bit of a v-neck sweater right here. This does not hide your body, it makes you look great. It has a little bit of stretch and then around the shoulders, the chest in the arm area. People are going to be able to see this guy looks great, he's in shape. Now, let's talk about the lower body type of the V-shaped individual. You need to be careful of certain things. One when it comes to shorts, never wear shorts that are overly long. This is just simply going to make your legs look smaller and shorter, you do not want this. So, actually go maybe for a shorter inseam. We're talking five inches, we're talking seven inches. Maybe look the tropical weight wool trousers especially those are going to have a nice drape. This overall is going to make your legs look better and I think it's a more professional look. You can pull this off with a polo shirt, I think this is a much better look than going with the shorts. And let's talk about chinos, let's talk about dress pants, let's talk about jeans. You're going to be looking for a straight cut, you can lean towards the slim cut, but what you want to be careful of in a void is the skinny cut. This does not look good for this body type. Again, it makes that lower body look even smaller. Next we've got the rectangle body shape, your shoulder, your hips, your waist. They're all going to be about the same up and down. We're going to see this body type on slight or slender framed men. Now, this is not a bad body shape, one of the more common ones we're going to see out there. So, the advantage for the rectangle body shape is that the vast majority of clothing out there is actually made to fit his body. Now, the problem though for guys with this body shape is that they want to change it up a bit. They want to build up their shoulders, slim up their waist, create a more masculine look. You can do this with a jacket as I discussed any type of jacket will build up the shoulders, but also having a sweater, a jumper that has a line going across that builds up the chest area. There's another sweater that's got a shoulder patch, that right there is going to draw attention. Now, another option for this body type is to build up the V right here in the chest. You can choose that by going with a V-neck sweater, V-neck shirts. Now, as I've mentioned, shorts for any body type, they're not going to do you any favors, but if you're going to go with shorts, avoid the cargo shorts, go for something that's going to have a little bit of a closer cut. Make sure that the inseam doesn't go beyond nine inches and if you're shorter, maybe look at seven, even five inches. Again, you want something that's going to fit well. And when it comes to trousers, jeans, chinos, you want to go for a regular or a slim cut. Don't go skinny and don't go overly loose and go for a little bit of a taper. It works well for this body type. Next up, we've got the oval body shape. And for this body shape, your midsection is larger than your shoulders or your hips. Now, I'm not going to lie, gents. This is a tough body shape to dress for and there's no outfit that's going to make a guy like this look thin. But what I can't help you do with these tips is to look large and in charge versus fat and sloppy. That's what we want to avoid. We want the eyes to go up and down. We do not want to get caught anywhere in the midsection. So, if you are wearing clothing that has a high contrast between your upper body and your lower body and we're being drawn to your midsection, that's the mistake. You've got to stop shooting yourself in the foot. You've got to wear monochromatic looks. You've got to wear clothing that's going to bring it all together. So, the first piece of clothing I'm going to recommend for a larger guy and this requires confidence, a nice hat. A good piece of headwear. This right here is just going to level up your style. People are going to look at you and like, yeah, you can't hide the size of your body, but what you can send the message of is I care about how I look. In addition, hats make you look taller. The next thing I want to talk about is your footwear. You want to bring up a bit of height there. Go for a pair of boots. Go for a pair of shoes that have a bit of a heel. Something that has a bit of shine, we're going to be drawn and our attention is going to look at those shoes. You've just elongated your overall look. Now, this next detail isn't a particular clothing item, but it applies to your shirts, it applies to your jackets, it applies to your accessories. Make sure that you pay attention to proportion. If you've got a nice watch, if you're wearing a shirt, that you don't have a shirt with collars that are too small for the proportion of your body. So, you want to look in particular for shirts that have larger collars. You want to look for jackets that have wider lapels. You want to look for a watch that's going to be a bit larger. All of these particular details, they do measure up and you want to make sure the clothing proportionally looks right on your body. So, in a little bit more detail, let's talk about lines, let's talk about patterns. So, for this body shape, you want to avoid any lines going across. So, a window pane pattern on a suit, you do not want to wear it with this body type. You want to go instead for a solid looking suit. It's going to just work allow the eyes to go up and down. Now, when it comes to shirts, I do think a pinstripe, a candy stripe, or a bangle stripe even a little bit thicker of a stripe works well for this body type when it comes to shirts. And when it comes to patterns, small repeating patterns are great, medium size patterns are okay, but avoid larger size patterns. And when it comes down to particular clothing styles, formal clothing rules when it comes down to making this body type look better. Why? Well, let's look at the jacket. Again, builds up the shoulders, but also the length of the jacket. So, it's going to cover the buttocks and when we look at the transition of the body, we're looking at a guy right there that length of the jacket is going to allow the eyes to go up and down. In addition, formal trousers historically went up to the natural waist. Nowadays, they're a bit more difficult to find, but I would recommend if you're having issues with keeping your trousers up, even look to get these custom made. Use suspenders with them, they're going to \u2013 it's just a much more elegant way to wear trousers and you're not going to have to pull them up throughout the day. Now, at this point in the video for San Antonio, this is a lot of material. I wish I could just see it written out or in a simple chart. Well, guess what, gents? I got you covered down in my free group over at school. I'm linking to it down in the description. It is the RMRS community. Gents, I'm telling you straight up, this group is frigging amazing. Not only do I have free courses including one a step-by-step guide to finding your style, but we also do weekly giveaways and there are a lot of great guys in there where you can post basically your outfit of the day, whatever watch you're wearing, your scent of the day. And guess what? People give you immediate feedback. In fact, the interaction is not only, you know, really quick, but it's always positive because we've got to know a whole policy. Seriously, I wanted a place where men could show up and could become their best selves. So, again, gents, that group is absolutely free down in the description of today's video. I'm linking over to the RMRS community. The next body shape and oftentimes considered to be the ideal body shape is the trapezoid. A trapezoid body shape has well-developed shoulders and chest and it has about a six to eight inch drop down to the waist and the hip area. Now, this body type is relatively easy to dress. What you want to pay attention to here is finding the right brands that are going to have slim cuts, athletic cuts that are naturally going to fit your body. You've probably grown up buying clothing that's ill-fitted and you're not even taking it to get adjusted. So, first off, if you've got to closet clothing, you like the look of it, take it to a tailor. You will be amazed all of a sudden when they slim up the waist area whenever they make those sleeves a little bit shorter and it looks you look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, wow, I actually am able to show off this amazing body that I've got. And if you're not happy with the clothing, you're looking to rebuild your wardrobe, consider going and spending a little bit more money to buy those specialty clothing types that come with the athletic fit. So, why do some outfits work and others don't? To put it simply, gents, there are colors that work for you and there are colors that don't. So, first up, I'm going to take the billions of men on this planet and I'm going to divide them into seven skin tones. If you can't tell, that's me being a bit funny because of the foolishness of even trying to do this, but I want to give you guys a working system. And by going with these seven right here, most likely you will fit in one or be close to one of these categories, maybe you're between two and in that case, go for both the colors in both of those categories. So, starting here at the very top, we've got very fair skin. Next up, we've got fair skin. After that, light skin, then you have medium skin. Holder down olive skin, then brown skin and then finally dark or deep skin. Now, in today's video, I'm not going to talk about undertones. In case you didn't know, every single one of those skin types could be a cool undertone, a warm undertone or a neutral undertone. For today's video, to keep it simple, I am assuming a neutral undertone. So, the first seven colors I'm going to share with you. Navy blue, gray, and this comes in a variety of shades and tones here. Pure white, burgundy, what a beautiful color. A classic neutral. Charcoal, which in case you didn't know, is a very sophisticated alternative to black. And finally, teal, probably the most unique and striking color on this list. Gents, all seven of those colors work for pretty much any skin tone. These are what I would call your default wardrobe colors. If you wanted to build a classic, versatile, interchangeable wardrobe from scratch, one that you would get a lot of miles out of, that you would be able to get your money's worth out of. Maybe if you used these colors right here in 90% of your clothing choices, you would have something that would stand the test of time. I mean, assuming the styles of the clothing you're buying is classic. So many times, people try to bring in too much color. I like to look at color as spice. You just add a little bit to the meal and it brings out the flavors. Now, before I get into the colors that really work for your skin tone, I want to warn you with colors you probably want to stay away from if you've got this particular skin tone. So, if you're on the far end, if you're from Northern Ireland, if you've got a lot of colors, you've got really fair skin with light colored hair. Colors that you want to avoid are anything that are going to be neon, any dark browns and olive greens. Now, that first set of colors may seem obvious to a lot of you guys, but the last two it's like, hey, can't these work? Maybe some of you guys with really fair skin are saying, hey, I actually have an olive green sweater that I like. Well, gents, I want to stress you can wear whatever you want. What I'm trying to point out is that there are colors that are probably going to do a better job than the ones I'm warning you to avoid wearing. So, leave in very fair skin, let's go over to the fair skin guy. In that case, he's going to want to avoid bright orange, pale yellow, and very dark shades of most colors. And, by the way, when it comes to skin tones that are one degree of separation away, you would probably want to listen to this advice as well. Because the reality is very dark shades, I know a lot of situations in which a guy with light colored skin, very light colored skin would want to wear something like this. And you maybe you're going to a wedding and you got to wear that tux. Again, I'm not saying you can't wear it, I just want you to be aware that those really dark colors can wash you out. So, instead of wearing that black rental, can you talk to your buddy about you wearing your charcoal gray tux that makes you look amazing? So, what about if you've got light skin? So, the colors you're going to want to avoid are going to be gold, tan, and definitely bright red. What about for the medium skin guy? So, he's going to want to avoid the neon brights, pale pastels, and very dark browns. Now, this guy can still wear a pastel, but he wants to avoid the really pale ones. The ones that look almost white, they're going to just pull color out of his skin and they're not going to compliment him as well. Now, what about the guy with olive skin? So, this guy wants to be careful with the color green. Mustard yellow is going to do him no favors. And the caramel or walnut browns he needs to be careful with because they won't give enough contrast between the skin. Now, what if you've got brown skin? The colors you want to avoid here are going to be black, dark purple and browns, and very pale pastels. For the guy that's got dark or deep colored skin, it turns out it's very similar. He wants to be careful again with the color black, the dark browns and dark greens and again, the very light, very muted pastels. So, what's the deal with black? Why do you need to be careful with it whenever you've got darker colored skin? Well, the reality is in certain situations like black tie, I think it can look really good, but it can also be overpowering or too harsh especially in a nonformal situation or where you don't have black next to a white shirt. The same thing with those shades of purples of brown of green. They're just too dark, they work with the skin. Instead of going with shades, maybe you want to go with tints. All right. So, I didn't mean to confuse you, you may be thinking what's a shade, what's a tint, what's a hue, let me explain. So, the word hue, this is the pure form of a color. A hue has no addition of black, white or gray to it. Hues are the base colors as they appear on the color wheel. By the way, there are thousands of hues and in today's video, most of the colors I'm talking about are hues. Now, shades as the name sort of indicates, this is when you take a hue and you add a bit of black to it. And depending on the percentage of the color black you add to that hue, it will darken the color. Now, the reason this is done in clothing and also in art is it creates a deeper sense of feeling and intensity with the color. An example here is the hue of blue, but you add a bit of black, what do you get? Navy blue. Now, a tint is the opposite of a shade because this is where you're starting to add white to the hue. Again, let's take the hue of blue and let's add a bit of white. What are the colors we're going to get? Baby blue, maybe even sky blue. And while we're on the subject, let's talk about tones. Tones are where you take a hue and you add the color gray. So, why would you ever want to add gray? We've got white and black because when you add gray to a color, it reduces the colors intensity. It makes the color less subtle, it makes it less bright. In the case of the hue blue, all of a sudden, we get steel blue. All right. So, getting back to our seven skin tones, let's talk about the colors that will make these skin tones look amazing. First up, for very fair skin, these three colors the ones you want to gravitate towards. First up, we've got salmon. This is going to be a red tint. What's great about salmon is it's so flattering for very light fair skin. There's not a lot of colors that can do this, but salmon just works so well with this complexion. If you can find shirts in salmon, this is going to look so good with your complexion. Next up, we've got light blue, specifically powder blue. Now, most men are going to look good in a variation of blue, but the key right there is finding the variation. And for this very light skin tone, you want to go for this one here that's not going to overpower your complexion. Again, perfect for casual shirts, dress shirts, even a sports jacket. Next up, we've got a soft pink specifically light pink. It's gentle, it's warm, and it adds a nice flush of color. Next up, for the fair skin, man. First up, we've got Indian red. What I love about this color is it's muted, it's warm, and it works really well for this particular complexion. Next up, we've got coral pink. It's a warm pink with just a hint of orange that gives, again, a really healthy complexion to your skin. That's what we're looking to do here, find colors that make your skin glow. Next up, let's get over to the green hue. Specifically, we're going to go with the medium C green. So, this color is really unique and what I like about it is it provides just enough contrast, but of course, it's not overpowering. And, gents, again, as a reminder, I'm giving you a guide. You can say to hell with any of this, you can wear whatever you want. What I would recommend is try out some of these colors I'm recommending because I want you to find something that just you wouldn't have noticed until you put it up next to your face. A lot of women are conditioned to do this. They go out, they do that. I've got daughters. Whenever they're out grabbing a dress, they put it up right next to their face because they want to see how it makes their face glow. I want you to be able to find colors like this that just work for you that make you feel like a million bucks that help give you the confidence to go out there and change the world. Next up, we've got the light colored skin, man. The colors that are going to work for him. First up, we've got pale green. So, this is a light fresh color that works especially well in the spring and summer. Next up, we've got peach. This is a soft warm hue that complements light skin with its subtle inviting warmth. Next up, we've got a soft lavender specifically the color is thistle. This is a muted lavender that is a unique color and it works really well with light skin. What I love about this one is it's going to help you stand up from the crowd without looking like you're trying too hard. All right. So, for the guys with a medium skin tone, the first color here is yellow green. Now, this is a bright and lively shade of green that really does a great job of enhancing your skin tone. It brings out the warmth and it's a unique color that can help you stand up from the crowd. Next up, we've got one of my favorite colors, amber. This is a rich warm yellow that enhances your natural skin warmth. Next up, let's go over to the blue hue specifically medium turquoise. Now, this is a really vibrant color. It's got that blue-green mix and this is going to stand out against your skin. And again, what we're looking for in the colors I'm talking about here are ones that you can wear. Not every guy can pull off this color, but you can. And, by the way, gents, don't forget down in the description of today's video, I'm linking over to that article, to that ebook. It actually is going to have 25 colors for every skin tone. Sorry, I couldn't put it all into one video. That would have been like a two-hour video. Yeah. All right. For the next skin tone, olive skin, the first color we've got here is the dark sea green. Now, this is a muted green that really works well with the yellow undertones we normally see in your skin type. Another color that works for you in the brown hue is going to be a dark tan. We're talking a bronze. This is a deep warm brown that harmonizes with your natural colors. After that, we've got a unique gray tone which is known as pale top. Now, if you can find this color in a suit, it's going to look really good on you. But this color right here, it's a classic gray with a warm undertone that works really well for that olive skin without washing it out. Now, what about for the brown skin tone, gentlemen? For you, my friend, look to the color crimson. Now, this is a deep vibrant red that stands out against brown skin. If you've got the courage to wear this, this provides a rich striking contrast and I guarantee you're going to get compliments. Next up, let's go over to the green hue, specifically the color emerald. This is a deep vibrant green that provides a stunning contrast with your skin. And, again, most men cannot pull off this color. You can. Now, this next one is in the red orange hue and we're talking the color rust. Don't let the name put you off. It's an absolutely beautiful color. And it's going to be a bit more muted than the other ones we talked about. And that deep orange red, it's going to accentuate your natural skin tone and just make your skin glow. Now, what about for the man that's got dark? You've got deep colored skin. Well, you, my friend, are descended from royalty because the hue you can wear, the one that looks great on you, is one that very few men can pull off and that is gold. Now, this is a luxurious bold color that is incredibly striking. You got to be careful. Don't wear it all the time, but when you want to get compliments, you want to stand up from the crowd, you want to just make your skin pop. Gold is a color you want to gravitate towards. Now, over in the blue hue, you could look at royal blue. This is a bright deep blue that pops against that dark colored skin. All that being said, if you know your history, the true color of royalty because it was one of the hardest colors to produce is going to be out of the purple hue and that color is dark violet. And seriously, gents, if you don't know the story, so the Greeks, I believe they had to kill thousands of these like sea snails to be able to get this particular purple color and it was toxic and people \u2013 yeah, it was very expensive to get this color into their clothing. And thank goodness we don't have those issues anymore, but this color still makes you look amazing because it's deep, intense purple. It looks regal, luxurious especially against dark and deep skin tones. I've built thousands of wardrobes over the last decade and I have found these laws to be indispensable if you want to create a timeless wardrobe that works for you. So, if you're tired of struggling, putting outfits together, you want to know these. First up, we've got the timeless style equation. Fit times function times fabric equals timeless style. Now, this law is built off the principle of this style pyramid. Now, the key to understanding the power of this equation is to look at the multiples and to realize that if you fail in one of these, it can lead to catastrophic failure across the board. So, you may have nailed the fit. You may be wearing a really nice quality \u2013 maybe it's great gear, nice track suit, but here's the thing, you're required to wear a suit, not a track suit. So, you failed when it came to the function. So, guess what? You get a zero there and across the board, your whole style, your outfit gets a zero because you failed in one of the key components. Next up, we've got the style law of interchangeability and this allows us to get more out of less. So, if you have four pairs of shoes, if you have four shirts, if you have four pairs of trousers and you have four jackets, 16 pieces of clothing, but if they're 100% interchangeable, you have a total of 256 outfits. And this concept alone can transform the way you shop, the way you build your wardrobe and the number of outfits you're able to get out of it. Now, let's address the situation. Let's look at the need. Let's look at where you're currently at. First up, we need to know your why. What's driving you? There's usually three reasons why somebody's rebuilding a wardrobe. First up is you've had a change in your career. Maybe you've gotten a promotion, you've taken a new job. Now, the second reason a lot of people rebuild their wardrobe is it's a new chapter in their life. Something has happened, something has changed and you really need to level things up. Now, the third why is one of the tougher ones and this is where you're in a rut where you just want to change things up and you think that style could be that catalyst. It can be, but here's the thing is that you do need to take action because everything we're going to talk about next in this video, it is great in theory, but it means nothing unless you actually act on it and that's the key. All right, so you've got your why. Now, let's start going through your clothing. We're going to assess what you have. You're going to have four piles. You're going to have love it, you are going to have live with it, you are going to have loathe it, and you are going to have lose it. So, leveraging the power of the L's, the easiest place to start is the foundation of your outfits, your shoes. Right here, you want to go through and immediately again identify what is a lose it. These are going to be things that don't fit you, they are beyond repair, they just choose you don't even know why you've been keeping them, go ahead and throw those out. Take them, whatever it is if they're in good shape. Now, when it comes to loathe, I get that you spent a lot of money on those shoes and they just are not your style. You just don't wear them, you don't like them. I want you to go ahead and create a box for the load. You're going to put loathe right on it and you're going to put the date because everything that you load that you just have been hoarding you don't want to get rid of, you're going to put into that box. In worst case, you can open up that box and grab it at a later point. Key here is we need to get this out of sight, we just need to get this out and we need to start the timer on it because in a year when you haven't used it, you're not going to feel bad donating it. But if you do need to pull it out, hey, it's there for you. Next up, let's look at the work horses. These are probably going to be most of the shoes in your wardrobe from your running shoes to your casual shoes, definitely your casual shoes, even maybe your dress shoes. You've got these and you've had them and you wear them and they work and maybe they're even a decent company, decent build, but you know that, yeah, you just don't love them. Why? Because in one pair, you just wear those and they look amazing. And it's a small detail for you, maybe it's a bit of a broken, it's the detail of the style, it's the overall look, the color, the way that you've gotten compliments on those shoes every time maybe they're two-tone. And this is what you want to build off of. Ideally with your wardrobe, everything eventually becomes a love because when you can do that, when you've got shoes you love matched with trousers that you love matched with a jacket matched with shirts that you love, all of a sudden you've got a combination, you've got an outfit that is friggin awesome. And even if just half the items in there are love and the other half are just, you know, hey, these are work horse, these are just, you know, they get the job done, you're still going to have an outfit that makes you feel like a million bucks and that's what we're shooting for. So, you went through your shoes, now it's time to go through everything else. You start going through your jackets, you start going through your dress shirts, you go through your casual shirts, you start going through all the items in your wardrobe. And, again, what we're looking for is to get rid of, to clean things out, to give ourselves a little bit more room so we can assess and the things that should remain after you've gone through that. Again, even your underwear and your socks you're doing the same thing. You are going to, hey, I live with this, I love it and that's what should remain after you're done with this exercise. So, now, take that loath box, you've got it full, maybe it's even a couple boxes. Again, you seal this up, you date it, you put it to the back of your closet or you put it in storage. But, let's start going through the live and the love. Most likely, your wardrobe is much lighter, much smaller, you're going to be able to start looking at things that you want to assess. Why do you actually love the items that you do? We've all got an idea of who we are and that individual style and some people are going to be more creative, some people are going to be a little bit louder, some people are going to go for more patterns, brighter looks. You want to find what you have naturally been drawn to and start to write this down. In fact, let me know down in the comments your go-to color. Why? Oftentimes, it's maybe something that repeats the color in our eyes. I know for me I love earth tones. Dark greens. I like browns. I've got brown eyes. But, if you've got blue eyes, if you've got green eyes, you start finding that certain things just worked with your skin. Again, you've received compliments on those items you're wearing, but we're assessing why do you love the items you do. Now, the next step here is to start piecing outfits together. We want to see with the blocks, with the pieces that you have, what can you assemble? So, you probably got maybe rid of a lot of your shoes, perhaps you got rid of a lot of those shirts that just didn't fit. All of a sudden, you're finding that, you know, I am really deficient in these certain areas. You need, let's say some new dress shirts. You do not actually have a suit that fits you. In fact, because you have lost so much weight and it cannot be adjusted, you know, you really need to get one because you are in your forties, you're in your thirties. You know that you're going to get invited to a wedding, you know, God forbid a funeral. Things are going to happen in your life and you want to make sure you're prepared. So, you've got a little bit of time, too. You can start to look. Notice how we're going back to those basic rules. If you want to save money, you want to have something before you need it. And based off of, you know, just what happens in life, based off of my career as well, I know I'm going to need more of dress shirts. I know I'm going to need more suits, but if, you know, we're talking more of a casual wardrobe here, I think for a lot of you guys, it's going to be having maybe shirts that aren't so loud. It's going to be maybe be Henleys. It's going to be polos. It's going to be sweaters, adding a lot of jumpers to your collection as they're called over in the UK. Maybe get, you know, nothing against a hoodie, but get rid of those ones that are super loud, have a crazy pattern, were stained, didn't fit you well. All of a sudden, you get something that's solid, something that looks better on you. And just overall, this is where you're going through. You're right now and you're starting to assemble these pieces. You're starting to assemble the outfits. And don't be afraid, you know, I like laying things out. You can even try them on. And hopefully, by the way, when you went through and you assessed what you live and you live, you got rid of anything that didn't fit you. But, yeah, you can just lay things right out there on the floor on your bed and you can start to see what outfits you can form. Now, at this point, you should have noticed the constraints in the outfits that you're trying to put together. Where in a sense could you add an item and all of a sudden get a big multiple? Because think about it, if you've only got one pair of shoes, but you've got ten shirts that are all interchangeable and work together, you're going to get a lot higher of a return by investing in a new pair of shoes, maybe even a couple pairs. But you want to look at what you love, you want to look at actually what you wear and say, can I upgrade it? So let's say you do have a couple pairs of shoes and you've got a pair of boots that you wear all the time. But if you wear boots all the time, why not upgrade those boots? Because you got those one go to and they are your rockstar boots. They're just ones that every time you wear them, you get compliments. But you can't, you know, they're not practical maybe for day-to-day use, but you do say, you know, maybe I can upgrade to, you know, a nicer pair of boots, upgrade my work boots, maybe get a couple. There's nothing wrong with having a couple in the same style, maybe going for different colors, you know, if you really like that style or changing things up. It's just a slightly different style. Right here we've got, as you can see right here, the eyelets on the outside. This is more of a hiking type of boots. Yeah, having fun or just saying, you know what? I do like the high top, but I want to go with something a bit more casual. Again, if you're going to wear it, if you're going to get the miles out of it, if you know that, hey, this has been pretty much, you know, my go-to, this has been a workhorse, but I want to make sure it should be not something I have to live with, it should actually be something I love. So I bring in a pair of shoes that every time I put them on, I feel like a million bucks. And that's where you know to make the upgrade, where there is an obvious constraint and where you're deficient, where you've got maybe you're stronger in something else, but you know you could add something there and it will bring a big return. It's really just going to give you more outfits. Again, I don't want to be a dead horse here, but I want to be ultra clear. If you've got ten shirts, if you've got seven trousers, if you've got five jackets, but you only have one pair of shoes, you know, do the quick math on that. You are only going to get this many outfits again and again. And if you were to bring in just two more pairs of shoes, so you increase to three, look at what you've done for the overall number, you know, the math, that's the way the math works. Versus, if you kept the shoes at one, but you added two shirts, notice how the end number did not go up actually that much. So this is the key point is you want to notice in the area of your wardrobe where the constraint is at and then upgrade it and preferably upgrade it to an item that you love. So, something you guys may be wondering, well, how does this fit into a capsule wardrobe and how does that all play with everything you've talked about? It was first coined the word capsule wardrobe by Suzy Faux in the 1970s and the idea here was basics that could be mixed and matched. Then in the 1980s designer Donna Karen, she actually put out a set of clothing designed to be a capsule wardrobe for women. Now, men's wardrobe designers eventually stole the term and I think we've perfected it here at Real Men Real Style by breaking the capsule wardrobe into three parts. As you can see here with this simple Venn diagram, we've got direction, interchangeability and quality. When you have all three of those things in your closet, you've got a capsule wardrobe, a set of clothing that's going to enable you to get more outfits from less clothing. And with that being said, let's dive right into this. So, first up, direction. What do we mean by this? The direction that you want to take this wardrobe. What message do you want to send with your image? And believe it or not, even with relaxed dress codes around the world, there are still professions, there are still positions in which the clothing you wear sends a signal of who you are. If you're a lawyer in a construction firm, it doesn't matter that everyone else in the construction firm dresses down. The thing is you are the lawyer. You're making sure that everything is great in the contracts. These are multi-million dollar deals you're expected to dress like an attorney. The next key concept in the capsule wardrobe is interchangeability. I've actually talked about this a lot on my channel. So, going deeper on the idea of interchangeability, how do you make sure that the items that you're buying are all going to work together? One of the first things you want to do is make sure that you're going with the same level of formality. If in general, you've determined the direction is going to be a bit dressier, you work in a banking institution, you're a consultant, you're a lawyer, you're wearing suits, then bringing in casual shoes is not going to be part of that particular capsule wardrobe. You can have multiple capsule wardrobes, by the way. You can have one that's more casual, you can have a capsule wardrobe that is more formal. But, assuming that we're sticking with one, you want to make sure that the formality level of the items is about the same. It sounds obvious, but so many times I see somebody falls in love with that item because it's on sale or it looks really good as an individual piece, but it's not going to work with the other items in their wardrobe. If you got a very casual wardrobe, it doesn't matter how much those dress shoes are on sale. You don't have anything to wear them with or any occasion, so skip them. Next up comes color. This is where so many people fall in love with things that are a little bit shiny, things that draw a little bit of tension, things that they think have a bit of, wow, there's a pop to it, I got to bring that into my wardrobe. The reality is, gents, is that the vast majority of items in your wardrobe are going to be boring base colors. If you compare it to painting, these are the colors that are basically just going to set the stage. We're talking white, that's going to be about 20% of your wardrobe. Gray is going to be about 18% of your wardrobe. Blue is going to be blue, 14% of your wardrobe. Black, 13% of your wardrobe. True blue, 12% of your wardrobe. Brown, 10% of your wardrobe. And right there, we're at 87% and we haven't thrown in really any bright colors, anything that stands out. Now, why go with all of those bland colors? Because they're easy to mix and match, they're easy to form the base. And believe it or not, those bright colors that a lot of people think are really fashionable, they like to draw attention with, it's like salt in seasoning. You don't have to add a whole lot to an outfit to make it pop. Now, with that remaining 13%, how would I feel it? I know for me personally with my colors, with my complexion, 7% I'm going green. Why so much green? Well, that is one of my favorite colors and I just find that it's a nice way to fill my wardrobe with certain shirts, maybe a jumper here or there, a jacket here or there. Green is just something I gravitate towards. I then give purple about 2%, red about 2%, orange 1% and gold 1%. All that being said, again, you can change this up depending on your personal preference, your complexion. Now, we can't talk about colors without talking about patterns. In general, patterns I keep reserved when you're just starting off and you're building that capsule wardrobe at the beginning, especially when it comes to trousers, when it comes to jackets, anything that's going to be a large expensive piece, you want to keep in general solid. That being said, once you've got a base of, hey, I've got three pairs of solid shoes, dark brown, medium brown, tan, I know I like browns, so maybe you can go with the two-tone. Maybe you can go with something that brings in a little bit of suede in that with your fourth or fifth pair. When it comes to trousers though, I am very careful, very conservative here. I think that just go with solids the majority of the time. When it comes to patterns, the easiest place to bring them in shirts and accessories. And the reason being is these you can take a little bit more risk with, you can usually own more of. And they aren't as expensive as some of the core pieces I was talking about earlier, like footwear, trousers, jackets, shirts. You can have a little bit of fun with that especially stripes, small repeating patterns that almost look like a solid from a distance. Accessories, that's where you can bring in dots, paisleys, brighter colors. Now, let's talk about quality. When it comes to quality, you should expect you're going to have to pay more to get better. Isn't always the case and there are ways around this. But in general, when you buy quality, yes, you're going to cry once about the price, but you are going to love it and it's going to look great on you and you're going to get your money's worth out of this item because it's going to last longer. And particular items like shoes, like leather bags, those actually develop character. Over time, they get better. When it comes to watches and certain accessories, these can actually increase in value over time. Now, one of the most common questions I hear about quality is is there a way to get high quality at a low price? The answer is yes, but it can be difficult. There are two things that you got to pay attention to here. First, your knowledge of what you're looking for of the products of style should be high. In addition, if you've got plenty of time, a high amount of knowledge, you can be on the lookout for some great deals and occasionally find them. You'll find certain businesses that are going on a business and they're having 50% off and you can spot that that is a quality sports jacket. You can spot those are quality may choose from a brand you respect, you can pick them up. All right, gents. So, to start things off, I want to share with you some photos from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s. Yeah, good looking guys, right? But did you notice how you can actually date those photos based off the clothing? Now, compare that with these photos right here. Yes, I know if you're a detective, maybe the background, you're able to pick up or you know who these people are or maybe it's the hairstyles, you're able to get close on the date. But, for most intents and purposes, these guys look like they could walk out of these photos and they would be perfectly dressed in 2023. And that right there, gentlemen, is the difference between trendy clothing and timeless clothing. Now, at this point, you may be asking, well, why does this matter to me? Well, gents, I'm here to tell you that if you know the difference, first up, it is going to save you a lot of money when you're out there building your wardrobe. Next up, you're going to look more attractive as you choose clothing that complements your strengths. I also want to point out that if you understand the difference between trends and timeless style, it's going to enable you to dabble into fashion even if you don't think of yourself as a stylish guy. And at the end of the day, this information is going to help you dress with more confidence and get more compliments. So, when I say trendy clothing, I'm talking about fashionable clothing, modern clothing that is in a trend. And we see trends go up and down over time. Usually, it's one to a couple seasons in which people are wearing this particular item, this particular color. Timeless clothing, on the other hand, is not affected by trends. In fact, it is shown that it doesn't really go out of style. Now, of course, if you know your history, you know that everything eventually goes out of style. But, there's an interesting effect here. It's called the Lindy effect. And it's the longer an item has been around, the more likely it is to last going into the future. An example here is the necktie. In the last 30 years, the wearing of the necktie has really declined. Sales have been going down, but what's interesting is we're seeing it start to trend again. But the point is if you look back on history, the necktie has been around for hundreds of years. Now, of course, anyone that studied human history can say, hey, looking back over a thousand years, yeah, clothing has changed quite a bit. But the idea of timeless clothing in general is that it's not going to shift much over the next decade. You can buy a suit now and if it fits you, if it looks good, you can be assured that in 10 years, this suit will still be able to be something you can wear. So, now, at this point, let's get into guidelines. These are going to help protect you from making stupid mistakes when you're out there trying to bring trends into your wardrobe. First up, understand where do they come from? Most trends are manufactured, meaning that you've got the fashion industry, you have clothing manufacturers, everyone working kind of in cahoots to say, you know what, we should go with this color this season. A lot of this is created by and that's one of the reasons for the runways and stuff is designers are coming out with ideas. Next up, let's talk about trends and their time periods. How long they stick around? You can have trends that are around for a few days, other times trends that are around for a few years. Next up, let's talk about money and trends. So, dollar for dollar, if I were to compare timeless items with trendy items, you are going to pay more for the trendy item and you're going to get less in terms of quality and build. And this is just because most trends, they're basically trying to get it from idea to the market very quickly. Now, let me be clear, I'm not against you going out there and spending money and picking up trendy pieces. I think they're fun, but that's, you know, they're more of an injection of energy and color than they are as your base foundation. And your base foundation, that's going to be the items they're going to be in those very neutral palettes. They're not going to grab a whole lot of attention. They are basically the foundation of everything else. While you can just add that little bit of trend, that little bit of spice and it'll actually you'll be able to even see it and people will be able to pick it up better. All right, so now let's get into particular trends that we are going to be seeing over the next few years. And I'll give you my thoughts, my opinions on each of them. First up, baggy clothing. In particular, a lot of baggy trousers. So, we saw high-waisted trousers over the last few years. Now, they're getting really baggy. Is this going to work for most body types? The answer is no. Now, definitely it can work for some. And again, if you're a fashionista, you want to pull this stuff off, go for it. But I think for the majority of men, you're going to want to stay away from overly baggy clothing. It really doesn't look good on any build. That being said, there are going to be looser fits. There are going to be some companies that will slightly make things looser. And for a lot of you guys that have been having to deal with tight fits, this is going to be a godsend. You're going to be, you know what? Finally, something that feels good, that looks good and this will apply to suits, this will apply to jeans, this will apply to shirts. So if you find something that has a little bit looser fit, you're gaining a little bit of weight, just, you know, I want to feel a little bit more comfortable in my clothing, then go ahead and pick up something in this category. Next up, let's talk about the no shirt, no problem. I, yeah, okay. Anything that you're seeing right here, all of these photos are things that you probably want to avoid unless you are getting paid to be a model. And actually, and in that case, you really need to ask yourself, is this the best decision I've made in my life? Because it, yeah, this just doesn't look good. Next up, we got V-necks. So the deep V-neck, you want to avoid this, but V-necks in general look good on so many men. Why? Because they build up the chest area. Now, if you have a huge chest and you don't want to draw any, like your he-man shape, in that case, yes, this is probably something you don't need, but for the majority of men, me included, a V-neck just looks so great especially, you know, you layer it with a dress shirt, aka collars and co. Point being is find a way to bring in V-necks. Take advantage of the options that are out there. And they're going to see tons of sweaters. You're going to see shirts popping up and, of course, eventually they'll go on sale. So having a black V-neck t-shirt, white V-neck t-shirt, just a great option. And such a \u2013 if you only have tried crewnecks, you're a little bit \u2013 you're 40s, 50s, definitely go try one. They just look good especially if you get a nice well-fitted t-shirt henley or technically not a henley if it's a V-neck. You know what I'm talking about. Find those V-necks and have fun. Short shorts. Nothing wrong with short shorts especially if you understand they're casual. So, you're going to be wearing these things in the beach, you're going to wear them to work out. And, again, if this is your go-to and you've got great looking legs, have fun. But understand many body types, thin men, large men, this is not going to be a great look for you. That being said, again, you're going to have more options out there. You just need to understand that this is a casual style piece. If you're in the athletics, you like this style. Nothing against the man showing leg, but for the majority of men, this fashion trend, these styles are not going to look that great. Next up, the western style. You're going to see a lot of hats. You're going to see a number of different types of shirts, not necessarily a bad thing. And I do think a man should experiment, have fun. You moved from Texas to, I don't know, no, not you didn't, you'll leave Texas, nobody leaves Texas. I left Texas actually, but let's say you relocated down to Austin like, you know, 10 million other people, you want to bring in a bit of style. Nothing wrong with now jumping on this trend, having fun. The next thing is this is such a, I love western wear, but be careful and I would recommend instead of picking up the trendy stuff, just go to a classic western wear store because you're going to get much better deals. And, again, this is an item that's been in menswear for, you know, over 150 years. So, you can find some great deals. You don't have to just buy the trendy stuff. Again, dollar for dollar isn't worth it. Now, I'd go for and buy just higher quality stuff that you're going to find at classic, you know, western stores. So, when you dress old money, typically this means adopting a style that exudes a sense of timeless elegance, sophistication, and wealth. So, based off that definition, we answered the second question because it just makes sense that people would want to give a signal of, hey, I'm timelessly elegant, I'm sophisticated and who knows, maybe I could be wealthy someday. But seriously, gents, building an old money wardrobe in my opinion is smart because you're building a wardrobe that isn't going to go out of style. Appian said there's a similar trend called quiet luxury, which on the surface seems to be about the same thing. However, it is not. A key characteristic of old money style is it's going to rely heavily on classic timeless pieces that signify old school wealth that's been in the family for generations. Now, quiet luxury, on the other hand, doesn't seem to imply generational wealth. In fact, in many people's minds, the only reason the trend exists is because of the show succession and how the words have been trending on TikTok. However, if you define quiet luxury as unique, personalized, and exceptionally refined garments that are oftentimes commissioned in small batches and made bespoke by craftsmen, well, by that definition, this trend has been going on since the Middle Ages. Seriously, go back to the Renaissance and you'll see oftentimes the difference between those that were higher up in society and those that were lower weren't the colors or the styles, but the materials being used and the detail of the craftsmanship and the build quality. This would result in two garments that looked incredibly similar, but were priced difference by a multiple of a hundred. Starboy What the f*** is a starboy aesthetic? Well, apparently it's a sleek, moderate, edgy style, blending streetwear, high fashion and retro styles together. And here, I thought starboy was a member of the Teen Titans. But, seriously, gents, this has been a style that's been trending and I have to say that when done right, it looks pretty good. Even if it does kind of have a funny name, well, with the color palette, you want to keep it dark. Colors like black, navy, charcoal gray, and you can bring in accents like shades of purple, shades of green. Now, the overall look you're shooting for here is to create a sense of mystery. Dark, stylish, edgy, a bit of intrigue. As far as footwear, we see high-top sneakers or rugged black combat boots. With accessories, we keep it minimalist. Rings, necklaces, sunglasses, and hats. Next up, we've got the athleisure aesthetic. Also known as the gym bro look. The idea here is a sporty look that shows a commitment to fitness and well-being. Not just because you're wearing this clothing doesn't mean you're going to exercise or even healthy, but hey, it's comfortable, right? In athleisure, as many of you guys know, it's been one of the fastest growing segments in the last 15 years when it comes to menswear. Which believe it or not, I'm not going to condemn because I love the fact that a lot of this is seeping into other parts of menswear and our clothing is becoming more comfortable because of performance, fabrics, and stretch. Now, as a subsection here, I'm also going to throw in the tech professional aesthetic. The key with these clothing pieces is they're leveraging the latest in technology, meaning that they're made to work with your tech and they're probably tracking you. From Meta's partnership with Rayban to smart watches from Apple to the wearables that are tracking what we're doing throughout the day. Now, what about the soft boy aesthetic? Has anyone heard of this one? Again, I think this one's been trending over on TikTok. The name to me just isn't appealing. I just imagine like someone that's really soft, which apparently is the point of look. It's geared towards someone that's a bit more sensitive, a guy that wants to come off as approachable as artistic. Now, a lot of the clothing pieces seem to be classic, but the color palette is going to be a little bit more vivid with pastels, although muted tones still make up a big portion of the wardrobe. Next up, we've got the designer demon. And as the name implies, this guy wants you to know every designer brand he's wearing. Therefore, the logos are large and they are in your face. Now, on the opposite end of that, we've got the earth aesthetic. Now, let's not confuse this guy with the granola aesthetic. That's where you look like you haven't showered for a week because you haven't. Seriously, the earth aesthetic, I really like this one. It's casual, but it's all about those earth tones in the colors. So, first up, those earth tone colors. We're talking greens, browns, beiges, and creams. Of course, black, gray, and white can also fit into the base, but it's really going to be those natural colors that this guy likes to bring in and just gives you a feeling this guy wants to be outdoors, which he probably does. Next up, let's talk about the work wear aesthetic. Some guys don't like this because they're like people are wearing this, but they're not actually working. To each his own, I'm not here to judge, but I do remember when I used to climb radio communication towers, that's how I paid my way through college. I wore dickies because I couldn't afford car harts. Those, I mean, they were great, but, yeah, that was work wear when it was work wear. Now, the color palettes here, as expected, are going to be earthy, are going to be neutral. You're going to find colors and the material and the stitching made to resist stains and heavy wear. Some of you guys may be thinking, Antonio, are you finally going to change your hairstyle? Over the years, I've had various lengths. I've combed it in different ways, used different products. But, yeah, for the most part over the last decade, I have had the same hairstyle. So, is it time for a change? Well, the answer is most likely not. I think for the majority of us, it's good news because it just goes to show as a man you don't have to jump on the next hair fashion trend. Seriously, you just need to find the style that suits you and occasionally play with the lengths the way it's comb, change out the product you're using. But, overall, unless you go with something extreme, the classic hairstyles are always going to be in style. So, for me as a side part guy, I'm safe. But, what if you want to level up your style? Step up your image. How do you find the perfect haircut for you? Well, the first step, gents, is to consult with a professional. Yeah, I know that's why you're watching these videos or better yet, you're actually watching videos by hairstylists on YouTube that are showing you all these different styles, all these different looks. But, here's the deal. Nothing beats an in-person consultation with somebody that can actually look at your hair up close, but even an inexperienced stylist who's been working for one year. Well, this person at least gives about ten haircuts a day, has worked, let's say, 200 days in the last year. Gents, that's 2,000 haircuts and at least a few hundred heads that this professional has worked on. Oh, and they also went to school and studied this stuff and most likely they enjoy this line of work, hence why they got into it. My point is even an entry level professional knows a lot. So, if you can call around and find a haircut professional that's passionate and takes their job seriously enough that they have no problem shampooing your hair and talking with you and explaining to you with your particular hair type. Gents, this one action finding a great stylist or barber can totally transform your look because the reality is when you see a celebrity with great hair, they're not just walking into a barber for the first time and giving them explicit directions on what to do. Not like anything that matters, they are working with a professional who takes care of them and helps them find hairstyles that work for them. Now, the next key to getting the hairstyle you want is being able to talk to your barber in their own terminology. So, when you say fade, understand that this is a gradient of hair length typically shorter at the bottom and gradually longer towards the top. Variations include low fades, mid fades, and high fades. Now, a taper is similar to a fade, but more subtle. With a taper, the hair gradually gets shorter around the sides and back blending into the top without a drastic contrast. Next up, let's talk about the layered cut. What exactly does this mean? So, a layered cut is when the hair is cut at different lengths throughout creating layers that add volume and movement. A lot of guys have been cutting their own hair and it's gotten longer, they don't know how to layer. And what happens is all of a sudden the hair starts to poof out at the bottom. Simply put, the hair on the top of the head is actually longer than the hair on the sides. However, when this hair is properly layered, all of a sudden it's going to lay and flow differently and create which I think most of us would agree upon is going to be a more desirable look. Now, a textured cut is a style that incorporates layers and choppy ends to add texture and movement to the hair. And if you hear about a haircut being disconnected, this is a clear distinction between lengths such as an undercut or a hard part where there is no gradual transition. So, disconnected haircuts, you can clearly see where the hair has been cut. Now, what are hard parts? They're out of style, but if you ever hear the word, understand it means a shaved line on the scalp creating a distinct part in the hair. Now, what about a fringe? So a fringe is where the hair is cut and styled to fall on or across the forehead also known as bangs. Now, past this, we start to get in different haircuts. On the shorter end, we've got the buzz cut which is an even very short cut all around the head achieved with clippers. Now, the crew cut is a short haircut where the top is slightly longer than the sides which are usually tapered or faded. Now, the Ivy League is a variation of the crew cut where the top is long enough to part and style while the sides are kept short. And the comb over is a bit longer and it's where the hair is parted on one side and combed over to the other often used in combination with a fader taper on the sides. So, you're speaking your barber's language and if that still is too much work, one of the hacks that I love is simply having a picture of me with a great haircut with the style that I want to go back to. Now, this doesn't work if you want to change up your hairstyle, but if you stick with the same hairstyle, then have that picture so you can quickly pull it up or better yet have a video especially after the last time you get a great haircut and you just love the look of it. So, you've got that next time or maybe in six months if you got to change up barbers. Now, I think it's really important when you're choosing a stylist when you're choosing a barber as I talked about at the beginning that you get along with them, that they actually are going to make time for you especially if you're changing up your style and you're not sure exactly how to style it because this person is a professional in a matter of seconds. All of a sudden, you're looking at your hair and you're like, wow, this is great. So, apparently in the oral hygiene industry, there's an argument that's been going on for a decade and that is which tongue scraper is more effective? The num chuck scraper or the do it all tongue brush? Apparently each side has its devotees and this disagreement has split families. Gents, I'm here to prevent a civil war by telling you the answer is to use both. Seriously, especially if you've got deep tongue grooves like me. Now, my routine is I like to start off with the brush. Right after that, I use the scraper on the brush to go over my tongue once. Next, I bring the num chuck scrapers. This I'll run over two to three times to get all that nastiness off. That gentleman is how you clean your tongue. Next up on the list, hammerhead scissors. Now, technically these are called rounded edge scissors or safety scissors, but I like to call them hammerheads because it just sounds cooler. But that's beside the point. You're wondering why do I need to own these? Because scissors like this are going to prevent a lot of bad things from happening when you need to get to a hair in an area that's relatively sensitive. We're talking the nose, ears, eyebrows. Seriously, look at these incredibly sharp looking cuticle scissors. You want to take a chance to put these up your nose or even near your eye? And speaking of your nose, a dedicated electric nose hair trimmer is a must. My personal preference are those outfitted with side cutters. The next screw we told that every man needs to have an anti-hemorrhagic. What the heck's that? I'm talking about the styptic pencil. Basically, this is a silver nitrate stick. So, whenever you cut yourself, you can nick yourself with shaving. We're talking minor nicks. You go over that and it stops you from bleeding. Guys, I promise you, this tool is life changing especially if you shave a few times a week, you routinely get nicks and cuts. Guys, this right here is just going to stop the bleeding and it's so much better than just putting toilet paper on it. Next up, we've got trimmers. Tons of different options out there. As you can see here, I've got some sideburn trimmers. These are really nice especially the wider edge type because they allow you just to get a really straight nice look on your sideburns. And in a pinch, these can also work on the back of the neck. Now, of course, just a regular pair of trimmers can get the job done and really it comes down to your personal needs as to which tools you should purchase. Personally, I do like the smaller trimmers for the detail work including cleaning up my eyebrows. And speaking of your eyebrows, this is something your stylist or your barber can take care of when you visit them, but it is nice to be able to get rid of, yes, those random long hairs. I don't know how in the world I got a two-inch hair right there in the middle of the eyebrows. It's like this thing was just hiding there and popped out one day. Now, what I don't advise doing is plucking your eyebrows. That being said, flathead tweezers and needle nose tweezers, I will add to this list is I think they're essential very useful tools, but in general, you don't want to be plucking your eyebrows. The exception would be if you've got a unibrow for me. In that case, a little bit of strategic plucking is fine. But in general, with your eyebrows, you can use those flathead scissors to get rid of any rogue hairs that, yes, are going beyond an inch or you could even use hair product. Yes, a little bit of hair product right here on the eyebrows to keep them in line. And speaking of hair product, tons of options out there in general you're going to find you've got high hold, low hold, high shine, low shine. I've got a chart right here that kind of breaks out all the different options you have, but don't forget about the importance of your brush and a comb. Now, the funny thing about brushes and combs is that most guys make a decision about this when they're a teenager and then they never change it. Seriously, gents, you can experiment hair. There are all different types of brushes, all different types of combs, and they actually have different effects on your hair. Some brushes are going to comb your hair straight down, other ones are going to create texture. And combs are really nice not only because they're portable, but they can help you get that perfect part in your hair. Seriously, just look at these skills. Look at me parting that hair right there. Isn't that perfect? And now, let's talk about water picks. This is a new tool I've fallen in love with and any of you guys that've ever had braces, you know the power of a good water pick. And it just makes your teeth feel so much better and it can just do things that, yes, floss can do it, but water picks do it so much better. Now, as you age and this can start in your 20s, your skin starts to go through changes. One of the first ones we see is your skin starts to get thinner. All of a sudden, you're just not replenishing it this quick. So the average layers, it just starts to get thinner. We also see your skin starts to get more brittle. So, what can you do at home to make sure your skin looks good? Well, first, never use bar soap on your face. You want to use an actual face wash. You see, a hand soap to have one purpose and that is to clean. And although you want your face to be clean, the unintended side effect of this is it can lead the skin incredibly dry. Not a great look for the face. A face wash on the other hand is going to have a moisturizer in it and it's going to maybe pull back a bit on the hard cleaning ingredients. The result, you get a clean face without the dryness. The next tip is to apply a moisturizer. First thing in the morning, preferably with a sunblock. And if you can't find one that you like or apply them separately, but this combination is key to preventing age spots. Now, for men that spend a lot of time outside especially not protected from the sun, you can start to show age spots in your 30s. However, most men, me included, will start to show them by our mid-40s and into our 50s. Now, if you do want to minimize age spots, I do recommend speaking with an esthetician or dermatologist. But, there are many over-the-counter topical treatments that contain ingredients like retinol, hydroquinone, and vitamin C. These treatments over time have been shown to reduce pigmentation. And as mentioned earlier, if you're looking at micro abrasion or lasers, again, go see a professional. Now, this next mistake applies to you guys out there that have a beard or are growing a beard. Poor beard grooming. Now, when you're in your 20s not taking care of your beard, make sure look a little bit sloppy. In your 30s, 40s, 50s, it can make you look tired, old, and washed up. So, first up, you got to take care of the neckline especially if you're a taller guy, everyone is going to notice. Basic trimming, making sure you don't have loose hairs, that you have an overall even growth that looks sharp, that looks clean, that looks like you put some effort into it. And by the way, I do know the mustache is back and even if you're growing it by itself, guys, you don't want it fully covering the lips. So, yes, your mustache, you want to maintain, keep it clean. Now, what about neck hair? What about sideburns? Again, when you're in your 20s, you're a starving student, yeah, it's okay sometimes to look like you're going eight weeks between haircuts. But, if you're in your 50s out there on the dating scene, you want to look put together. So, in between seeing your barber every few weeks, have a pair of tumors and make sure to straighten the hair on the side of your face and the back of your neck. Now, we hinted at it, but I want to go a little bit deeper. Let's talk about gray. Now, some of you guys genetically, you're not going to start to gray to probably in your 50s. On the other hand, some of you guys start getting gray hairs in your 20s. And, yeah, now you're 35 and you're mostly salt, not much pepper left. Now, graying is it happens naturally I think is normal. But people's perception of the color gray with hair is that it does age you, which works for some men. But, if you feel that it's not working for you, I highly recommend you go see it a professional at least one time because there is a huge industry on the women's side when it comes to coloring. And when you go see a professional who has colored thousands of people's hair, they'll be able to give you a better perspective. They know the best products on the market. And for a relatively paltry sum, you'll be able to see what the best can do versus if you try to go cheap and do it yourself the first time. Which I know there are different options out there and some of the gradual programs are pretty good, but I have seen it when a guy buys a cheap dye doesn't know what he's doing and colors his own hair thinking it's going black and he ends up going purple. Yes, I have a friend in the 60s who went from gray to black with a purplish tint. It was hilarious. And, by the way, this applies to your facial hair as well. Now, this next mistake has been made fun of so many times in movies I'm surprised that guys are still making it. And that is they're trying to hide their bald spot with a comb over. Now, for some guys hair loss is gradual, but you got other guys that happens in a matter of a year. Now, if you are experiencing hair loss and you want to stop it, there are options out there, but if you're not going to do anything about it if it runs in your family, you pretty much know what's going to happen. Then, the path I would recommend here is finding a hairstyle that doesn't deny baldness is happening, but instead leans into it and embraces it. And the silver lining here is when you lose the hair on top of your head, all of a sudden you realize, hey, I got to protect the top of my head. So, I find a lot of guys going bald discover the power of hats from flat caps to Panama's to trilby's. Now, the funny thing about when you're losing the hair on your head is that the hair starts to pop up in other places. All of a sudden, you got it flowing out of your nose, out of your ears, more on your back. Now, I'm not saying you got to be body-scaping all the time. That is a personal choice. But when it comes to the ear hair, when it comes to the nose hair, I would suggest you do us a public service and take care of those follicles because you don't want to look in like a forest. Again, especially if you're a taller guy, everyone's looking up to you and they can see those bushes coming right out of your nose. Now, the ear hair can sneak up on you. It's a little bit harder to spot. I would recommend though every time you go see your barber, just have them trim those two spots in addition, the eyebrows. Seriously, you've ever noticed on a really old guy how the eyebrows, he's got these crazy long hairs that are going everywhere. Now, mad respect to the guys that are growing that eyebrow hair and actually styling it. But for the rest of us, what you want to do is just set up a routine to go through and trim it. And we're not going to be like some of the ladies out there plucking out all the hairs and then drawing them on our face. No, just treat it like your normal facial hair and keep it under control. Next up, let's talk about your oral care. Looking at somebody's teeth, this is the easiest way to determine their age. As you get older, your teeth are naturally going to get stained and are going to yellow. Now, with today's dentistry options and over-the-counter whitening treatments, you can hold the staining and yellowing at bay for pretty much the rest of your life. But if you've got really bad teeth, the enamel is pretty much gone. One option and I know it's expensive, but, man, it can really transform your look is to look at veneers. This is a process where they basically rebuild your teeth and if done right, it can make you look years younger. That being said, you don't have to go extreme. Just go talk with a cosmetic dentist because I know guys in their 50s that have gone in and straightened their teeth and it's made a huge difference. Not only the way they look and feel about themselves, but actually as many dental professionals will tell you, it enables you to chew better and your teeth are going to last longer. So, let's talk about your nails. Let's talk about your cuticles. If you don't know what cuticles are, that is the skin that grows on the side and around the nails. And as you age or some of you guys deal with this because of hereditary reasons, you could actually the cuticles can come off and this can be very painful. Now, some people are born with bad cuticles, but a lot of guys just have bad habits of chewing their nails or picking at their cuticles which initially they can get away with, but as you get in your 30s, 40s, 50s, it can really make your hands look bad. Now, I've seen guys try to break the habit using a clear nail polish that tastes horrible, but the best method I know of that you'll actually enjoy is actually pay and go in and see a nail professional. Yes, get a manicure. Yes, get a pedicure. Treat yourself. You only live once. See what it's like. But, here's the deal. When you spend money on something like that, most of us are going to say, you know what? I am not going to chew on these nails because I spent good money getting them to look good. And, yeah, when you get invited to that pool party and you're wearing flip flops or sandals, you don't have to be embarrassed of the claws on your feet because you're, yeah, your feet will look good. So, the first step to finding your personal style as a man is to do a self-assessment asking these four questions. First up, you're going to identify your lifestyle needs. This is your daily activities, profession, hobbies, your social events, where you live. All of this plays into the clothing that you're going to want to look at. A finance professional on the East Coast is going to have a very different wardrobe than a finance professional down in Houston. Or a creative up in Chicago where St. Louis is going to have a different look, a different wardrobe than perhaps that same creative living down in Southern California. Next up, we want to define your style goals. This is the message the clothing says without you having to open your mouth. Seriously, look at these pictures right here. We got the same guy, two different outfits, two different messages being sent. Now, of course, there's going to be a difference in professional and casual clothing, but even your casual clothing, if you are a professional man, you're going to want to still descend a message so in case you run into somebody on your off hours. Now, the third self-assessment step is to actually take out the clothing in your wardrobe and to actually look at what you're starting with. Most of them are not going to have to rebuild their entire wardrobe. And, in fact, your existing wardrobe, there's a lot of items that we can identify for good fit. Yeah, you like this shirt, it's a little bit worn out, but you love the overall fit and feel of it. Well, guess what? We're going to look at that brand. We're going to look at the measurements of the shirt. Even if you were to get something custom made, we can actually use that shirt as a block which is basically a template to make more. There's also going to be certain items in your wardrobe that you just get compliments on. You keep them because you love the color, you love the material, you love something about it. And that's something that you want to take note of and repeat again and again as you look to make purchases. And, of course, let's talk money. You're going to want to set a budget, but a realistic budget. So, it's going to be important that you look at clothing prices and you understand all of your options. You also want to identify the priorities. Like any other guy, I like good underwear. But before you buy expensive underwear, you want to make sure your outerwear such as your shirts, your trousers, your shoes, and your jackets are of good quality because that's the thing that most people see. So, now, we're getting into the fun part. This is where you really develop your personal style. And the first thing you want to do is you want to identify your icons. These are the guys that you are inspired by. You've seen them in a movie, you've seen them in a magazine, maybe you're following them on Instagram, whatever it is, guys, start to put together your list and it really helps if they've got a similar complexion, if they're maybe a similar age, if they've got a similar build, maybe you're a big heavier guy. You got a little bit of a belly. Well, fine guys that are large and in charge and dressing in a way that other men are just, you know, wow, like this guy, yeah, he's big, he's heavy, but he doesn't have a big belly. He does not look sloppy. No, he's large and I love that, large and in charge. That's what we want, right? Or maybe you're short and stature. Find a guy who stands tall because he's got the confidence, he knows he looks good. Every time he walks in the room, he owns it. Guys, that's what you do when you find your inspiration, you find someone you can connect with who just simply it's like, you know what? I want to steal his look. Now, the second tip here is you start to experiment. And this is one of the hardest things for a lot of guys because when I say experiment, there are going to be failures. You are going to put some outfits together that you're going to be like, ah, that's not so good. Well, guess what? That's why I love it when you can take a picture, share it, a group, get a little bit of feedback. Or if you don't want to do that, simply wear it around the house. A lot of guys talk to me about, hey, I want to get into wearing a hat. What I always recommend is wearing the hat around the house because when you become used to it because when you feel you don't even notice it's there anymore, guess what? You're going to walk out not even knowing the hats on your head or wearing that shirt that you don't normally wear a collar and nice shirt like this. And you're just going to go out and run some errands and someone's going to say, hey, wow, you look really good. What are you dressed up for? And you're going to say, oh, I'm dressed up for you. Just simply, yeah, this is the way I am. I'm looking to be my best self. I'm just, yeah, I just wear this stuff all the time. Now, the third part here is incorporating unique elements. I really like it when a man brings in his heritage. So, for me, my father, he's from Guanajuato, Mexico bringing in a wyebara I think is really unique if you've got a Hispanic heritage. Or maybe your grandfather is from East Africa and you want to bring in the Dishonor. And I know you Scottish guys are out there always talking about the kilt. Is there a way that you can bring that into your wardrobe or maybe just bring the tartan pattern into one of your jackets, a pair of trousers or something unique? The idea here is that you know who you are, you know what you stand for, you know your heritage and even if it's just a custom piece of jewelry, I love to see a man have fun with his style and be able to bring in a little bit of his own history. Now, up to this point, most of the work we've been doing is right up here. You shouldn't really have spent too much money. Instead, what we've done is we've changed your perspective and your understanding of style. In fact, the goal up to this point quoting T.S. Eliot, at the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. I point there is when you do the groundwork to improve your understanding of style, you don't see it with the same eyes anymore. A sharpened mind and a trained eye is now going to be able to see opportunity and be able to see what your style could be much better. Now, what about a signature scent? Now, I know you love your old spice or maybe it's Stetson, whatever it is, I've got those fragrances, but look to upgrade a bit. Maybe if you got a little bit of budget instead of old spice, look to Creed Viking. If you're going out, you want something sweeter that draws in the ladies, look no farther than the fragrances from Jean-Paul Gatier. Specifically, that new elixir is frigging amazing. And, if all that sounds like too much, you just want versatility and class in a bottle. Check out either Tom Ford's Baud\u00e9joire or Herm\u00e8s' Age 24. Baud\u00e9joire, why I love it? This is classic barbershop and the Age 24, it's that metallic note. There's just something that reminds me of the gun range. I love it. Next up, practice, evaluate and evolve. Now, it seems obvious, but the key to finding your style is not thinking about your new style, but actually putting it into practice, wearing the new clothing, trying it out, putting together the different combinations, experimenting. It's like riding a bike. You've got to do it. Yes, you can watch tons of videos on riding a bike. You read a book about riding a bike, but nothing beats going out and doing it. The same comes with discovering your style. You put the clothing together, you wear it out, you get compliments, you find events. A lot of people like, well, I'm always stuck at home. Find or sign up for an event to go to. I know for me when it comes to fitness, signing up for a race, signing up for an event really forces you to get in shape and to train. The same thing with style. How about you actually set it up so you're taking your girlfriend to one of the nicest restaurants in town? Or maybe you're a father of three. I get it. You're incredibly busy. Well, still take your wife out on a date night or maybe take your daughters to a father-daughter dance and actually get dressed up for it. And your goal is to be the best looking guy for your little girls so that you can show up for them. Now, when it comes to evaluate, you are going to be your worst critic. And don't always listen to the voice in your head. Really listen to what other people especially the people that matter to you, what are they saying? Does your girlfriend, does your wife do your friends? Like, man, you looked really good. Well, guess what? You're trying to build you up, but also they're probably being honest. You do look better. So, don't be so hard on yourself. That being said, if you look at the pictures, you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're like, you know what? If I brought this jacket in a bit, if I hemmed those trousers, maybe if I tried a different color or this color looked really good on me, that color so-so, this is where you evolve. You evaluate what you see and you work to get better. And as many of you guys know, if you're just getting 1% better every day for a year, by the end of that year, you are 37 times better than what you were at the beginning. So, there you have it, gents. The step-by-step guide. And, again, down in the description of today's video, I'm going to link over to where I've got it all laid out with pictures, details, so that you can actually have this guide absolutely free in our community over at Real Men Real Style on school.

        "transcript": " Today, we're embarking on a special journey through time and tradition, exploring the essential elements that craft the ultimate gentleman, style, scent, and substance. From the historic cobblestone streets of Victorian England to the modern bustling cities of our world, the marks of a true gentleman remain timeless. Together, we'll discover how these elements go beyond mere looks and smells to forge a persona that stands out, crafting a way of life that's not only stylish, but also profoundly impactful. Join me as we peel back the layers of what it means to be a true gentleman, from the precise tailoring of his suit to his choice of fragrance and the integrity that defines his character. We're not just talking about dressing sharply, but about living with a sense of grace and strength that's evident in every step you take. Let's begin with style. The elegance of a gentleman's attire is timeless, transcending passing fads to embrace a philosophy where less is more and refinement is key. Bo Brummel, the progenitor of the dandy style in early 19th century England, revolutionized men's fashion by introducing the modern suit and tie, shunning the ornate attire of his time. He championed a wardrobe that celebrated understatement, yet demanded attention. The modern gentleman's wardrobe is built on a foundation of quality over quantity, a well-tailored suit, the versatility of a trench coat, and the understated sophistication of brogues or oxfords are essential. Next, we explore scent, the invisible yet unforgettable accessory of a gentleman. It's a subtle art form, a personal trademark that precedes and lingers. In the courts of Louis XIV, known as the Perfumed Court, nobles were required to adopt a unique fragrance as a mark of their presence and status. This tradition underscored the power of scent to command a room without saying a word. A gentleman's choice in fragrance should reflect his personality and lifestyle, whether it's a robust leather, a crisp citrus, or a deep woody note, each scent plays a role in his narrative. Gentlemen, I'm thrilled to introduce you to something truly special, the Brotherhood of Scent Community. This unique space is akin to the esteemed Real Men Real Style community, yet it's exclusively crafted for enthusiasts eager to explore the fascinating world of fragrances. I've meticulously designed this free community to offer more than just courses. It's an extraordinary distraction-free haven where you can immerse yourself in the science of scent. Here, you'll discover the premier community for fragrances, equipped to empower you with the invisible power of scent. This is more than just about smelling great. It's about enhancing your presence and becoming the man you know yourself to be. Don't let this opportunity slip by. Sign up now and join the ranks of the Brotherhood of Scent Community. Finally, substance. The true depth of a gentleman is not visible to the eye, but it is felt by all who encounter him. It's about integrity, wisdom, and the courage to do what is right. Substance has always been at the heart of influential leaders and thinkers. Abraham Lincoln, known for his eloquence and leadership, exemplified substance through his dedication to justice and equality. Today, substance means being well-informed, cultured, and thoughtful. It's about being a man of action whose words and deeds are consistent and rooted in strong ethical values. As we've seen today, the ultimate gentleman's lifestyle is an art form cultivated through meticulous attention to detail in style, a thoughtful approach to scent, and an unwavering commitment to substance. It's about creating a legacy, a way of being that inspires respect and admiration. So, what video to watch next? Well, gents, I've got you covered with this one. Boom, right here. Check it out, solid video. I know you're going to love it. Seriously, guys. Good video? Boom, click it. Magically, you will go to the next video and I will no longer have to hold this up. Come on, it's getting heavy. Click. Come on."

        "transcript": " So, the other day, my son and I, we slow cooked our first brisket. Now, as any Texan will tell you, there are a million ways to screw this up. Emotional damage! Yeah, if you don't smoke the brisket right, you're going to end up with a slab of meat that's undercooked, overcooked, dry, raw, burned. And you can get all that in one slab of meat that, by the way, is incredibly expensive. But despite all the things that could have gone wrong, I'm proud to say after 24 hours and as a Texan myself, I was very impressed with the results. Now, I'll admit we did use a pellet smoker and I'm a bit biased, but that doesn't negate the results and brings up the question, how did we get so close to perfection on our first try? Well, the answer is, well, we watched about half a dozen highly ranked YouTube videos on how to cook a Texas brisket. And we did find one in particular that we both resonated with and we just followed the directions the gentleman gave to the best of our ability. Yeah, it turns out that learning from others who have been there who are experts is a great way to increase the likelihood of your success and avoid mistakes. So, my question to you, when it comes to living a good life, what instruction manual are you following? What system? What process is keeping you on the right path? Who are you learning from? Who's coaching you? What map are you following? Do you have a compass to show you the way? Is it even working? Do you know what to look out for? The warning signs to preventable mistakes. The uncomfortable truth, gentlemen, is that the majority of men out there are living a life without direction. They're going through life based on randomness, chance. There's no design. There's no clarity of purpose. There's no proven map with the destination. Now, some of you guys may be saying, Antonio, that sounds nice, but I got to pay rent. I got to make money. I got to put food on the table. I'm trying to build my career, maybe even find someone to spend my life with. No, I totally get it. Physiological needs, safety and security, love and belonging. There was a guy in Maslow years ago that talked about this, the hierarchy of needs. And if you're focused on this bottom three, you're not thinking a whole lot about your full potential. But, here's the deal. When you start to feel comfortable with your physiological needs, with your safety and security, with your love and belonging, all of a sudden the next two, fulfilling your self-esteem, reaching self-actualization, these needs start to feel as real as the bottom ones. And if you haven't aligned the other areas of your life with building your self-esteem and reaching self-actualization, the incongruity here, the lack of alignment, can lead to a crisis. So, how to start living to your full potential? So, to quote Jimmy Buffett, I've been seeking the answer to that question that has bothered me so. And in my case, I first looked to frameworks, to first principles. The reality is there's a million hacks, a million things out there that you could be doing, but I knew that I needed to focus in on the most impactful, like the Pareto principle says the 20% that yield you the 80%. Next up, these principles needed to be proven both by research and I would prefer them to be time tested. So, the older the principle is, the more I liked it. And finally, with these principles and techniques, they had to align with my view of the world, with my experience. They had to make sense to me. The result, I'm calling it the HWP-10 system. Yes, I know not the best name, but it's what I came up with right now. In a nutshell, I've got three areas of life in which I stay focused and with that, I've got ten habits that apply to each of those areas. Now, I created the system over the last decade for me. I've read a lot of self-help books, a lot of religious text, a lot of philosophical text. And I paired this with one of my favorite series of books, the Aubrey Mouturn series which is a 21-book series of nautical historical fiction. So, here's how all this makes sense. As an analogy, you are a ship out on the open ocean. This is you traversing the world dealing with storms, dealing with waves, and like a ship, you are made up of various parts. First, we've got your health. This is the whole of the ship. Now, for any of you guys that have sailed, you know that it's the whole of the ship that gives the ship the strength and stability to weather the storm. It's the backbone. It's the frame. It keeps the boat from taking on water. A strong hole like strong health with a man is required to be able to live a good life. Next up, we've got wealth. These are the sails of the ship. They're the engine. They're what propel the ship through the water. Your sails like wealth provide speed. They provide momentum. They provide the ability for you to be able to cut through the waves and reach distant destinations. Without wind, without sails to catch that wind, the ship will stall. And finally, you've got purpose. This is your ship's navigation system. You have a compass. You have a clock. You have a map. You have stars at night. All of these tools help you find your way on a vast ocean when you're dealing with waves, storms, and darkness. Without your purpose, without your navigation system, you would drift aimlessly no matter how strong or fast you are. And notice how these three components are inseparable. Without health, you don't have the energy to build wealth and to go after your purpose. Without wealth, you don't have the strength or security to go after improved health or your purpose, what you've been put on this planet for. And purpose, although it seems like it takes a backseat to health and wealth, it's what makes the whole journey worthwhile. In fact, as you get older, you realize that purpose is really the driving force between you taking care of your health and your wealth. Now, if at this point you're saying, well, this sounds really interesting, but I don't need another YouTube video telling me what to do, I actually just need to do it. If that's you, you're looking for a like-minded group of warriors out there looking to live their best life to reach their full potential. Well, down in the description of today's video, I'm linking over to my new group, Health Wealth Purpose. Now, straight up, this group is really small. I interview every single person that makes their way into this group because the reality is most men aren't ready for what we do in this group. It's daily accountability. It's improving yourself 1% every day to become the man you know yourself to be. We meet up weekly via Zoom. We've got a set course that we're following and this ain't no three-day course. We're talking a minimum three-month commitment. So, if you're interested, check it out. I've got a link to HWP down in the description of today's video, but if not, no big deal, just enjoy the video. All right. So, now, let's talk about the ten habits and each of these apply to the HWP, your health, wealth, and purpose. So, first up, you've got to discover your North Star. You need to have clarity on what you want out of this life. With your health, that means getting specific. You need to define what optimal health is to you, not what society pushes on you. Let's take the craze of six-pack abs and being an 8% body fat. The reality is that's not actually a true sign of health. And if you really think about it, it's probably not exactly what you want or is realistic for your lifestyle and other things you want to include in your life. I know for me, I want to be flexible, I want to be agile, I want to be able to run and keep up with my kids. I want to be strong and mobile into my 80s and 90s. The same thing with wealth, you've got to have set clear financial goals. With clarity on your wealth goals, you should have specific numbers that you're going after. Are you defined by those numbers? Of course not. But, talking and planning in numbers takes the ambiguity out of your planning and allows you to get a lot more specific. With your purpose, you need to define your core values, the meaning that you want to get out of this one life that you're living. Next up, you got to be sailing with urgency. You need to commit to the voyage, know what your why is, and use that to power through. With health, I know for me, it's my kids and my future grandkids and even great grandkids. I want to be around. And I don't do I want to be around, I want to be useful. I want to be somebody that my grandkids actually like hanging out with. That guy in his 90s that's still using his mind providing value to those around him and is able to move around on his own not be confined to a bed. I've seen that and I do not want that future. For you and wealth, what's the necessity there? I know for me, it's about bringing my family together. I want to invest more in real estate and have the type of homes that my entire family can come to and that I can pass wealth onto my children and their children. And your purpose, why does it matter? Now, guys, really quick, I want to be clear. I am not telling you how to live your life. Gents, figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom that anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make up your own mind. Seriously, gents, what I'm providing here is a tool. You have to do the thinking, you've got to determine what's right for you. Steps strengthen your spirit, generate energy. So, when it comes to health, the actions you're taking here should be making you stronger. Find a type of exercise that you love. I know for me, it's calisthenics, it's running, it's going on long walks and hikes with my wife. Comes to wealth when it comes to industry, when it comes to making money, find a path, find a skill that for you is play, but to other people is work. And by doing this, you're literally generating power, you're generating energy in yourself, yet to other people you're getting stuff done. And that, gents, is how you find your calling. And with purpose, when aligned with your health, when aligned with your wealth building, all of a sudden, you're making more energy because everything is aligned, your work is meaningful. The next habit is to brave the storm, to demonstrate courage, to be able to choose the route and you've got the confidence, you've got the belief in yourself that you're going to be able to figure this out so you have the courage to take that chance, to go after, to sail through the storm, to have the courage when others around you are faltering and to be able to reach your destination. The next habit is to lead the crew, to inspire other people to follow you. In health, this manifests itself by you actually leading by example. If you want your partner to get off the couch, how about you set up a date so you actually go on a walk with each other, you go on a hike. You give her what she wants, time with you or even out walking and shopping. And maybe you set a spend limit, but yeah, agree to go to that huge strip mall with her, but insist, hey, let's walk around, let's get a couple miles in as we go from store to store. When it comes to purpose, if you've already got this lined up, you know what yours is. Maybe you can share with others not trying to push it on them, but asking them for constructive feedback. Are you living up to these principles? And the very act of sharing this with somebody and asking for them to give feedback may actually get them to rethink their own purpose as well. The next habit is to find joy in the journey. Now, you may have noticed up to this point, I haven't talked about happiness at all. And my reasoning for this is I don't think happiness should be a goal that you're going after despite what modern society says. So, happiness for me is a byproduct of you living up to your potential. I mean, think about it, the things that have made you happiest in life. Has it been actually getting them or has it been the struggle, the journey, all the work, all the effort that you put into to be able to achieve that goal? But once you get it, yeah, most of us are setting another goal. So, yeah, develop the habit of finding joy in the journey and have gratitude for the health, for the wealth, for the purpose that you do have. Even at this point, even when it's not much, the next habit is to learn to weather the waves to cultivate resilience. A woman named Angela Duckworth wrote a great book called Grit. And I love this because it talked about really what does it take for somebody to succeed. She went over and she studied some of the U.S. military academies and she looked at the people that dropped out. And they couldn't figure out exactly why because they all had pretty good grades. There wasn't any one indicator, but then she started going and looking under the surface and she realized the people that dropped out, they scored poorly when it came to resilience. When it came to the grit as she called it, to be able to deal with all the little things that constantly hit you in life and can drag down a lot of people. But if you've got strong resilience and this is a muscle that you can build, all of a sudden you're able to bounce back from failures because if you're looking to improve your health, if you want to improve your wealth and purpose, you are going to have times in which, yeah, you're going to have failures. You are going to hit walls. You're going to have certain points in which you just stall out. There are certain areas in which you have to start over and it's at this exact point that having resilience and having built up that muscle matters. The next habit you need to cultivate, course correction. Whenever a boat is going from New York City to London, how many times do you think it's thrown off path? Same thing with an airplane, flying from New York to London. How many times? Ten, twenty? The answer is more like tens of thousands of times and that airplane, that boat is constantly having to course correct. New information is coming its way. It's being affected by the outside elements, by the wind, by the weather, by the temperature. All of that forces the autopilot to make small adjustments so it stays on course. The same thing applies to your health, wealth and purpose. When you get that blood results back and you find out, okay, I've got higher cholesterol than what I thought, okay, this is hereditary, but I'm going to need to make some adjustments to the food I'm eating. Maybe to the exercises I'm doing, maybe I need to get more sleep. Same thing with wealth. You wake up one day you're 52 years old and you realize, you know what? I need to have more saved here. I need to make some adjustments. Gents, there's nothing wrong with this. Be open to adaptation. Now, this next habit becomes harder as you get into your 30s, your 40s, your 50s, and I'm talking about evolving as a captain. Being committed to being a lifelong learner because the reality is as you age, your ego usually gets bigger. Hey, I've got all this experience. What can I learn from a 20-year-old, from a 30-year-old? Well, probably a lot if they've got experience in an area that you know nothing about. In fact, my definition of old is somebody that's rigid. Somebody that doesn't evolve. Somebody that doesn't change especially when new facts are presented to them. And, in fact, getting back to that book series I talked about at the beginning of this video, Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturend. What I love about the play of these two characters is that Jack Aubrey comes off as this, you know, cocky. He knows everything new captain, but it's this introduction of this really odd character who becomes his ship's surgeon and eventually his closest confidant. These two guys play off each other and learn from each other. In fact, with the program I was talking about earlier, health, wealth, purpose, we have a mastermind component in it. I was initially going to call it the Maturend mastermind, but I didn't want to deal. I realized, okay, I can't deal with any copyright issues. Point being though is I look at the guys in this group as the Jack Aubreys. They are the captains, the heroes of their lives. My job is I'm this guy over on the side that's going to ask them good questions. It's going to say, have you thought about this? Because when you look at all the information out there in the world, this is what you know, 1%. This is what you know, you don't know that 4% out there. And the remaining 95%, this is what you don't know that you don't know. And the scary part about that that 95%, that is conservative. I'm sure it's actually a lot higher than that, probably like 99.99 because the reality is, gents, to live a good life, this is work. It is hard especially when you go it alone. So, if you're interested in learning more about my like-minded group of warriors out there working, busting their asses to live their best life, check out what we're doing. I'm putting the link down in the description over at Health Wealth Purpose. I've got a short video over there where I explain more about what we're doing. And if there's a good fit, I would love to talk to you about joining. Again, the link to Health Wealth Purpose is in the description of today's video. So, what to watch next? Well, gents, come on. I've got you covered the raw realities of being a man, probably one of the better videos I've made in the last couple of years. I just really, yeah, I get a little bit vulnerable in this video. And I think it's a solid video. So, check it out. If you haven't watched this video, it's been a while since you watched it. But, watch it again, a solid video. I'm proud of it. Go check it out."

        "transcript": " So, imagine being able to buy a new Rolex for 50% off retail. Actually, I know some of you guys are having a chuckle because you can remember the days when you used to be able to get a discount on a Rolex. But, the last couple years especially with the entry level variants, it's a steal if you can get it at retail if you've got a connection with an authorized dealer because the reality is so many of the desirable models are being resold on secondhand markets for markups of 50, 100, 200%. But, gents, what if I were to tell you there's a way to get a Rolex without paying Rolex prices? A brand that has the same founder is Rolex. In fact, this brand for years used mostly Rolex parts, maintain the same quality standards as a Swiss watchmaker, yet to this day still charges one-third what Rolex does for similar models. So, the Heritage Watch brand I'm talking about today was founded in 1926 by the same Hans Willesdorf that founded Rolex in 1905. The watch company I'm talking about today, if you haven't figured out, gentlemen, is Tudor. The watch I went with as many of you guys know was the Black Bay 58. Now, the Black Bay 58 is coming in like 10 variations right now, but the one I stuck with was the 39 millimeter in steel with that black bezel, that black dial, and then, yeah, just that the gold indices really just a stunner of a watch. And the bezel on this thing, don't even get me started. This thing just absolutely so smooth, so nice. I mean, it's even better than the Rolex. I also love that it had a 70-hour power reserve. And, so right there next to the winding crown, you've got this circular satin brushed steel winding crown tube. Basically, whenever you unscrew a winding crown and you pull it out, you've got this little thin piece of metal between you and the watch, I have to say I absolutely love that they've got this protection around it and it gives it such a more robust-like feeling. This is the Monta Triumph. And in case you haven't heard of Monta, this is one of those small niche brands they're actually based out of St. Louis. I know both of the founders, we were in a mastermind together, but before that, I saw some great reviews about this company. I went over and just fell in love with the Triumph. Everything about this watch for me screamed perfection, beauty, I had to have it. Now, the movement is their Monta Caliber M22 self-winding mechanical movement with bi-directional rotor. Now, the hands are Swiss-made rhodium-plated diamond cut sword-style hands filled with super luminova. Now, as you can see, the watch I'm wearing right here does not have the metal bracelet. I went with the leather because I just loved the way it looked. So, the next watch on this list, Blanc Pond's Fifty Fathoms. As the name of the watch piece implies, this timepiece was made to go underwater. You see, diving in the early 1950s was a very new sport. Yeah, people have been going underwater for thousands of years, but with the development of scuba gear, all of a sudden, explorers were going deeper and deeper and things were getting more dangerous. Divers needed a watch that was made specifically for them and met their specifications, especially military divers who needed accurate timekeeping not only to coordinate with other units, but also to survive the deeps whenever they were coming back up. Seriously, if you're not familiar with the Benz, just Google it, man, it is not something you want to go through. In any case, the development of this watch wasn't really commercial for Blanc Pond. This was seen as something that, hey, they're doing a favor for the French military because as their CEO said at the time, he thought the market for this watch was pretty much non-existent. Well, it turns out that he was wrong. In fact, throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, dive watches quickly became one of the most common, one of the most sought after type of watches out there. Next up, I've got the Seiko Prospects. And the reason this one is on the list because when you see it on my wrist, it's a little bit large. I mean, it's a really the samurai it's also called. It's a beautiful watch, just a little bit too big for me. Hence why I don't wear it very often, but it's on this list because I liked it or I like the design of it so much. I ended up buying a couple others, one for Aaron Marino, one for my son. And I have to admit that like all three of us just love the overall design. The bezel, yeah, it is just smooth and I love the hands. The second, the hour hand is really cool on this watch. And just the colors, this one's the Save the Ocean design. Just a good looking watch. That would be oversized for my wrist. It fits really nice on the wrist and oh, just a great looking watch. One, I am very, very happy I grabbed this one. So, the next watch on this list, Hamilton Cacky Field Watch. Now, as many of you guys know, based on a Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Hamilton has been making watches for over 150 years. These guys started with pocket watches. They actually made watches during World War I for the U.S. military and they continued that tradition in World War II. In fact, they've served the military for over 75 years and from 1942 to 1945 produced over a million timepieces for the military efforts. Now, throughout the 1950s, 60s, 70s, Hamilton produced a wide range of field watches. And a classic field watch is one that has a high contrast dial. So, when you look at it, you can easily tell what time it is. Now, a classic field watch usually isn't going to have a whole lot of complications. It's going to be very simple to look at, very simple to read the time. The idea here was you could quickly glance at the watch, get the time, and move on with what you need to do. Over the years, they evolved especially the ones adopted and used in aviation. But, at its heart, a classic field watch is going to be a bit casual, not exactly a dress watch, but it's going to be incredibly functional, useful, and versatile. Now, there's a lot of khaki fields I could have put on this list, but the one I'm actually going to bring up, it's a variation that appeared in the movie Interstellar and that is the khaki field Murph Auto. Now, I actually did get my hands on this watch and I felt the 42 millimeter was a bit large, so I was very happy to see they came out with a 38 millimeter. I've yet to pull the trigger on this one. But, you can see here this is a very simple elegant design. I love the movie reference. If you haven't seen the movie Interstellar, you definitely want to check it out. The point being a classic field watch, this is a timeless one you could add to your collection and yet anyone who sees this watch is going to know this is a classic. Now, really quick, gents, if you are a watch lover like me, you like talking about timepieces, you like learning more about watch history, gents, if that's you, you need to join our free community watch lover.

Next up, we've got Orient and I've got three Orient watches. Let's go ahead and start off with the Mako II and I heard again and again with Dive Watches, this is a great watch. If you're looking for an automatic watch, you're looking for one that has a unique style is good looking and again, great value, you want to look Orient and I have to agree. I love the style of this. You don't like this style, it's not going to work for you, but if you like the style and you're looking for a good value, highly recommend these. Now, the difference between the Mako II and the Ray II, not much. Again, look at the dial and you'll see differences in the numbers and the way, you know, the numerals and things like that, but otherwise very similar watches. Now, I grabbed this Ray III. It was a limited edition and I really like this of all the Orient watches. This is the one I go for. I didn't expect to like that little bit of gold right around here as much as I do. I think it just adds a little bit of pop to the watch and really sets it apart. The other ones feel more sporty, but just a good looking watch and I'm actually very happy to own this one. And with that being said, gents, what video to watch next? How about my watch collection? What are the watches that I actually wear in my collection? I've got quite a few, guys.

        "transcript": " Take a dollar or in this case a twenty and fold it right in half and I want you to take that shirt and I want you to put that dollar at the edge point of the collar. Now, you're going to notice there's some stitching there. What you want to do is count the number of stitches from that end. Now, this length here is an inch and a quarter. If you don't count at least ten stitches, this could be the sign of a poor quality shirt and you're probably going to want to look elsewhere. So, the next trick to quickly identify high quality clothing, look at the buttons. So with jackets, you want to look for horn, for shirts, you want to look for mother of pearl. Now, just because they're using plastic buttons does not mean that it's bad quality, but if they're using horn, they're using mother of pearl, these are much more expensive materials. So, if they're spending the money there, you know that on other parts of the garment that they've spent the time, they've spent the effort, they've created a quality garment. Now, how to spot mother of pearl? So, you want to take the shirt and you want to look underneath the button. What are you looking for here? On the top, it should be very clear, very clean, but underneath, we're going to see these colors, these imperfections. Why? Because these buttons are stamped out of shells. So, as we're talking about buttons, let's talk about the stitching and the shank. So, when you look at the button, it should be sewn on tightly. There shouldn't be loose threads and it should have what's known as a shank. This is basically where the button is sewn onto the shirt in a way that it's raised off the shirt to make it easier to button. And now, let's go to the bottom of the shirt and we're going to look where the front connects to the back and down here, we're going to be looking for a gusset. So, a gusset is an extra piece of fabric sewn into a stress point on a shirt. The idea here is that they're spending time and money to actually go in and reinforce your shirt. A lot of manufacturers skip this. This is a great sign of quality. And let's not forget the gauntlet button. It's going to be right below the cuff on the sleeve. It's going to be a little bit smaller than the buttons that we see on the cuff. Now, the historical purpose of the gauntlet button was to help hide excess fabric as basically you had the larger sleeve head going into the cuff. But functionally, I think it really helps whenever you got to roll your sleeves. So, you always want to make sure you find a shirt with a gauntlet button. And don't forget, check in your collar. You want to make sure that you've got collar bones. These should go in and out made from metal, made from plastic. Doesn't matter as long as you've got that slot there to be able to make sure that you've got a nice pointed collar. So, now, let's talk about the material's most quality clothing is made from. The trick here is to look for 100% cotton or to look for wool when it comes to high-end trousers when it comes to jackets. This isn't going to guarantee its high quality, but it's a great start. Now, why is wool a great thing to look for? Because it's a luxury material that's very expensive. So, manufacturers are going to be careful when they're using it. Now, when you start to see a wool blend, you want to be careful. There are some great jackets out there that are wool blends, but you need to be careful. You need to start looking at other details. Now, when it comes to shirts, 100% cotton is a great start, but you can't depend on it. Why? Because I do think that actually blends that bring in the right material are a great thing. In addition, there's different quality levels of cotton. So, it is something that it's a great start, but you want to look at other factors. Now, what about linen, silk, bamboo? I think those are all great materials. They're good things to look for and when you see it, they're pretty rare. Now, you want to make sure that you can take care of it especially when it comes to silk. But, what about acetates? These are things you want to be careful of. Acetates are made from petroleum, so they're not going to have much breathability. Occasionally, when mixed in with other materials, they can prove useful, but I would be very careful with acetates. Another quick trick to quickly identify quality is to look at the pattern and notice was it sewn in or was it printed on the material. So, this right here, I can look at the details on the fabric. I can see this was actually sewn in. Now, this one right here, it was printed. This doesn't mean it's bad quality, but this right here is definitely a sign of good quality. Another quick sign of quality, look for a split yoke. You want to turn the shirt around and you want to look at the back. Now, all shirts going to have this and if it doesn't, it doesn't mean it's bad quality, but if they got a split yoke where basically it has been cut in half and has been sewn together separate, this is a sign of good quality. It goes back to old school tailoring where they actually used to measure each of the shoulders, each of the lengths here and they would actually make the shirt slightly different for each side. The first trick to quickly identify good quality on a shirt, look for pattern matching. Notice the pattern here with a pattern on this sleeve should match up with the pattern right here in the shoulders. Why is this a sign of quality? Because they had to spend more money on the actual materials. So, it works like this. A shirt is made up of various parts and this forms the pattern. The pattern is laid out on basically fabric. Now, that fabric, they can lay out those parts in a way that they can get the most out of that fabric or they can lay it out in a way in which everything is going to line up and it's going to look best. Now, when it comes to jackets, you want the outside to look great, but more importantly, look on the inside of the jacket. You want to look at the details on the stitching, everything that goes into it here. They should have paid as much attention to the stitching to the basically the finish on the inside as they did the outside. Gents, if they paid attention to the details here, you can rest assured that on the inside of the jacket, the parts you can't see where there's possibly a floating canvas or maybe they used a little bit of glue strategically that they did a good job on that internal construction. So, when it comes to sports jackets, blazer jackets, suit jackets, it's all about the details. Guys, you want to look did they pay attention to working surgeon cuffs right here. This historically basically you should be able to unbutton this so you could roll up your sleeves, perform surgery on the battlefield, but nowadays what this signals to me is that they're only making this jacket in enough sizes. They know they're not going to be able to make it for everybody because when they make these basically functional, you can only adjust the length of the jacket so much about three quarters to maybe one inch versus if the buttons were right here sewn on top, you could go about two inches either way. Now, I also like to make sure that my pockets are functional. I like to use a pocket square, but it's okay if they've got this sewn initially, you should be able to open up then put in a pocket square. Now, right here we've got patch pockets on other jackets. You're going to see flat pockets, but those should also be able to be open and used. Now, when it comes right here to the boot near hold, this should be able to be opened. Sometimes they're not going to have this opened up and on the back here you should have a latch so that you could put a flower in there and it would hold it. Now, if you're looking to level up your style, you really need to check out my free community over on school. I've set this community up. So, we've got free classes that you can make your way through step by step and learn the basic foundations of men style. Now, I have to say the men that are in this group are frigging awesome. We've got to know a whole policy, people treat each other with respect. And what we've managed to create in this community is a place where a man can come in and ask questions and get some solid advice. So, gents, use the link in the description of today's video. Go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. So, now, let's talk about trousers very similar to jackets. You want to look on the inside, you want to look at the finish. Did they pay attention to the inside? Did they stitch everything appropriately? You don't have loose threads all over the place? I like to look at the back of the trousers. Did they give me excess material so that I could open up the trousers later? Here's the thing, this costs money to put this excess material in there knowing that most guys will never use it. But let's say you get a little bit bigger over Christmas time, this is a godsend because all of a sudden you're going to be able to open up these trousers and continue to use them. So, for shoes, the quick trick here is to look at the sole. Is it a leather sole? Right there, that's a great sign of quality. Then look for stitching. Right here I see stitching. So, this tells me it's either a Goodyear welt or it's a Blake stitch. Next, I want to look for tacks. These are small nails that they're going to use in the heel. The heel is made up of layers and layers of leather and they're going to hold it together with basically these tacks and a little bit of glue. Now, another quick sign of quality on the inside of the shoe is going to be an additional layer of leather. This there is for protection. This should not be the same leather that's on the upper on the outside. They should have another layer of a different color oftentimes that it basically in there to protect the shoe whenever your feet are sweating. Now, what you can't see on the inside of the shoe is going to be a shank, a steel shank or a shank made from a different material sometimes even plastic is a good sign of quality. Now, let's talk about luggage, briefcases, bags. The easiest thing to spot here, the number one thing for me I look at is going to be the hardware. That's the zipper, that's the metal pieces used. If they skipped here, you can bet that they went shoddy when it comes to leather. So, go ahead and use that zipper. Does it flow? Does it get caught? Is it something that seems small or is it made? Like overbuilt, oversized, you want to make sure that they spent the money and the time to get good quality hardware. With that being said, gents, don't stop here. Come on, I got another video for you right here. Check it out. Oh, yeah, you're going to love it. Boom. Click there. Go check it out. Solid video. Come on. You're here. You're still \u2013 why are you still here? Click the video right there. Go ahead."

        "transcript": " This is a world where your favorite fashion trends were born on the battlefield. From the classic trench coat to the timeless bomber jacket, men's fashion as we know it owes a surprising debt to wars and military uniforms. What if I told you the reason you rock that pea coat today goes back to 19th century sailors? Strap in because we're diving into how wars have shaped what you wear every day. Have you ever heard of a bloodshed? And no, I'm not talking about some type of cardiovascular disease. No, what I'm referring to are cloth patches that were sewn inside flight jackets that were made famous by the flying tigers during World War II. So, what's this got to do with fashion because it speaks to the legendary status of the A2 leather bomber jacket and the MA1 flight jacket. Anytime Hollywood wants to portray an actor as being strong and venturous, they're going to put him in a leather flight jacket. If you personally just want a functional and good looking jacket, then go with an MA1 flight coat. And beyond the bloodshed, flight jackets were also pioneering in their use of new materials. At the time, they were using a fire resistant polyester type material that was inexpensive to make and to this day, we're seeing used in jackets around the world. In addition, you could turn the jacket inside out. Inside the jacket, you had a bright orange. And we see this reversible clothing all over the place. Why did they use this in the military? Because if you're a down pilot and that helicopter is coming in to save you, you want to be spotted whether you're in the water, whether you are in a dry land, you don't want to wear anything camouflage. So, you're turning that jacket inside out so that you can be spotted by search area and rescue. Let's talk about camouflage right here. Check out this camo kilt. Any of you guys out there kilt wearers, let me know in the comments below. And I want to hear your opinion about camouflage in general. I used to be against it, then I got a pair of camo shorts like this right here. Check out these camo shorts. I find that they are so easy to wear. Yes, they are casual. But when you're wearing shorts, you're casual in general. I find pair of them with a nice dark colored polo, a light colored polo, going with even some nice shoes with this. All of a sudden, I'm having fun. I'm bringing in a pattern that normally is very difficult to match. But when you wear it with shorts and again, you wear it just the solid colored shirt, you I think it looks pretty good. Men's wear item with a strong military history I want to talk about is actually multiple items. We're talking about coats. And depending on what war actually we saw different coats come out of each war and become more popular. I'd love to hear from you guys in the comments which jackets you know had a military history and I didn't cover in this video. But let's go to the Bora war. Initially, that's where we saw the trench coat. But it wasn't until World War I, the trench coat was basically the preferred coat of officers in the trenches made by I think it was Burberry made some of the best ones, the initial ones. It was made with a particular material that made it a little bit water resistant so a man could sleep literally sleep in this jacket, stay somewhat warm and they were a prized possession. So we look at the movie Casablanca. You know, what is he wearing in some of those iconic scenes? A trench coat. Many of these men came out of that war keeping their trench coats wanting to get more use out of them just loving them. It's been an iconic piece ever since. The duffle coat as well out of World War II, we saw the duffle coat a very warm heavy coat something that can still to this day actually be worn with suits. Also out of World War II, we saw the bomber jacket. Now, the bomber jacket, other variations known as the tank jacket, this is where the jacket was cut shorter because a man needed to be able to get in and out of a tight spot. Imagine a guy going on a bombing run and wearing this jacket or perhaps being in a tank. In any of these cases, he needs mobility at the same time he's got to be able to stay warm, especially for those bombers up at a high altitude. Why in the world are Europeans starting to wear bracelets with clocks on them? Nowadays, we call these wrist watches, but back in 1916, you had pretty much only pocket watches and they were not very common. You had to have money to have a pocket watch because let's just face it, the intricacies they were all handmade, this was something that was a big deal. It was a status symbol. Pretty much you either had a lot of money or you worked in a profession like you operated a train and therefore, you needed to be able to tell the time so there wasn't going to be any accidents or anything like that. Point being is that this was something that very few people had, but when you're on the front 1914, 1915 trench warfare, these military officers all had watches. This was something that they bought themselves and they were trying to figure out how to best carry these things because they didn't want to be pulling them out of their pockets. You're about to do a charge and you wanted to make sure everything was lined up. Timing had to be perfect here. So in that case, all of a sudden, they're basically finding ways to strap them to the wrists. They were taking bands, they were taking bracelets, they were actually even affixing them to their clothing. Per military request, a number of wrist watches were commissioned and after the war, the wrist watch started taking off. It became a fashion trend and to this day, it has now replaced the pocket watch and wrist watches even if now they've gone high tech are something that we still see that men and women will love and wear. From the combat boot, we've seen many variations. Initially we saw the Chaka come out of the desert boot. This was of a British design popular during World War II and now we see a wide range of companies that make them in suede or leathers or other variations, but it still is something when you find them with a rubber sole can actually be very comfortable and was made to be something to be able to wear in warm or weather at the same time give support to the ankle. Belts and suspenders weren't just for holding up your pants. They were actually there to provide support because you are armed. You were actually carrying a sword. I was using this as a belt. The suspenders were there as well to be able to distribute the weight. If you look at old military uniforms, you'll notice that they're actually have pouches on the suspenders and that it puts the weight over on the shoulders which is much better than trying to hang it on the waist. So your suspenders and your belts have a military history. Now, this next fashion trend was started by a military regulation change in 1913. Before then, undershirts basically had buttons on them and they since the 1880s they've been using this design. It wasn't very comfortable and it wasn't very functional. Well, the military said, you know what? We need these guys working cleaning, you know, the top of decks and stuff on boats. So let's give them a piece of gear that is simple and that basically frees up the arms. The t-shirt was invented. 1913 original designs were actually made from wool. They took a long time to dry. It just wasn't a great design. But eventually within a period of about five to ten years, we saw that transition to the cotton t-shirt as we know it. And they went with white because it was incredibly cheap. It's about 1920. We saw the white t-shirt all of a sudden it was \u2013 and this was underwear. This was not something that was shown. It wasn't until the 1950s that we saw the white t-shirt all of a sudden being worn under a leather jacket on the big screen that all of a sudden t-shirts started coming into their own. And then the late 1970s, 1980s, we saw the fashion tee all of a sudden putting, you know, a little slogan or logo or something. I love New York across the tee. All of a sudden made it something that people would wear every day. Cargo pants. They became popular during World War II simply because they're practical. Think about it, with a regular pair of pants, you've got that high pocket, but you've got to lift your jacket up. If you had a cargo belt on or you had lots of things on here, it's a little bit hard to lift that up and reach in. Cargo pants were actually at the length of your hands, you could just reach down, grab extra ammunition, maybe food over on this side. And because of that, they're still in uniforms today. Now, in civilian wear, do I think that most people should be wearing cargo pants? I think they're a little bit overdone. But I do think that there are stylish ways to still wear cargo pants. The next fashion trend coming out of the military, the classic aviators. So, this goes back to 1929 Army Air Corps General McCready. He basically noticed this pilot's were starting to get headaches. They're flying at higher altitudes. Just the rays, it was just really affecting him, the sun. So, he said, hey, we need to design some type of protection. That's where the aviators came from. And they've got that classic design that basically covers the entire eye socket. That was the big thing. In 1936, they started selling these to the public and they started becoming popular. We saw them in a variety of movies. James Stewart wore them in the 1956 film, The Spirit of St. Louis. Peter Fonda wore them in the amazing 1969 film, Easy Rider, but it was 1986's Top Gun with Tom Cruise that put aviators on the map as the has to. Basically, anyone that's anybody that wants a pair of sunglasses, aviators are where you start. They're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, they're expensive, you know. In the description of today's video, go check out our free communities on school. These are for you to become the man you know yourself to be. The suit jacket I'm wearing right here, this has a storied military history. Go back and look at old dress uniforms, even look at modern-day uniforms in the Marine Corps and the U.S. Army in the United States Navy. You will recognize many of the features on a classic suit jacket. That's because the classic suit jacket came out of the military uniform. If you look at this right here, maybe put a few pockets right here, put some medals right here, this could be an epaulette, epaulettes right here. All of a sudden, you've got a military uniform. The Marine Corps we actually had, used to have leather about a hundred maybe 150 years ago right here, which would protect you from a not well-placed sword slash. If it was well-placed, you probably can lose your head. But the point being is that the clothing we wear today has a military history. Yes, even that suit. Next up, let's talk about neckwear, specifically ornamental neckwear. We're talking about the necktie because you think about it, what functional purpose does a necktie serve? Well, the answer for over 2,000 years is it brings color, it disrupts pattern. It actually is a great identifier of what unit you're with. Going back to 200 BC, we look at the Quinn dynasty, those terracotta soldiers. Guess what? They are wearing silk cords around their neck to identify what units they're with. Roman legionnaires wore scarves not only for protection, but again to identify what unit you were with and your rank. In Europe's 30-year war, Croatian mercenaries serving in the French military wore scarves. They wore these neck pieces that were, yes, decorative and just simply to show who they were with and what they were about. If you think that this is old-fashioned, you ought to do your research on regimental neckties and the different type of club neckties out there still worn over in England and the UK. This is something that, hey, some people will take in a front. If you're wearing their colors, if you're wearing their unit and you didn't serve, if you didn't go to that club because it used to be, we'll go back 1910, you pretty much you were only allowed to wear neckties that you had actually earned. So, you went to this school, you were part of this club, you had served in these regiments, you therefore could wear these colors. If not, well, good luck, you were just wearing something plain. The turtleneck sweater. Now, the turtleneck sweater was around well before World War II, but it was the secret service, the Submariners that made it popular especially in the movies after World War II where these guys, you know, they're in a cold cramped submarine. And what better, you know, from what better outfit than a turtleneck sweater that's going to fit close to the body, have a tight knit weave, so it's not going to grab onto a lot of things, keep them warm and be something that they can wear again and again get dirty, it's still going to look okay. So, when we saw a number of the movies, it became popular in the 1950s and the 1960s and to this day is a menswear classic. And let's not forget about khakis, chinos, that tan color that we see on men's trousers around the world and women have adopted it as well. This actually comes back 1845. We had the English over in India and they realized, you know, what these white pants are not great, they're too bright, we need to go for something a little bit darker that's going to better fit in. In fact, it was 1848 that they officially adopted this as a color. They were using different dyes, it was relatively inexpensive and it really made sense in camouflage. Now, the United States didn't figure this out until about 1898 in the Spanish-American War, all of a sudden we started adopting khaki. Again, we saw this pickup and become part of regular uniforms just you know office uniforms with the military throughout World War I, World War II, and it then bled over into America, just regular college wear in the 1950s. To this day, khakis, chinos and the use of the color tan are a staple in men's fashion and women's fashion around the world. So, this is the color tan, it's a very common color tan, it's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. It's a very common color tan. Military uniforms around the world. Who's got the best uniforms? Well, I think it's pretty obvious who's got the best. But, find out what I say in this video right here. I also rank some really bad ones, but, yeah, I enjoyed this video. It's a good one."

        "transcript": " Gents, I did a poll on my community tab about what is the biggest style myth and the results were actually interesting, I should say it. So, let's break down all five and start thing off with the most voted one. Black shoes go with everything. Black shoes are traditionally associated with formality and are best suited for evening events and formal business settings. Wearing them during the day can sometimes appear too rigid or overly formal. Black shoes, however, blend seamlessly with earthy tones creating a more cohesive and visually appealing silhouettes. Number two, watches are only for telling time. Sure, watches serve a practical purpose, but they're also an essential accessory that can elevate your style. Luxury watches are also admired for their intricate craftsmanship and engineering. Watches are often handed down from parents or grandparents and become cherished family treasures. Ever wondered how this small piece of machinery works or why these are selling for hundreds of dollars to millions of dollars in the market? Watches, these intricate marvels of engineering combine both form and function. This community is exactly for that. Whether you're fascinated by the complex mechanisms or the luxurious designs, we have something for everyone. You can be a beginner and we got courses for you to get started. If you've been collecting watches for years now, we want you to share your knowledge. When I got more than 70 plus watches and the best part, the community is absolutely free to join. You just need to answer three simple questions and you are good to tick into the community. Come and drop your watch of the day or ask questions. Everybody is welcome. Down in the description below, I'm leaving the link to our new watch lover community. Number three, blazers are only for formal occasions. Blazers aren't just for formal occasions. They can be dressed down with jeans or chinos for a stylish casual look, versatile and adaptable. Blazers elevate everyday outfits, suit various seasons and work well in business casual settings, making them a key piece for a trendy polished wardrobe. Number four, older men shouldn't experiment with fashion. Take Jeff Goldblum for example. At over 70, he's known for his bold eclectic style, often mixing patterns and wearing vibrant colors. His fashion forward approach proves that style is ageless and experimentation can enhance personal expression at any age. And finally, number five, pocket squares must match your tie. Your pocket square should complement your tie and suit not necessarily match them exactly. Different patterns and colors can create a more interesting and sophisticated look. Gentlemen, what video to watch next? Boom! I got you covered with this one right here. Check it out. Come on. It's getting heavy, guys. Now, I can do it. I was already lifted this morning. Oh, yeah. Actually, I'm just doing squats nowadays, maybe some overhead press, but this is relatively easy. I'm just going to click. Boom."

        "transcript": " When you think of military uniforms, you probably imagine something practical, tough, and maybe even a bit intimidating. But what if I told you there are military uniforms out there that are, well, let's just say, a bit unconventional? Today we're diving into the unique world of military uniforms, focusing on some of the weirdest and most fascinating examples from around the globe. Each uniform is not only a piece of clothing, but also a chapter of history, brimming with cultural significance and unusual features. From skirts and pom poms to colors that pop, let's see which uniforms make it to the top of our weirdness meter. Kicking off our list at a weirdness rating of 7 out of 10 are the Evzones of Greece. These presidential guards are known for their iconic uniform featuring the Fustanella, a pleated skirt comprising 400 pleats representing 400 years under Ottoman rule. The footwear, the Zaruhis, are clogs with large pom poms weighing over 3 kilograms each. The combination of traditional skirt and pom pom adorned footwear makes their appearance not only unique, but steeped in deep historical pride. With a weirdness rating of 8, let's head over to South Korea to take a look at the Royal Palace guards. Donning vibrant colors and traditional handbok with silk jackets and wide trousers, these guards' uniforms are accessorized with belts tightened across the waist and traditional hats, often seen during ceremonial duties at the palaces. The elegance of these uniforms is enhanced by their historical significance as they mirror the attire worn by palace guards during the Josian dynasty. Scoring an 8.5 on our weirdness scale are the Yeoman Warders or Bee Feeders of England. These ceremonial guardians of the Tower of London wear a uniform that dates back to the Tudor era featuring deep red and gold tunics with white ruffs and elaborate medallions. The antiquated style, seemingly plucked from a Shakespearean play, serves as a walking history lesson on the Royal Bodyguards of the 1500s. Now, with a rating of 9 out of 10, let's talk about the Mongolian State Honor Guard. Their uniform is an incredible sight featuring brightly colored, traditional Mongolian attire complete with elaborate embroidery and vibrant patterns that reflect the rich heritage of Mongolia. These guards wear a high-collared, brightly-hued tunic and boots suited for the rugged steps, adorned with historical symbols and intricate designs that highlight Mongolia's proud warrior tradition. Gents, if you want to step up your style efficiently and effectively, look for a proven path. It's also great if you can surround yourself with like-minded men because how many times you've tried to learn something and there are other people that don't want to be there, they're distracting you, which is why, gents, I wanted to show you this free group that not only has instruction, but an amazing community that is distraction free. It's got a great app. I've got courses in this community that I used to sell. You can get for free. I've set up prizes. I've gamified it. Guys, I'm going to link to it down in the description. Or if you just want to go over to the URL, it's at school.com slash rmrs. This group is free although you do have to answer three questions. I don't ask for your email address. I simply want to make sure that we keep spammers out of the group. It's a high-quality group. It's an amazing community that I am proud to give to you guys. Using our Weirdness chart with a rating of 9.5 out of 10 is the Swiss Guard of the Vatican. Allegedly designed by Michelangelo, their uniform is a medley of vibrant colors, blue, red, orange, and yellow, arranged in a manner that resembles a Harlequin's outfit. This Renaissance-inspired attire includes puffy sleeves, rough neck collars, and striped knickers, making it look like they've stepped straight out of a Shakespearean play. But don't be fooled by the colorful garb, these guys are highly trained and seriously skilled. They might look like court gestures, but they're as tough as nails. From the historical skirts of the Evzones to the Harlequinesque panache of the Swiss Guard, these uniforms challenge our typical perceptions of military dress. Which uniform did you find the most bizarre? Let us know in the comments below. But, guys, check out this video next. Also, I talk about other military uniforms from around the world that you need to check out some bizarre ones. If you enjoyed today's video, you're going to love this one. I go into a lot of detail, a lot of history, and I think you guys are going to love this video. So, go check it out, guys, if you're interested in military uniforms, history, and my thoughts on it."

        "transcript": " Jodiper, Mocktoe, Harness, Lager, Motorcycle, Combat, Hiking, Broke, Work, Classic Lace-Up, Chelsea, and Chuka. And that's only half my list. Gents, when it comes to boots, you've got choices. What style should you go with? What color and material should you choose? Should you choose a style that's a bit eclectic or go with one that's tried and true? Well, gents, the first step to finding the perfect boot is to identify your needs. First up, what's the purpose? Why are you buying the boots? Are you buying these boots to wear them to work for casual activities or for outdoor exploring? And let's not forget the climate. Do you need boots that can handle snow, rain, or heat? And don't forget, what do you already have in your wardrobe? Are you buying a pair of boots for the first time? Are you replacing an old pair? And what's the style of the clothing you currently have in your wardrobe? And which style of boot, if any, would that work with? Gents, knowing the answer to those questions is where you have to start because the thing I don't want you to do is to buy a pair of shoes that you will never wear. Mew, meew, meew, meew, meew. Now, what you want to do is find a pair that you love and then wear the heck out of them. Seriously, this pair right here I've probably had for five years and I have worn these probably three to four hundred times. So, you know what you need, you know what you have. Let's now talk about the different styles of boots and who they suit. Now, first up, we've got the Chelsea. Now, this style of boots been around coming in on 200 years, originally designed as a riding boot for Queen Victoria, but within a hundred years it was picked up by the mods, eventually the Beatles and it became the boot of rock stars. Nowadays, you can find it in a variety of styles, a variety of builds, and that's why this boot is so popular, its versatility. A black Chelsea with a leather sole that has a dress shoe-like design can actually be worn with a suit. On the other hand, a brown leather Chelsea with lug-thick soles like this is made to be worn with jeans. And then, there are Chelsea's that fall in between. This one, a gray suede material, so it's going to be very easy to match, but the sole right here is actually a leather sole with rubber studs for traction. Now, to understand how formalities change with shoes, check out this chart. As you can see here, darker colors in general are going to be more formal and smoother materials in general are going to be more formal. Texture materials like suede are going to be casual. And as mentioned earlier, you've got to look at the proportions, you've got to look at the build of things like the sole. Heavier thicker soles will give you more traction, but they are in general going to be more casual. Leather soles, on the other hand, give you a sleeker look and in general give you a dressier shoe. And if it wasn't obvious what man can wear Chelsea's, any man including any woman can wear a pair of Chelsea. You just need to find the right style for your particular needs. Next up, we've got the Chaka, aka the ankle boot also called the Desert Boot. Now, in case you don't know the history of the Chaka boot, this was made popular during World War II. It came out of Cairo. We have British officers out that way that wanted a very lightweight boot for the desert heat and that's exactly what they got. This pair right here is unlined. It's made from a suede material. And the key features of a Chaka is it only goes up to the ankles. We'll have two maybe sometimes three eyelets. It also leverages an open lacing system where the back of the shoe, the quarter, goes over the front of the shoe, the vamp. Now, the actual design of this shoe goes back about a hundred years because it is a very simple design that a number of cobblers around the world were using. But, post World War II in the 1950s and 1960s, this style picked up. It was made popular as a casual shoe for guys out on the east coast that had a bit of money. And perhaps it's that association with the Ivy League community and Preppy style that allow this relatively casual boot to actually be worn with clothing a lot of Americans with considered to be dressed up. We're talking chinos, button downs, polos. So, this isn't really a shoe you would ever wear with a suit. Now, it's definitely a casual style piece of footwear, but one that's well-loved. So, who would I recommend wear a pair of shoes like this if you're into Ivy League style? If you want to be able to dress up, go with the style that most men don't have, then this would be a great boot to add to your collection. But, I wouldn't recommend it as a first boot especially in a suede or color like this. Maybe this could be your first pair if you went with a material like this, but I think there are better options out there. Hi, gents. Today's video is sponsored by Thursday Boots. Gents, for years, I've been talking about Thursday because I love what these guys do. Great-looking boots that are quality made at a fair price. And, gents, if you like what you're seeing in today's video, when you get over to their website, you are going to be in love. They've got pretty much every style of boot that you have been looking for, all in a quality product that is incredibly comfortable on your feet. And, for some reason, if boots aren't your thing, which why are you watching this video? But, seriously, guys, they've got tons of great sneakers. Check out this versatile pair of sneakers they just came out with the court. And, as you can see here, it comes in a wide variety of colors. Or if you're looking for dress shoes, check out their loafers. I wear these all the time when I'm traveling. I've also got a pair of their double monks, but my favorites have to be the brogues. Similar to their boots, they just look really good. And, I'm just the sucker for the brogue leatherwork. I just think it always makes a pair of shoes look more elegant. So, gents, when it comes to footwear, when it comes to finding the perfect pair of boots, shoes, whatever type of footwear you're looking for, get over to Thursday Boots. Again, quality, great-looking styles all at a fair price. Guys, use the link in the description of today's video. Go check out Thursday Boots. I've talked about this company for years because I love what they do. Gents, I've been to their headquarters, I've talked to the owners. As you can tell, I've got a lot of pairs. I wear them personally. Guys, I love Thursday Boots and if you don't believe me, look at all their reviews. They've got thousands and thousands and thousands of men raving about this company because they are the real deal. So, if you're looking to level up your footwear, grab a pair of boots or shoes, guys, use that link in the description of today's video. Go check out Thursday Boots awesome company. Now, the next boot we've got on this list is the dress boot. Now, this particular pair has broguing, but you will find a number of dress boots out there that are going to be more plain. The broguing actually makes the boot a little bit more casual, but still, I'd wear this with a pair of dark jeans and a sports jacket. And this other pair because of the darker color, I think I could pull off with a casual suit. In any case, dress boots as the name implies are made to be worn with dressier clothing. Now, dress boots are lace boots, but they are different from the more casual laced style. And one of the first things you may notice is that leather used on a dress boot is made to take a shine. It's going to have a little bit more work down on the top. Oftentimes, it's going to be lighter, more supple. The result is it takes a polish better. Another small detail that indicates boots or not dress boots is look at the laces. Now, the lace boots on the dress boots, you can tell they're going to be rounded and they are going to be thinner. For the most part, but not always, dress boots will have a leather sole. And really this boot best serves a man that gets dressed up and would be wearing this to work. So, if that's not you, this is probably not the first pair of boots that you want to buy. So, what would be the first pair of boots that a man should buy? Well, definitely for most men not a western boot. And, yes, I love western boots that grew up in West Texas. And I think a roper for a lot of guys would be a great boot. Notice the shaft size difference, the roper also have a shorter heel. This is more of a work boot. While the classic cowboy style is going to have that higher shaft and a higher heel, this is more for dancing or for riding in a horse. And, yes, I do know how to two-step. But, seriously, western boots are great, but for most men this is not going to be the first pair of boots they want to buy unless you live in Houston and you can wear this to work every day, then go for it. Now, what about the mock toe? Well, I think a lot of guys can make a good case for this being their first pair of boots. Now, this is going to be ultra casual, very similar to the western. Westerns in general except for that black pair I just showed you. Yeah, even that black pair would be very difficult to wear with a suit. Again, if you're down in Texas, you can do it. But, this style right here is going to be casual. A lot of guys wear these as work boots. They find pairs that maybe have still toes in them. I think that these are a great style, but they are definitely casual. You would never wear this with formal or dress clothing. So, then, why do I like this boots so much? Why do I think this could possibly be a candidate for the first pair of boots a man buys if he likes the style because of the size of the toe box? So, mock toe boots are going to be some of the most comfortable boots you are going to find out there. In addition, this style right here, notice that how it has a flat bottom. This is going to give you good traction and for a lot of guys it's just going to be more comfortable for than any type of boot that has a heel. So, if you're a student, if you're an engineer, if you work in a casual field and you just want a pair of boots that you can wear in and out when you're moving around town, then, yeah, moccasins may be your thing, but I still think there's a better pair we're going to get to it. Is that better pair of the Lager or a pair of lug soles? Depends on the guy. When it comes to work boots, it comes to loggers, it comes to lug soles, you're going to find a lot of shoes in this category are going to fit those definitions. So, a lug sole is going to be a thicker, heavier sole made from one piece that's designed to give a man traction. Lager boots, work boots, any type of boot that's going for durability is going to be made from a thicker, heavier leather in the upper and a lot of times we're going to see a full grain in these type of boots. Now, the advantage of boots like this is they're practically indestructible. They're made for the most weather resistant part of the leather, so they're going to be able to be waterproofed and even if you beat them up, they're going to last a decade. You take care of these, these will outlive you. In fact, the only drawback to a lot of these heavier duty boots is that they can take weeks to actually break in especially the upper areas. So, should this be your first pair? Well, if you spend your time on your feet, if you are working then, yeah, get a pair of work boots, get a pair of loggers. Grab something with a lug sole that's good you're well-tuned that's stitched in. The only problem with this style is it's casual especially when you go with a contrasting sole and you look on here you've got that contrasting stitching. All of this makes it a more casual boot. But, if you work with your hands, if you want to get a boot that actually is going to be able to last, then you want to look for something that in the upper area has a full grain. Now, some of you guys are seeing Antonio, man, I want boots that look good. They make me a little bit taller. They make me feel like a rock star. In that case, look to the harness boot or look to the Jodiper. Either one of these are going to give you the rock star look and, yes, they're going to add probably about an inch and a half in some cases, two inches to your height because they have higher heels. And, by the way, both of these styles have a riding background, have a history, so that's why they have the higher heel. But, nowadays, these are more fashion, more style boots. And for a lot of guys, they are pushing the envelope. They're not used to wearing something that maybe has a little bit of flash with it, but I think if you've got the confidence and you want a pair of boots, it's going to stand out. A pair of boots is maybe going to grab a little bit of attention. Look at the harness, it's got that little bit of flash right there. But, if you want something with stouts a little bit more muted, check out this Jodiper right here in the straight dark brown leather. Or if you want a little bit more flash, maybe change the material by going with a dark green suede. So, what about hiking boots? What about combat boots? Now, neither one of these, but I recommend it's the first boot, a guy grabs. Both of these are specialty boots. The hiking boot designed to be able to give you traction, keep your feet warm. And with the speed lacing system, it made easy to be able to put on and off the feet with a pair of gloves. Now, combat boots have a lot of the same features you need to be able to march in them. They're going to give you support, they're going to keep your feet warm. But, also what's interesting about them is that they've got that higher shaft. And part of that is right here, we see it's a version of a combat boot, more of a jump boot, and it's designed to protect the ankles whenever people are jumping out of an airplane. As anyone that has gone through jump school knows, you're going to get that government-issued parachute, which is going to have you coming down at the ground very quickly. Yes, you're supposed to do the five-point touch, but the reality is if you land wrong, you are going to break your ankle. And the idea here is to better protect the ankle so that, yeah, you don't damage that government property. But, no, this pair right here, obviously Thursday boots more civilian design. The higher shaft, yes, is going to give you support, but I think for a lot of guys, they just simply like the look. It just has this more rugged, manly masculine feel, but probably not the first pair I'm going to recommend. And, of course, let's not forget engineer boots or motorcycle boots. This particular pair actually is a motorcycle style and I know that because it's got cushioning built in around the ankle. The idea, you know, if you go for a spill, if your bike falls over and your foot is underneath it, not that that would ever happen to you when you're stopping to stop sign, you forget to put your feet down. Yeah, it happens to the best of us. But, seriously, motorcycle boots on the inside as well are often going to have a zipper. That way, you're not having to deal with laces. You can just simply zip it down and take the boot off, solid traction on the soles. And this could very well be your first boot if you ride a motorcycle and don't have any other boots, then, yeah, I would recommend you get a pair of moto boots. But, seriously, gents, my favorite boot, the one that I would recommend if you're starting with your first pair, just go with a classic lace-up boot that, yes, is going to be casual. It's made more to be worn with jeans or a casual pair of trousers. But, this style right here, whether you go with a cap toe or whether you go with the plain toe is classic. In my advice, if you wear brown shoes, go with the dark brown, it's going to be the most versatile. Or if you wear black shoes, then simply go with a black boot because it's already going to work with all the other items in your wardrobe. Having recommended boots to hundreds of men over the years, I find that this style right here is the one you are going to get the most miles out of. So, what video to watch next? Well, gents, I got you covered how to match your boots with jeans. Pretty simple. I mean, you think it's easy, but, guys, mess this up, guys. I got you covered, boom, right here. Go check it out, solid video."

        "transcript": " There have been some amazing fragrances released in just the last year. However, the first three I'm going to highlight here, unless you want to waste your money, I think you should avoid them, which is really unfortunate because they come from brands that, well, I expect it a bit more. So, what are the fragrances I'm talking about? Dura-Savage Ophord. If you haven't seen this fragrance, they mixed it with water, not alcohol. They've got a proprietary system for doing this because naturally oil should not mix with water. The result is a milky looking liquid that unfortunately pulls together on the skin and easily forms droplets which leave a sticky residue on the skin. Now, the fragrance itself is a musky aromatic lavender with a powdery feel. Now, the scent itself isn't bad, but expectations were not met. And, for that reason, I got to throw this into my dust collector category. Another fragrance from a very popular house, I'm going to pan Aqua Dijou's Profondo Parfum. Now, the issue here is expectations. I have all the Aqua Dijou's. I have all the Profondo's Profondo lights and the original Profondo, which are both beautiful fragrances that I personally love. So, when I saw the parfum, I'm thinking, man, this thing is going to be deeper. It's going to be richer. It's going to be heavier. It's going to have more longevity. Well, all of that, I guess, is debatable, but for me, this thing does not last as long. It doesn't have as much projection and it's not as deep as the original. Now, I do find it sweeter and the marine notes are a bit more pronounced, but I'm just thinking, guys, keep it simple. When something says parfum, just strengthen the juice, make it stronger, give me what I expect. Yeah, for me, another fragrance is going to collect dust. I am throwing this in my lowest category. Now, this next fragrance is making a heck of a lot of money for Polo and that is their new established 67. It's a very simple aromatic citrus wood that's incredibly likable and I'm thinking if you're looking to get a gift for a teenager, this would be a great fragrance to give them. However, there is no creativity here because it's a straight up copy of Yves Saint Laurent's myself, Oda Parfum. Now, that fragrance has become one of the best sellers in the last couple of years and I see why Polo is a business decision would do this, but for me, this is going to be a dust collector because I already have the original that this is cloned off. Now, speaking of Yves Saint Laurent, what about the new Les Parfums? Now, if you don't own the EDP, you're a man in your 30s, 40s, or 50s and you like the DNA, you want something, yeah, that Polo sounds for teenagers, then this one is going to be the one you want to grab. The Les Parfums is a darker sexier, more sophisticated version of the original. Is it unique? No. Does it smell great? Yes. But, since there were so many other great releases, I can't give this one too much love, so I'm going to throw this into the good but forgettable category. Now, this next fragrance was a little bit harder for me to categorize. I know a lot of people, again, because of expectations have panned this fragrance. The fragrance I'm talking about is Chanel's new release Super Ledgera, which basically means super light. I personally have been holding out for the blue to Chanel Elixir, but they surprised us with this release in the online. And, really, this one takes me back to one of the first Chanel fragrances I ever purchased, Elore Aum Clone. Now, again, like a lot of you guys, I wanted something else. But, you know what? For what this fragrance is, it's good. It was hot outside, I wore it for an entire week. This was a solid wingman. So, for that reason, I got to throw this into that category. Now, at this point, you may be asking, come on, Antonio, give me a fragrance that you do like, one that exceeded expectations. Well, I've actually got a few that fit that definition. So, first up, we've got Zara's, the most wanted intense. Acetris Lavender Massey fragrance with a bit of spice. This was one of those hidden gem releases that most people aren't talking about that me personally I think is amazing. And, yes, I know some people have compared it to Eve's similar ones myself, but you can definitely tell the difference. This one is more masculine, it's got cajonis. And so, for that reason, I'm throwing this into the divine essence category. Next up, we've got the new Invictus Parfum, an aromatic musky marine with a bit of soap. In general, I've stayed away from the Invictus lime because I felt it was too synthetic. Somehow, with this one, they blended it better and it just comes off beautifully. In fact, this is going to be a complement monster. If you're looking for a warm weather fragrance, it's going to turn heads, this is the one. So, yeah, this one is going right into the divine essence. Now, one of the reasons I thought this last year was amazing for new releases is there were so many good citrus fragrances. So, this is Parfum de Marles Perseus. It's a citrus woody aromatic with a very prominent, very strong grapefruit. Now, there's a lot of other notes listed and after a couple hours, you do get past the strong citrus and you get down to the nice woody base. And I have to admit it's that citrus, it's that opening that I absolutely love. And if it didn't remind me so much of Dolce and Gabonis forever, I probably would have ranked it higher. But, yeah, I'm going to put this one right in the middle and I'm going to say it's a solid wingman. Now, this next fragrance is going into my highest level category. I'm not going to put a whole lot of fragrances in there. And after I admit this one barely made it in, but I've just been loving it. The name is spot on and it's just got a fresh clean opening that I love to smell again and again the fragrance I'm talking about Versace Arros Energy. Now, the notes here are interesting. You notice all the different citruses across the top. I definitely get the lemon, bergamot, even a bit of the orange. But, I have to say what Noxus went into the next category is that bit of pepper and the nice soft musk at the base which is there and I have gotten compliments two days after wearing this fragrance. And, as a guy with over 600 fragrances in his collection, the fact that I wore this for like three to four days straight, well, that says something. So, yeah, Versace Arros Energy going to God Tier. Now, if you're watching this and thinking, Antony, come on, you got all these designer fragrances, how about something niche? All right, let's pull in Mespecese's A Wonderful Flight. This is a beautiful citrus. It's going to be a little bit more complex than Arros Energy. It has a beautiful top, but it also has an earthier base that you can pick up within the first hour of wearing it. And, like all Mespecese fragrances, it comes in this really cool container that basically looks like a book and then it opens up and boom, you got the fragrance right there. And perhaps my favorite from that house, flirting with vanilla. Now, gents, if you're looking to buy fragrances online, you want to make sure you get the real deal. If you're looking for niche hard to find fragrances, then you want to get over to Maxaroma. Fragrances like Em McLeath, I've talked about the original, Desire Toxic, this is the new Desire Toxic Intense. It's an aromatic warm spicy green citrus fragrance that's very unique. And some of you guys know, I don't normally like a cannabis note, this thing is blended beautifully. Also in that house, Red Colorado and Gin Tonic, both of those absolutely beautiful. And the best thing about Maxaroma is you can get samples before you buy a full-on bottle. And, again, Maxaroma carries fragrances from niche houses from around the world. So, this fragrance right here, Wanderlust from Oman Luxury. Gents, this green fruity fragrance is unique. And if you're tired of smelling like everyone else, you want something that's really unique and you want something fresh, crispy, and green, I advise you check this one out. And the fragrance I'm wearing today, Copper Incense, except in French, by Ojar Fragmentses. Gents, look at the note profile. Designer fragrances aren't going to put out anything like this. With the weather cooling down here, I was drawn to this fragrance with that frankincense with that Brazilian rosewood, absolutely beautiful. So, gents, check out the link in the description of today's video. Go over and check out Maxaroma. Now, if you haven't picked up on it, a ranking like this is incredibly subjective. Seriously, some of the fragrances I call dust collectors could be ones that you absolutely love. And there's nothing wrong with that. Let's take Paco Rabon's Phansom Intense. This one was a letdown for me. So, I'm going to put it as a dust collector. I thought the first one when it came out was groundbreaking. The second one was better mixed, but this one it seems like it reverted. It seemed like they took away what made the other one so original and they went to something that was, yes, this will get you compliments. Yes, this one smells nice. The other ones were so much cooler. Another dust collector for me is going to be the H24 Herbez Vives. Now, I really wanted to like this and did I pronounce? Yeah, I don't even bother pronouncing this thing correctly because let's face it, I'm just never going to wear this fragrances. I love the original H24. I would put that at God mode, but this one right here, I got to put as a dust collector because they took the moss in the EDP and they just amplified it. It's more earthy. And again, some guys are going to love this fragrance for me. Yeah, it's just not something I'm going to ever put on. And again, expectations are so important. This next fragrance came from one of my favorite houses. I've always got high expectations for the house of Tom Ford. However, this one right here I felt was the weakest in the ombre leather line. That is going to be Ode Ombre. Now, the original was a bit harsh. The parfum absolutely beautiful. This one, I mean, it's good, but it seems to be missing the DNA of the original and it just doesn't have the same oomph to it. So it's good, but forgettable. Now, this next fragrance I know was released a while back, but I want to bring it in anyway because I didn't have anything else from Coach and it's one of the newest releases, Green. I really like this one. This is a solid winged man. I got it right in the middle. And you don't see too many green fragrances that have the Kiwi note. It's fruity, it's attractive, this is going to get you compliments. It is a green fragrance that a lot of men would just love to wear and I think should. The same thing with Mont Blanc's Legend Blue. This one just came out and the red was pretty forgettable. This one, you know, legend is very easy to wear fragrances and Mont Blanc ain't doing anything new, so the expectations were relatively low, but this thing slightly exceeded expectations. It's fresh, it's pleasant, it's going to get you compliment, it punches above its weight. For that reason, I'll put this one as a solid wing man. Now, the next fragrance I'm going to talk about is the third in its line and it is the best. This one here originally came out a couple years ago. I thought it was renamed. I talked about that whole story. When the EDP came out, it was a big improvement. But this new one, the Intents, I'd have to say is the best. So, Dolce & Gabbana's K, Oda Parfum Intents. When you look at the Accordes, relatively simple. You've got that sweetness in there with the saffron and the fig and the leather in the woods give it a bit of masculinity. I do like this fragrance and I think it's a head turner. So, for that reason, I'm going to put this fragrance in at the second highest category, Divine Essence. So, now, let's talk about a couple more good but forgettable. So, first up, we got Yves Saint Laurent's Y Elixir. Now, if you like lavender, if you like wood, which most people do, this fragrance is perfectly fine. But, for an elixir and for what they're charging, guys, I just expected a bit more from this house. So, yeah, it's good, but easily forgettable when you look at the entire line, which the line is fine. It's a crowd of pleasing line, but, yeah, this one doesn't really do anything for me. Something could be said about rain essence from Bulgari. This I was just expecting so much. It's rain essence. You're expecting it to smell like rain or at least it's a little bit too earthy. I didn't get enough for the rain. In fact, I really didn't get any of the rain which is disappointing because I love how it smells after a good rain here in the Midwest and this wasn't even close. And so, for that reason, yeah, I mean it's not a dust collector to unique fragrance, but, yeah, this is it's good, but easily forgettable. And speaking of dust collectors, let's go ahead and throw one million gold under the bus. Again, there's a lot of other fragrances in this line. And I think if you never smell to one million fragrance, this is probably not the one you want to smell because it's a pretty much copy of Santel 33. But, yeah, it just it didn't smell like a one million, a Pocca ribbon. I expected more of the longevity is not that great. Yeah, skip this one. Now, this next fragrance is going to probably surprise some of you guys, but, hey, it's a personal preference. I love coconut. I love tropical islands and this fragrance right here is just so beautiful, so wearable and the more that I wear it, the more I love it. I'm talking about Jean Paul Gatt\u00e9's Le Beau Paradise Garden. I feel with a couple of sprays, you could wear this into the office in the winter when you're thinking about escaping to a tropical island. It's just nice. And, yes, it barely gets into Gatt\u00e9. I probably could have put it at Divine Essence, but I got a lot of other ones. I'm going to put it Divine Essence. So, yeah, I decided to give this one a little bit of a boost and, again, it's a great fragrance. It's unique. If you don't have a fragrance like this in your collection, look at it. Next up, we've got a fragrance from Carolina Herrera and that is going to be Bad Boy Cobalt Elixir. An earthy fresh spicy vanilla with a bit of wood. This is a really nice fragrance. And I really wrestled with putting into a solid wingman, but because of that unique truffle note and I really do like the smell of this one, I believe it's an improvement, I'm going to go ahead and knock this one up to Divine Essence. It's a solid pick up, one of the best. It's the better of the cobalts. And, straight up, it's fragrances like this that really deserve, I think, to be more in the solid wingman category. So, the entire hero collection, I think, is above expectations. When I first saw this in Burberry in general, I wasn't expecting much, but every single fragrance they've put out are solid picks. Now, nothing about the hero collection is groundbreaking or unique, but that's why I really like these. These would make great gifts. And like you would think, the EDT is going to be the lightest, the EDP a bit stronger. And this parfum follows the tradition. It is the darkest, it is the richest. It's going to have the longest longevity. And even though I haven't gotten compliments with this one, I've read the reviews, I've seen what other people are saying. A lot of people are just getting compliments with this thing, so give it a shot. Especially, I love the fact that you can walk into usually any box store and you can find this one. Yeah, Burberry did a good job with this one. Now, this next fragrance is definitely a divine essence. But I was still a little bit disappointed with it because I feel the house was holding back on us. I know they're probably going to come out with another variation of it which will be stronger which they have done with everything. But we're talking about Victor and Rolf spy spawn and this is their dark leather. Now, despite the fact that for a spy spawn, this doesn't have much longevity, which for that is like six hours. And it doesn't project as much. I'm still going to put this as a divine scent because Victor and Rolf kicks butt when it comes to unique fragrances that basically grab people's attention when you walk into a room. And the peppers there, the cinnamon's there, the black leather with the tobacco, yeah, you can pick that up. It's just my only reservation with this is, man, they should have made it stronger. I guess I can over spray and just, you know, wear more of it. But, yeah, this one is nice. Now, this next one that's going to be in God tier is coming from a Spanish house. I don't talk about them too often, but I'm going to give them a little bit of props and that is going to be Loewe and we're talking about Ascencia elixir. So, straight up, if you have smelled Creed Absolute Aventus, this is a clone of that fragrance. So, even though I'm putting this at God tier, I do got to say, you know, I understand what they're doing here, but, hey, I love the fact that they can bring that very expensive fragrance to the masses with a fragrance that's absolutely beautiful. It's got good longevity, decent projection. In fact, it projects, I think, better than the original Aventus Absolute. In fact, some people have said that this is what Absolute wanted to be when it grew up. Other people say it's a horrible chemical mess. Again, I find for the price, you can take a chance on this and I'm very happy with it. But, let me know if you agree, disagree in the comments below. But, yeah, this is sneaking into God tier. Now, this next fragrance is a dust collector. It's brand new, but I just wasn't impressed and that's going to be Valentino Umo's Born in Roma Gold. So, I've got a lot, pretty much all the fragrances from this house and I have to say that this was just redundant. Yes, it's sweet, it's got a vanilla note to it, which a lot of people are going to like it. And if you don't own any of the Valentino Umo fragrances, you may actually pick this up and say, hey, this is great, which is why I want to emphasize that when I talk about all these fragrances and I ring something low, it doesn't mean you won't like it. It just simply means that for me, I just wasn't impressed. It wasn't something and, yeah, it's something I'd skip. And this is one. Now, again, there's another one in this house I'm going to talk about here in a few minutes, which was frigging amazing and blew me away. But this one, yeah, I would skip. So, this next fragrance I'm going to put in the good but forgettable category and if some of you guys are going to smell it and you're like, Antonio, are you stupid? Yes, you probably have, you're probably smarter than me and you probably have a better nose. But for me, I really did like the original scandal with the Carmel note and the, you know, the parfum was really nice as well. This one, the absolute just it was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was forgettable. It just reminded me of a lot of other fragrances I have. It's woody, fruity, warm, spicy, and I really wanted to pick up that unique Mirabelle note, but I just didn't get it. And by the way, if you've watched this far on your thing and Antonio, what do you do with all these extra fragrances that you have? Because I am giving away my fragrance collection. Well, guys, that's over at the Brotherhood of Scent. I'll put a link in the description. Those are amazing community of frag heads that we have over on the school platform, so go check it out. Not only am I giving away my fragrance collection, but we've got free courses and shoot the shit with other frag heads. People share where they get their best deals. Yeah, it's a solid community and usually I'm giving away a fragrance a week and they're absolutely free. So, the two fragrances I would put in that wingman category, Giovinci Gentleman Society Extreme and Prada's Luna Rosa Ocean Le Parfum. Now, the Society EDP Extreme, the accords here are going to be woods with a bit of powder, aromatic coffee and a touch of vanilla. Mostly, what I get is nutmeg and vanilla. It does remind me of the original society which actually was a very good fragrance. Sweet comforting with a reminder even of Dior home. This one, yeah, is a solid wingman. Now, with the Prada Ocean Le Parfum, we get the accords of woods, amber, warm spice with a bit of citrus. It's a very versatile, deep rich sweet fragrance. Notice the saffron note there. Again, the issue they've got here with this fragrance is they misnamed it. I don't know why it has the ocean name in it. All that being said, I do like the fact that this one is different than the other flankers in the line. It probably should have been called elixir. It's, yeah, a really nice fragrance and, again, a solid wingman. So, jumping over to divine essence, let's go ahead and bring up right here. We've got this Gucci Guilty Elixir De Parfum. We've got vanilla with a bit of floral, warm spicy amber powder, iris. Understand that this is a floral fragrance. Not every guy is going to go for it. I do recommend that you smell it first, wear it before you go out there and buy a full bottle. But it's a Gucci fragrance. It's well blended. It's a solid pickup if you're into this type of fragrance. And I do think it is a beautiful fragrance. So, yeah, for that reason, it's going to divine essence. Now, this next fragrance is a god tier, by the way, was one of the more surprising fragrances that I didn't expect to like. The notes are pretty simple as you can see here. Overall, a relatively simple fragrance, but that combination I thought was absolutely beautiful. It surprised me coming out of the line. It did because in general, I find most of their fragrances uninspiring, but, yeah, I got to give props where props are due. And the fragrance I'm talking about is Valentino Umos Born in Roma Green Stravaganza. Masculine fun, green creamy and I love that mix of the citrus with the coffee. It shouldn't go together, but in this case, it does. In fact, the only issue I have with this fragrance is the longevity could be a bit longer, maybe could project more, but just spray a bit more on. It is a really unique nice fragrance. And for that reason, I'm putting this one at the top god tier. All right, gents. So, what video to watch next? Come on. You know I got you covered. Another fragrance video. Yeah, come on. Dive into it. Boom. Right there. Check it out. Oh, yeah. How to smell good? How to keep smelling good all day? Come on. I got you covered."

        "transcript": " So, look at the fashion trends right now. Apparently, plaid trousers, leather cross-body bags, and bright colored puffer jackets are in demand are what people that are in the know are going to be wearing. But, here is what it could look like if you try to pull it off altogether. But, seriously, gents, I don't have anything against fashion because if you've got the confidence and body type to pull these things off, well, you probably can. Although, there's no guarantee the proof being this picture of Lenny Kravitz, a few seasons back trying to pull off the oversized scarf look. Yes, that fashion trend is back and if you're shorter than seven feet tall, I'd be careful trying to pull that one off. Now, if you've watched any of my videos of last few years, you might assume that I don't like fashion. But, the truth is a bit more nuanced because although I do think fashion can be an expensive trap where a man buys an item and it's out of style within a season, there is at least one big benefit for those of us in the classic fashion that comes with fashion trends. And that's being able to find and purchase classic pieces that happen to be in fashion that are not normally manufactured in mass. The result is you end up being able to get a turtleneck cashmere sweater or a double-breasted suit jacket in your size on sale at your local department store. Example, this year we're starting to see a lot more vintage inspired leather jackets. These are both motorcycle style jackets and flight style jackets. On top of that, we're seeing the trend of Sherpa lining. And, for that Sherpa lining trend, we're seeing this both in leather jackets and trucker style jackets. Now, both of these fashion trends are lined with timeless items. So, if you've been on the hunt for a Sherpa style flight jacket, maybe one inspired by Masters of the Air, well, this is probably going to be the season to find that perfect jacket you've been looking for. So, now, let's jump over to knitwear. There are going to be three types of sweaters in fashion this season. Now, this first one I would avoid and that's going to be bold embroidered sweaters. Now, if you find one that's really subtle, you can like it, you can afford it, then go for it. But, in general, the trend here is to be bold. And, although this look for some men can look good, this isn't going to be a versatile piece. It's probably not going to layer well because it demands attention and they're memorable. So, you're going to want to wear this next season? Well, probably not. Now, instead, look at a classic shaker rib knit sweater. Now, the shaker stitch is a very particular type of stitch in knitwear that is almost identical to the same type of stitch in fishing and errand sweaters. Basically, it uses a thicker yarn, it's got a rougher look to it. Really, you're just adding a casual sweater to your wardrobe that's functional, that's going to keep you warm. And, in five years, you'll still be able to wear. And that third sweater in fashion, the statement turtleneck. Now, this one's a mixed bag. I would avoid patterns on my turtleneck. But, solid colors even if they're a bit bold, even if they're a bit strong, I find that if it fits you well layered under a sports jacket, this can be a really sophisticated look, one I personally love. And, again, the fact that these are in fashion, you should have a little bit more selection, a few more colors to choose from. And, don't be afraid to pull a trigger on this timeless style. Now, some of you guys probably noticed that I'm wearing a knit polo right here, but notice how my collar is strong, it doesn't fall under the jacket? Well, the reason for that is today's sponsor, Slick Collar. So, many of us own collared shirts that have a wheat collar that whenever we layer them with a sweater, with a sports jacket, with a suit, they fall down, they flap over. They make you look like you don't pay attention to the details. So, instead of you having to go out and buy a whole bunch of new shirts, you buy the Slick Collar and you slip it right under your existing collar in, voila. You've got a great looking collar that stands up, that holds its form and looks good. Now, gents, when you order a Slick Collar set, it comes with three Slick Collars, the Slick Collar, regular size, your go-to for flawless collars on all your favorite shirts. The Slick Collar, Slim Size, Perfect for Polos, and those Slim Fit Dress shirts. The new Slick Collar Athletic Size designed specifically for larger necks and wider collars. It also comes with ten collar stays, so you can make sure your collar points are on point, but simply put, gents, when you've got a wheat collar like I have right here with this great knit shirt, the reality is a knit shirt is never going to have a strong collar. So, with the Slick Collar, I'm able to get the look that I want whenever I layer this piece in knitwear with a jacket. And, gents, this may seem like such a small thing, but your collar frames your face. You don't want a floppy collar falling all over the place and really detracting from a look that you put a lot of effort into. So, again, gents, it doesn't matter what type of shirt. If it's a dress shirt, if it's a polo, if it's a knitwear collared shirt, any shirt that has a collar, Slick Collar is going to help that shirt look better because of the various sizes it will fit any size collar. And the best part for you, gents, they're incredibly affordable. Seriously, use that link in the description of today's video. You're going to get the best deal on the web. Guys, this is a no-brainer if you want to level up your existing wardrobe. Now, speaking of shoes, the big thing this year is going to be lugged soles. These are heavier, thicker soles that from a functional aspect add a lot to a pair of shoes. They make them more weather resistant and physically they lift you up a bit. We're in these type of soles make you look taller. They're down side with the wrong combination, it can make the shoe look a little bit awkward. And that's why I've got reservations for this new trend of leather derbies with lugged soles. Now, derbies as you know are not technically a formal shoe. They're going to be, you know, not the level of oxfords, but still in most people's minds when they look at this type of shoe especially in black, they think dress boots are a little bit too much. So, to match it with this heavier sole, this heavier bottom, it can look odd. So, be careful jumping onto this trend. Now, with Chelsea boots, we're seeing the same thing. But it seems from the examples that I've checked out when the manufacturer does go with that lugged sole on the Chelsea, he's building up the toe box, he's overall designing a boot that's a little bit larger on top and isn't going to be mistaken for a dress boot. So, a chunky pair of Chelsea's, would I go for that? Probably quicker than I would for the derbies. But, in both cases, be careful. You want to go with a timeless design especially when you're spending good money on footwear. So, really quick, let's talk color. Brown and earth tones are in this season. In addition, we're going to see some darker richer colors, reds, and burgundies. Now, I just so happen to love these colors. So, for me, this is a great season. But, here's the thing, if you have never liked the color brown in any of its variations or burgundy red just doesn't work for your skin tone, if that's you, don't fall into the trap of trying to make this work. Because for me, I may be able to find some deals, I may find a turtleneck sweater in burgundy that, yeah, actually I already have one. But, hey, I could use a backup. Point being is I would wear that item whether or not it's in fashion at all. You, on the other hand, maybe gravitate more towards a gray, a black, or lavender. Whatever it is, don't try to force a color down. If you've never liked brown, but you're seeing all these great deals, you're seeing people get into it, don't try to jump this season's bandwagon because it'll be gone like a flash in the pan. And then, you'll be stuck with an item that even if you sell it, you'll be getting pennies on the dollar. Now, earlier we talked about puffer jackets in bright colors. For me, in general, my complexion doesn't work with brighter colors. Again, if you've got something and you're like, hey, this bright color works with my darker skin, my darker tones, then go for it. But, speaking of puffer jackets, let's go over to puffer vests. These are going to be popular as well. I'm going to say for a lot of us, this is, you know, it's a borderline modern classic. I think if you find one that fits you well, it really can fill a hole in the wardrobe. When worn with the right piece of knitwear or shirt underneath it gives a really nice layered look. And, again, because it's in fashion, we should have more selection of colors, more selection of styles, fits. If you can find something that works for you and you like to look, I'd say go for it. Now, with denim, we're seeing two things here. We're seeing denim formal wear and we're seeing double denim. Now, I've seen that denim formal wear interpreted in different ways and I do think that you can mix a little bit of denim. I saw this over a decade ago, people wearing denim trucker jackets, layering them with sports jackets, or wearing a lightweight denim shirt with a casual suit. Personally, not my cup of tea, but having been in this game long enough, I've seen it return. So, I do think this is something that give you a little bit more fashion for you probably can pull it off. Now, with the denim and denim look, the Canadian Tuxedo, this one it has been around for a long time. I still don't like to look especially when the denim is too closely matched. However, if there's a strong contrast, maybe a different weight of the denim, I think it can work. But, the good news here, again, because it's in fashion, you should have more selection. So, if you've been looking for a dark denim button down or maybe you want to find a good trucker jacket on sale, this could be the season for that. Next up, we've got wide brim hats. So, I'm not a man that daily wears a hat. If you're into hats, this could be a great season for you. Maybe you've always stuck with thinner brim hats. This may be a season to kind of push outside your comfort zone. But, in my experience, wider brim hats are a little bit harder to wear. So, unless you already wear a hat, I'd be really careful trying to jump onto this trend. Next up, we've got corduroy. This comes in and out since the 1970s. Actually, even going farther back. For some guys who reminds them of the childhood, maybe they had a pair of trousers like this. And I do think in trousers, in pants, this is where it's best utilized. If you currently don't own a pair, then I would say look at the color of the majority of your trousers and just go with that same color. Reason being, you know it's going to work with the majority of your shirts and it's the texture. It's the whales themselves which are going to separate this trouser from all the other ones in your wardrobe. But, if you find something in an earth tone which probably going to be the most popular colors out there, we're talking mustard, rust, olive, dark brown. And if you feel it's going to work with some of your button downs or your sweaters, then go ahead and give it a shot. Corduroy's have been around for a long time. They are a classic. Now, speaking of trousers, let's talk about the tactical aesthetic we're going to see out there. A lot of different types of cargo pants, but these aren't the cargo pants from the early 2000s that were super loose although a wider fit is becoming more prevalent. Now, most of these cargo pants are going to fit relatively well and the cargo pockets themselves aren't going to be oversized. I personally have mixed feelings on cargo pants. If you're going to use them, you're going out hiking. But then again, I'm 48. I do feel this is a little bit more of a youth style. Guys in their 30s, 40s, 50s, you can pull it off, but again, you really need to know what you're doing. And if you go for a bold pattern like camo, keep everything around it muted and let those trousers speak for themselves. Now, a couple other items I really like, wool beanies, windbreakers. Both of these, if you get a non-flashy color, avoid the patterns. Just go with a solid neutral. You'll be able to use year in, year out. You'll be good to go. And with that being said, gents, don't stop viewing. Come on, I got you covered with another video. Boom, right here. Oh, yeah. Come on. Yeah, click. Come on. Check it out right there. Oh, yeah. Come on. Boom."

        "transcript": " In a period of 50 years, how did suspenders go from being an essential part of every stylish man's wardrobe to now becoming an accessory that's so rare that most stores don't even carry them? In fact, nowadays belts outsell suspenders by a margin of 100 to 1. The answer to that question is actually right here in this photograph. Look close. Do you see it? And no worries if you didn't because here at the end of this video, you're going to be able to spot the detail I'm talking about. In fact, by the end of this video, gents, you may decide to go out there and get a pair of suspenders because as you probably know, there are so many benefits to wearing them when compared to a belt suspender wears square by the superior comfort of their a.k.a. braces. Now, the reason for this is suspenders distribute the weight across the shoulders versus with a belt you're cinching around the waist. Another advantage if you got a hard to fit body time, if you're a bit rounder around the midsection, you're going to find suspenders simply work better than a belt. And straight up a lot of guys just like the look. The freedom from the tightness around the waist for a lot of guys just gives a better fit. And I'm just going to give you a quick tip. I'm going to give you a quick tip. When you wear a belt, you can guys report that when they wear suspenders, they actually stand up straighter. Oh, and did I mention they're timeless and perfect for formal wear? Now, at this point, you may be asking the obvious question, if suspenders are so perfect, why did men stop wearing them? How in the world did the belt take over men's fashion? That, gentlemen, is the subject of today's video. So, to answer this question, I need to test your knowledge of fashion. Actually, it's more of a question I had as I started doing research for this video. And that is how did ancient man or even men in the 16th century keep their pants from falling down with their knees? Because belts as a tool to hold up pants have only been used for about a hundred years. And suspenders only a little bit longer just coming in on 300 years. So, what were guys doing going back 400 or even 4,000 years ago? Well, the earliest device that we have archaeological evidence that men used as far back as 5,000 years ago was the drawstring. Basically, a simple string made from an animal hide or a fabric, drawstrings provided a basic method of tightening the clothing around the waist. Now, in the medieval ages, we saw the rise of the girdle. Similar to about these were tied around the waist and they would secure a tunic robe or other garment. And depending on how much money you had and where you stood in society, you could decorate these with embroidery, pressure stones, or even a metal buckle. Now, in the 15th century, we saw the rise of the codpiece. See what I did there? But, seriously, besides highlighting the crotch, the codpiece actually did have a little bit of a functional role as it helped demands doublet his jacket connect to his trousers, the hose, and it helped everything stay in place. And in the 16th century, when breeches became more popular, we saw the rise of the sash. And although they did provide a functional aspect, most sashes at the time were decorative. Now, the point I want you to take from that history lesson is when it comes to holding up your pants, your decision of the tool you use is less of a choice as it is a matter of fashion. Which is an important point because it emphasizes our current love affair with belts isn't so much a conscious decision, but a fashion trend that we're currently in. Now, speaking of belts, today's video is sponsored by my favorite belt company, Anson Belt and Buckle. I've got proof right here that I have been a fan of Anson Belt and Buckle for over a decade. Check out this video. I made this back in 2011 way before they were a sponsor. Seriously, back then, I was impressed with them and today I'm still impressed because I know most men are wearing a belt that's obsolete. Seriously, with Anson Belt and Buckle, they leverage the micro-adjust system. This is a belt that has no holes and you can adjust to a quarter of an inch. And on top of that, you don't have the issue of the ugly stress mark. And let's face it, when it comes to your accessories, when it comes to a belt, you want it to look good, right? Well, with Anson Belt and Buckle, your belt is going to look amazing because you got tons of options when it comes to straps. To buckles, you've got them in a wide variety of different colors, different styles, different looks. And that takes me to another thing. What I found out about Anson Belt and Buckle is the interchangeability. Most people are going to see three belts here, three buckles, three straps. Now, what I see here, nine different combinations. When every strap goes with every buckle, you have nine different looks that you can wear. And that's why by far the best offer on their website is to grab a box set. When you get over there, you can choose two buckles, three straps, two straps, three buckles, or if you want three and three, they've got that option as well. And let's talk about their legendary customer service. Remember, one of you guys reached out to me and said, Antonio, I can't believe it. I cut that belt strap a little bit too short. And he reached out to Dave and said, hey, man, I need to get another strap. And Dave, the owner, he said, don't worry about it. I'll take care of you and sent him a replacement strap at no cost. And, gents, that's why I love Anson Belt and Buckle and I support them so feverishly because this is a U.S.-based business that treats their customers like gold. And, of course, gentlemen, to always get the best deal on the web, use the link I'm putting in the description of today's video. Make sure to sign up for their email list. Occasionally, they got flash sales up to 20% off on their email list and on their text club up to 30% off on occasion. Seriously, gents, an amazing company. I've known them now for over a decade and I've supported them and I love what they're doing. So, again, use that link in the description of today's video to get the best deal on the web. So, we traced the birth of suspenders back to 1736 when a French ribbon manufacturer began producing and selling decorative suspender straps. Now, these early iterations were connected to the trousers with buttonholes, which is a tradition that continues today. And over the next hundred years, the fashion in the industry of suspenders flourished. And as mentioned earlier, the reason for this was the simultaneous rise of breeches. These knee-length trousers became all the rage and as more men wore them, the need from keeping these breeches from falling down all of a sudden became evident. Now, early suspender materials really depended on how much money the person had to spend. A man that was working class perhaps would go with a cheaper cotton or a very simple durable leather. While a man of higher status, they had more means, could go with a beautiful pair made from silk or a combination of all three of those materials. But, the big innovation with suspenders came in 1822 when Albert Thurston brought the X and Y designs which we see on the back of the suspenders to the masses. At about this time as well, we saw the use of elastic materials which made suspenders not only more comfortable, but ensure they maintained a snug fit throughout the day. And by the mid-19th century, during the Victorian era, this was the height of suspender usage. Throughout Europe and North America, suspenders were seen as an essential men's accessory. That being said, it was one of those accessories that most people didn't even see on a man because it was considered underwear. It was one of those items that was worn under the jacket and men did not take off their jackets in public. Still, if a man had means, if he had money, he would oftentimes go with a decorative pair. For certain industrialists or aristocrats, it was one of those small details that sent the signal you had the money to spend on those little details that most people well just aren't going to spend the money on. Because at this point, everybody had a pair of suspenders. It didn't matter if you were a farmer, if you were a laborer, you owned a pair of suspenders because it was the only practical item in your wardrobe that would keep your pants up. But the dominant position that suspenders held in menswear was about to end. So, the belt as we know it has only been used to hold up men's trousers since really the 1920s. Prior to that and for thousands of years, belts were used as a utility item. For thousands of years, leather belts have been used to hold weapons, gear, and other items that could be strapped to them. Now, this may sound cumbersome to many, but when you're riding a horse and you need quick access to a weapon, a utility belt is incredibly functional and a great tool that in my time in the Marine Corps, I still saw used. But as an accessory to hold up clothing, it really didn't make sense especially in the 1890s, 1900s because most men were wearing their trousers at their natural waist point. And this is important to note. Notice that this is where your natural waist is, not down where most of us are wearing jeans nowadays. Well, lo and behold, in 1914, the world falls into World War I. For the next four years, all the resources of the major powers around the world are going into combat arms. And as the resources for making clothing is scarce, all of a sudden designers and manufacturers are trying to come up with new ways to be able to make garments so that they use less fabric. Well, one innovation that can save you about 10% when you're manufacturing a pair of trousers is to make the waist lower. Almost all shirts at the time were made long enough that they could make up this difference. And so, we started to see some military uniforms and civilian clothing made with a lower rise. Which the rise of the pair of trousers is the measurement from the waist point all the way down to the length of the crotch if the trousers were laid out flat. Now, post World War I, you got a lot of these soldiers coming back. They really liked their uniforms because they were more casual. They were actually more comfortable than a lot of the day-to-day formal wear that these guys have been wearing at home. And manufacturers started to oblige by producing more and more casual clothing to include this new style of trousers that had a lower cut. And strangely enough, these things called belt loops. And by the 1930s, the silver screen, the growing Hollywood industry with stars like Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, all of a sudden put men in front of millions of people who were wearing these lower cut trousers. The manufacturers had picked up on this. Belts were being produced in mass. And because they had less parts than suspenders and you saw a lot of demographic shift in the younger generations, wanted to separate themselves from the older more formal generations of yesteryear. By the late 1930s, we saw belt sales just about equal suspender sales. Well, from 1939 to 1945, again wartime period, so we saw the manufacturing of civilian clothing really cut back. This went back to being a functional item on a uniform. Suspenders were still used in many of the uniforms of World War II. But post-war in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, once the GIs returned home, we continued to see the rise of the belt and the fall of suspenders. Again, Hollywood is having a big effect. We see guys like Cary Grant, James Dean, all wearing belts. This is the new style. The only guys wearing suspenders, yeah, those are the guys that can't let go of old habits, the guys in their 50s, 60s, and 70s. In the 1960s and 70s, we see the counterculture movement, the hippies all of a sudden take on the belts musicians like the Beatles. Everyone's wearing belts and they're having fun with it. All types of casual styles, casual materials, it becomes a fashion item. And just as we think suspenders are going to die, guess what? The 1980s happened, Gordon Gekko, the whole Wall Street look, all of a sudden suspenders are back. Sales shoot up all of a sudden the idea of a man of power, of a man that's in charge. Are there any people that are wearing suspenders in a power suit? We see suspenders shoot up, but it's a false positive because by the 1990s, suspender sales again are in free fall. And that's where we're at today. Suspenders, you can find them in specialty stores, but they are a niche accessory that to be honest, if you were to go into a hundred men's wardrobes, you'd be lucky to find a couple that had a pair of suspenders. Now, getting back to that picture that I showed you earlier, can you spot now the detail that was the death knoll for suspenders? Let me show you another picture side by side. You see the difference? Yes, it is the position of the trousers, the waistline. That small detail right there, gentlemen, is the number one reason why suspenders fell off, why most men don't wear them today is simply the trousers that we buy are not designed to be worn with suspenders. In fact, I hinted at it when I was talking about 1920 how we started to see trousers made with belt loops. Well, good luck nowadays walking into a store and finding a pair of trousers that doesn't have belt loops on it. In fact, if you want pants that are designed to be worn with suspenders, they're going to have that higher waistline, you pretty much have to get them custom. Throw onto that the rise of casual fashion and the impact of influencers. Yeah, the social perception of suspenders despite them having tons of advantages is that their old fashion and even a guy like me that has an extensive wardrobe, I can tell you that the number of times I've worn suspenders, I can count on one hand. All right, gents. So, if you enjoyed this video, you are going to love this one. Yes, the whole why did men stop series? I've got a number of videos. I just find it really interesting. If you love history, if you love really understanding why we do what we do, you're going to, yeah, just check it out. Solid video, boom, right here. Oh, yeah."

        "transcript": " Pop quiz, gentlemen. What's the difference between an esthetician and an esthetician? As many of you guys probably know, an esthetician focuses in on cosmetic treatments that improve the appearance and health of the skin. Exfoliation, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, and facials. An esthetician with an A, on the other hand, usually works under a doctor in a medical clinic. They can usually do everything an esthetician does. They can also do a little bit more invasive work like laser treatments, microneedling, and both photo and medical grade facials. Anyone that's dealt with burns, scars, or cancer-related skin conditions especially on the face has probably worked with one of these professionals. But, here's the deal, gents. Any guy that wants to look his best can usually just walk in, set up an appointment, and see one of these professionals for a relatively inexpensive amount of money and can get professional guidance and help improving their face, their skin, their personal appearance. In fact, a good friend of mine is a local esthetician with an E. She says the clients that see the most improvement are these 35 to 55-year-old guys that work in blue color industries whose skin is exposed to dust, cement, sawdust, and they're out in the sun all day. Now, I get it. A lot of you guys when it comes to looking good, you're DIY guys, you are never going to go see a professional. So, what can you do at home to make sure your skin looks good? Well, first, never use bar soap on your face. You want to use an actual face wash. You see, a hand soap to have one purpose and that is to clean. And, although you want your face to be clean, the unintended side effect of this is it can lead the skin incredibly dry. Not a great look for the face. A face wash on the other hand is going to have a moisturizer in it and is going to maybe pull back a bit on the hard cleaning ingredients. The result, you get a clean face without the dryness. The next tip is to apply a moisturizer. First thing in the morning, preferably with a sunblock. And, if you can't find one that you like or apply them separately, but this combination is key to preventing age spots. Now, for men that spend a lot of time outside especially not protected from the sun, you can start to show age spots in your 30s. However, most men, me included, will start to show them by our mid 40s and into our 50s. Now, if you do want to minimize age spots, I do recommend speaking with an esthetician or dermatologist, but there are many over-the-counter topical treatments that contain ingredients like retinol, hydroquinone, and vitamin C. These treatments over time have been shown to reduce pigmentation. And, as mentioned earlier, if you're looking at micro abrasion or lasers, again, go see a professional. Now, this next mistake applies to you guys out there that have a beard or are growing a beard. Poor beard grooming. Now, when you're in your 20s not taking care of your beard, make sure look a little bit sloppy. In your 30s, 40s, 50s, it can make you look tired, old, and washed up. So, first up, you got to take care of the neckline especially if you're a taller guy, everyone is going to notice. Basic trimming, making sure you don't have loose hairs, that you have an overall even growth that looks sharp, that looks clean, that looks like you put some effort into it. And, by the way, I do know the mustache is back and even if you're growing it by itself, guys, you don't want it fully covering the lips. So, yes, your mustache, you want to maintain, keep it clean especially if you're starting to gray if you have a more mature look to you. Now, gents, if you're looking for a tool, it's going to be able to handle all your hair trimming needs. Gents, you need to check out today's sponsor, Brio, and their Beardscape V2. So, first up, it uses a ceramic blade that stays sharp for years. Next up, it's got a battery life of up to 240 minutes. And, by the way, I've had this trimmer for over a year and as you can see, it is still holding a charge no problem. Now, the key with a good pair of trimmers is to have a tool that can adjust to the length that you need. And that's what I love about the Beardscape, it adjusts at 0.3 millimeter increments. It's also got a really nice grip and a travel lock. So, when you're traveling, it's not going to accidentally turn on and run the battery dry. And on the inside, it's got the best motor in the industry capable of anywhere from 5K to 7K RPMs. The Beardscape can be used on any part of the body. And, of course, you can buy additional blades for that purpose that will easily change in and out. And if you're looking for a blade that cuts really close, check out their Zero blade. This works right with the V2 trimmer and it gets down to 0.2 millimeters and has a stainless steel blade perfect for those super close cuts. And, by the way, if black isn't your color, go check out their limited edition frost. But, gents, don't just take my word for it, go over and check out the reviews. And that's why it comes with a two-year warranty. It's a quality product that you can depend on. Now, gents, to grab this trimmer and get the best deal on the web, use that link in the description of today's video. I've got a really good deal. I know their founder, Brio, he's a friend of mine. Basically, you're going to be able to get a free Zero blade. Take advantage of this deal. It's not going to last forever. Go check them out. Great deal down below. Now, what about neck hair? What about sideburns? Again, when you're in your 20s, you're a starving student, yeah, it's okay sometimes to look like you're going eight weeks between haircuts. But, if you're in your 50s out there on the dating scene, you want to look put together. So, in between seeing your barber every few weeks, have a pair of trimmer and make sure to straighten the hair on the side of your face and the back of your neck. Now, we hinted at it, but I want to go a little bit deeper. Let's talk about gray. Now, some of you guys genetically, you're not going to start to gray to probably in your 50s. On the other hand, some of you guys started getting gray hairs in your 20s. And, yeah, now you're 35 and you're mostly salt, not much pepper left. Now, graying is it happens naturally I think is normal. But, people's perception of the color gray with hair is that it does age you, which works for some men. But, if you feel that it's not working for you, I highly recommend you go see it a professional. At least one time because there is a huge industry on the women's side when it comes to coloring. And when you go see a professional who has colored thousands of people's hair, they'll be able to give you a better perspective. They know the best products on the market. And, for a relatively paltry sum, you'll be able to see what the best can do versus if you try to go cheap and do it yourself the first time. Which I know there are different options out there and some of the gradual programs are pretty good, but I have seen it when a guy buys a cheap dye, doesn't know what he's doing and colors his own hair thinking it's going black and he ends up going purple. Yes, I have a friend in his 60s who went from gray to black with a purplish tint. It was hilarious. And, by the way, this applies to your facial hair as well. Now, this next mistake has been made front of so many times in movies, I'm surprised that guys are still making it. And that is they're trying to hide their bald spot with a comb over. Now, for some guys hair loss is gradual, but you got other guys that happens in a matter of a year. Now, if you are experiencing hair loss and you want to stop it, there are options out there. But, if you're not going to do anything about it, if it runs in your family, you pretty much know what's going to happen, then the path that we recommend here is finding a hairstyle that doesn't deny baldness is happening, but instead leans into it and embraces it. And the silver lining here is when you lose the hair on top of your head, all of a sudden you realize, hey, I got to protect the top of my head. So, I find a lot of guys going bald discover the power of hats from flat caps to pantomiles to trilbis. Now, the funny thing about when you're losing the hair on your head is that the hair starts to pop up in other places. All of a sudden, you got it flowing out of your nose, out of your ears, more on your back. Now, I'm not saying you got to be body-scaping all the time. That is a personal choice. But, when it comes to the ear hair, when it comes to the nose hair, I would suggest you do us a public service and take care of those follicles because you don't want them looking like a forest. Again, especially if you're a taller guy, everyone's looking up to you and they can see those bushes coming right out of your nose. Now, the ear hair can sneak up on you, it's a little bit harder to spot. I would recommend though every time you go see your barber, just have them trim those two spots in addition, the eyebrows. Seriously, have you ever noticed on a really old guy how the eyebrows, he's got these crazy long hairs that are going everywhere. Now, mad respect to the guys that are growing that eyebrow hair and actually styling it. But, for the rest of us, what you want to do is just set up a routine to go through and trim it. And we're not going to be like some of the ladies out there plucking out all the hairs and then drawing them on our face. No, just treat it like a normal facial hair and keep it under control. Next up, let's talk about your oral care. Looking at somebody's teeth, this is the easiest way to determine their age. As you get older, your teeth are naturally going to get stained and are going to yellow. Now, with today's dentistry options and over-the-counter whitening treatments, you can hold the standing and yellowing at bay for pretty much the rest of your life. But, if you've got really bad teeth, the enamel is pretty much gone. One option and I know it's expensive, but, man, it can really transform your look is to look at veneers. This is a process where they basically rebuild your teeth and if done right, it can make you look years younger. That being said, you don't have to go extreme. Just go talk with a cosmetic dentist because I know guys in their fifties that have gone in and straightened their teeth and it's made a huge difference. Not only the way they look and feel about themselves, but actually as many dental professionals will tell you it enables you to chew better and your teeth are going to last longer. So, let's talk about your nails. Let's talk about your cuticles. If you don't know what cuticles are, that is the skin that grows on the side and around the nails. And, as you age, some of you guys deal with this because of hereditary reasons, you can actually the cuticles can come off and this can be very painful. Now, some people are born with bad cuticles, but a lot of guys just have bad habits of chewing their nails or picking at their cuticles, which initially they can get away with, but as you get in your thirties, forties, fifties, it can really make your hands look bad. Now, I've seen guys try to break the habit using a clear nail polish that tastes horrible, but the best method I know of that you'll actually enjoy is actually pay and go in and see a nail professional. Yes, get a manicure. Yes, get a pedicure. Treat yourself. You only live once. See what it's like. But, here's the deal. When you spend money on something like that, most of us are going to say, you know what, I am not going to chew on these nails because I spent good money getting them to look good. And, yeah, when you get invited to that pool party and you're wearing flip flops or sandals, you don't have to be embarrassed of the claws on your feet because, yeah, your feet will look good. Seriously, gents, there's not a woman out there who likes being scratched by your toe claws at night under the covers. All right, gents. So, after watching this video, some of you guys are motivated to grow a beard, but you don't know how. Guys, I got you covered right here. It's pretty easy, but I know getting through the different phases, yeah, it can be hard. Check out this video, How to Grow a Beard. Yeah, we break it out. I know it sounds simple, but there are a few tips and tricks to make it easier to make it painless to make it. Yeah, getting out of that awkward phase. We got it covered right here in this video, guys. Go check it out. Boom."

Some combinations are going to make it look great. Other combinations, well, they can make you look like you have no fashion sense at all. So, how to avoid the latter and increase the likelihood you always look great? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video, how to layer your shirt and sweater like a pro. So, first up, we're starting with the basics. If you're going to be layering with a sweater, you want to have the right type of shirt underneath because ideally, you don't want to be having to wash your sweater after everywhere. A shirt serves the purpose of absorbing any sweat, any dirt, any oil that comes off the skin and enables you to get more life out of your expensive sweaters because you're not having to launder them as often, you just throw the shirt in the wash. Now, as such, any shirt that you're going to wear under a sweater, you want it to fit well on the body. A shirt that's too baggy or too large that's worn under a sweater is going to have the effect of creating bulks and wrinkles even under a well-fitted sweater and it's just not going to look good. In addition, most times, you want to find a shirt that has a strong collar. Now, one of the simplest and classic collars to go to when you're layering is a button-down collar. It's a casual style collar made popular on the polo fields, but why men like it when layering is it keeps the collar points in place. And, last but not least, let's talk about shirt length. So, for any man in his 20s or above, I recommend when you're layering to tuck in your shirt. Now, if you're 15 going to a school in which they've got a uniform and you want to push the envelope and go with the half-tucked look to be a rebel, go for it. If they put you into tension, tell me Antonio told you. Next up, let's talk the sweater styles that look best with layering. Starting things off, we got the classic crew neck. Now, as mentioned earlier for a more casual look, you can choose just to wear a t-shirt underneath the crew neck. But, the classic layer look is going to have a collar that just peeps above and is held together closely by the sweater neckline. It's a classic well-established look, although I feel it looks a little bit bunched and I prefer this other style which is the v-neck. Now, v-neck sweaters reveal a little bit more of the color. And, I find that when bringing in a third item like a necktie, they do a better job of showing off the three different texture combinations that you could see in this layered look. And, yes, it's a little bit more fashion for, but I do think you can wear a t-shirt underneath and that combination could look fine. But, having said all that, my favorite sweater style for a guy to layer has got to be the quarter zip or the half zip sweater. And, within this style, I'm also throwing in sweaters that have buttons on them whether it's a button or a zip. It's a very small difference, although buttons in general are going to be more formal. But, yeah, this combination right here is a little bit more moderate and I really like, again, when paired with the right shirt when possibly even paired with a necktie, it does an excellent job bringing in a variety of different materials, different colors, different textures. And, again, because so many of you guys are choosing to not wear a necktie, this is where the accents on the sweaters whether it be the button color, whether it be a suede lining right there next to the zipper. This here all of a sudden is bringing in lines, it's bringing color, it's bringing a little bit more attention to where we want people looking towards you, towards your face. And, if you want some a little bit more unique, stylish, still pretty well laid back, check out the sweater blazer which is a close relative of the cardigan. You can argue a sweater blazer is a little bit more of a structured look, but, no, it's basically cardigans, sweater blazers basically the same thing. And, again, as you can see here, you can make this super casual with a v-neck shirt or you can dress it up with a collared shirt, a really versatile piece to add to your collection. And, speaking of which, all these combinations you like what you've seen so far in today's video, guys, you can grab all these looks over at collars and co. Now, gents, I've been talking about collars and co for years because I love what these guys did. They came into a stale industry and they innovated. They saw so many guys were wearing dress shirts and hated layering them underneath a sweater underneath a sports jacket because they were uncomfortable. They didn't fit well. So, they created the perfect polo dress shirt combination. It's a shirt that has a strong collar and placket of a dress shirt, but the comfort ease fit wear of a polo. And, the result is a shirt that you can dress up, you can dress down, you can layer, you can wear it by itself. Collars and co's dress collar polo is where they started. And, this is still their bestseller. And, guys, when you go look at the different collar options, they got the semi-spread, they've got the English spread, they've got the cutaway collar, and, of course, they've got button-down collars. And, if you live in a hot area, you want a polo that's incredibly breathable, but still has that strong collar, check out their featherweight flex collection. But, collars and co didn't stop at those polos. Of course, they started to get into other pieces of menswear. All the sweaters that we've been talking about in today's video, you can find over at collars and co from the crew next to the v-next to the quarter zips. And, if you want to dress things up, take it to the next level, check out their Maverick performance blazers. And, this is a blazer I actually travel with. Why? Because it's made from a performance material, so it's anti-wrinkle, it's got a four-way stretch, it's comfortable, it fits incredibly well off the rack. And, I love how they got a built-in pocket square. I don't even have to think about that being said. I can fold it in and put it in my own pocket square. In any case, gents, just give them a shot. They're an amazing company. And, again, down in the description of today's video, I'm putting a link to the best deal on the web that you're going to find. So, now, let's talk about color matching. At the beginning of this video, I showed you some various combinations, probably the biggest difference you saw there were the ways that the colors worked with each other. Now, this combination right here is the most muted. We've got a regular gray mixed in with a dark blue. And, the accent color here, like I said, is that little bit of suede right there, that brown, but it definitely doesn't scream in your face. All of these colors right here are what are known as neutrals. Neutrals are those base colors that everything else can be built on. They don't really grab that much attention. But, that's a great thing because they work with each other. They're easy to combine. You don't have to think about as long as you nail the fit, you are going to look good. Now, the next combination I want to talk about is that of a high contrast combination. We see this a lot of times in formal wear, but depending on the style of the materials that are being used, it can also be casual. But, usually for this contrast, we're going to see a light color and a dark color right next to each other. Now, the key with a contrast combination is it draws the eyes in. The darker color is going to be the majority of what we see and the lighter color is going to be used for a little bit of accent contrast, which is exactly what we see in this gray and white shirt combination here. Now, what about when we bring in a pop of color? Now, if there's any mistake I made with this combination right here and that is I brought in too much color. The sweater in of itself is not a common color that you see people pulling off especially men. I'm not sure it works really well with my skin tone. Usually, I go towards more of an olive green, but I wanted to try it out. I do recommend that you try out colors because you're never going to truly know if something works for you until you hold it up next to your face up next to your skin. Now, the shirt contrasts with this word not only because it's a different color, but notice how there's a subtle pattern in the shirt. However, I don't think the contrast is high. I do think the combination works although overall it does lean a little bit more casual. Now, right next to color we've got patterns in texture. So, in general, we're going to see most of the patterns in the shirt. You can bring in a striped or a patterned sweater, but because visually it's something we see more of I think it's harder to pull off and you're not going to get as many miles out of a sweater that has a distinctive pattern. Although there's nothing wrong with that especially if you've already got a lot of solid sweaters in your collection, bringing in something with a little bit of pop, a little bit of pattern is not a bad thing. You're going to be able to mix it and match it with a number of different neutral sweaters. Yeah, by sticking with patterned shirts you're probably going to get more bang for your dollar. But, it's in texture that the sweaters really have the big advantage. With most of the time we're going to see performance fabrics, but usually we're going to have a tight weave that either has a little bit of a sheen or not much to it. The sweaters on the other hand are usually going to have a slight napped surface, so they're going to have that softness to them. And depending on the weave, depending on the knit, you could have knits that are tight, they're going to have a very smooth, thin look to them or you can have heavier knits that are going to have a much bulkier overall textured look and feel. Now, the tighter knit sweaters whether they're made from cotton, wool, or cashmere are going to be the dressier ones and the heavier knit, larger bulkier sweaters, those in general are going to be more casual. But, yeah, when you're layering texture is one of those secret weapons because you can have that cotton shirt with that wool sweater with a silk necktie, all three of them different textures working with each other, you can have the same exact color and yet it's still going to give this really nice elegant layered look. Now, we alluded to it, but I want to talk a little bit more about material matching when it comes to weight. So, whenever something is considered dressier, that's where you've got a thinner sweater, again, it could be made from cotton, wool, usually cashmere or something like that is what you're going to find. But, these are going to be lighter weight and they are going to have shirts underneath them that are of a lighter weight. These are fabrics like performance materials or a thin dress shirt oxford. If you decide to wear a bulkier sweater, something a little bit heavier, then you want to try to match it especially if the shirt is going to be seen with a heavier weight shirt. These are going to be shirts made from at least an oxford type material which is going to be a little bit thicker, a little bit heavier, but you could choose to level up to a flannel which is going to be much thicker, much heavier. And, as you can surmise this combination, it's probably going to keep you a lot warmer. So, reserve this for colder weather. Now, with the combination I'm wearing right here, I've got dress shirt polo made from a performance fabric. Now, the sweater is a lightweight cashmere marina wool and because of the lightness, the overall close fit to the body, I can actually add a third layer which you saw me do earlier with that performance blazer. And that's where I think layering gets really interesting is when you start to have four layers because, yes, that would count as four layers if I was wearing a necktie. But, you see how that combination would work because the level of formality of all four items would be in alignment. And in case you're wondering when it comes to necktie knots, I recommend when you're layering, I like the four in hand or the half Windsor because they're not overly bulky. So, what do you think? A great disagree? What did I miss? Let me know down in the comments below. And, guys, keep watching. I got you another video, boom, right here. I know, yeah, you're going to love it. Check it out. Oh, yeah, right here. Come on, click. You want it, yeah, come on. Yeah, boom, right there."

        "transcript": " So, there's a small horse stable about 45 minutes north of me that I like to take my daughters to to learn how to ride. So, I'm sitting there on the porch watching my girls hanging out with the owner and the traveling ferrier. This cowboy was from Oklahoma originally and he moved up and down the Midwest showing and taking care of horses. And the conversation turns to family and I share that I've got kids from ages two to 20. Now, this 55-year-old cowboy laughs because he's like, man, I got you beat. He's got a 36-year-old son down in Austin and a one-year-old baby girl with his Wisconsin girlfriend. He shares with me some pictures and I can't help but notice his daughter is beautiful because so is his 30-something-year-old girlfriend. And looking at this guy covered in dirt, smell like a barn, most people wouldn't expect him to have that much game. But later on in the conversation, he shared with me he's never had a problem with beautiful women. All he has to do is shower, put on a clean pair of jeans, his nice boots, a starched cotton button down and throw on his hat. And he claimed anytime he walks into a bar or a party, he's got beautiful women coming up to talk to him. And you know what? I 100% believe them. Why? Because growing up in West Texas, I've seen it myself. The reality is, gents, the spirit of the American cowboy is alive and well. And a man that can wear a Western wear with confidence, he's associated with the spirit of the American West, a masculine coat of independence and rugged strength. So, how to leverage the cowboy look even if you've never ridden a horse? Well, gentlemen, that's the subject of today's video. So, let's start things off with the classic Western boot. Now, the three main styles that you need to know are the classic cowboy, the roper, and the square toe work boot. Now, the cowboy style Western boot is perhaps the most iconic of the three. Now, when we look at a boot like this, the first thing we're going to notice is the height of the shaft. The reason for this design is to protect a man's legs whenever he's riding a horse. The toe shape on a classic cowboy boot is also going to be narrow and pointed. This helps the boot slide easily and out of the stirrup. And, right with that, let's talk about the heel. You're going to have one that's moderately tall and angled. Basically, these boots were made for riding. And let's talk about the range of materials. Cowboy boots for over a hundred years have come in a wide range of materials. Most often, a bovine leather, you're also going to see them made from goat, which is a little bit of a softer leather, very comfortable and very malleable to the foot. Ostrich very tough and very recognizable because of the unique pattern. You're also going to see a variety of reptiles. Now, if cowboy boots are made for riding, roper boots are made for working and walking. The shaft on a pair of ropers is going to be shorter sometimes up to 10 inches, but more often than not, down to nine or eight. As it's more of a work and walk boot, the roper also is going to have a shorter, flatter, wider heel. And because this is a boot a lot of guys are working in, 14 to 16 hours a day, it's going to have a wider toe box and because of that, a rounder toe. These boots originated for a man that was spending a lot more time on his feet than in a saddle. And that's how they're still used today. Now, this next dial is a hybrid between the two. Sometimes called the stockman, other times the work boot, one of the more distinctive features we're going to see here is the squared off toe. Now, there's lots of stories as to where this came from, but the one I like is that this working man had to be able to kick things to get them going. So, we wanted a toe that could get the point across, but not too much in puncture. The heel here is going to be lower than the cowboy, a little bit more though than a roper. And the shaft is going to be relatively high about the same as a cowboy boot at about 12 inches. Basically, an all-around versatile boot that can work in the saddle or work on the ground. Now, gents, every boot I just showed you right there, I think any man can incorporate into his wardrobe. The key is finding a style that suits your needs and that you feel comfortable wearing. And, straight up, gents, when it comes to comfort, if you find a pair of Western boots that fits you well, you are never going to find a more comfortable boot out there. Speaking of comfortable boots, guys, if you're in the market for a pair, go check out today's sponsor, Ticovas. Now, gents, when you're holding a pair of Ticovas, what you notice is the quality build and the timeless Western style. Gents, all their boots are made by hand with over 200 individual steps. And, having worn this pair right here now for a couple months, what I can tell you is I love the fact on the first wear, these things were comfortable and they just got better and better with every single wear. And, gents, as we talked about quality boots, they should come in a variety of different materials. Of course, they've got boots in bovine leather, both cowhide and calfskin, but they've also got ostrich, alligator, crocodile, lizard, suede, and, of course, goat. And if you want a fun color, if you want an interesting design, you want a boot that's going to make a statement. They've got you covered, they're over at Ticovas with all their different styles, all their different looks. And if you get a chance, gents, go into one of their stores. They're all over the United States. And personally, I've been to their Austin, I've been to their Dallas, and just recently I was over in their Atlanta store. And I have to say it was a really nice laid-back experience. They've got complimentary drinks, free boot shines. And if you're at all worried about getting the perfect fit, that's what you want to go into the store for, actually try them on. And if you're on the fence about wearing Western boots because the shaft is too high, you're not sure how it's going to look on the repair your jeans, then you want to check out their jeans. This is a zip boot with a relatively modest shaft that's going to give you a classic boot silhouette look. Without you having to modify anything in your wardrobe because you can wear this with any type of jeans. Again, gents, if you're looking for any style of Western boots or Western wear, they've got a wide selection, go over and check out Ticovas. And as always, gents, I got the best deal on the web for you. Use that link, go over to Ticovas, check them out. If you're looking to level up your wardrobe with some Western wear, check out what Ticovas has to offer. Now, the next style tip to steal from a cowboy to look good, guys, add Western jeans to your rotation. Now, there are three key features with typical Western jeans. First up, they're going to have a little bit of a flare, a boot cut at the bottom of the jeans. And we're not talking bell bottoms here. In fact, the amount is relatively small, anywhere from three quarters to in some cases an inch and a half of extra room. But this extra material is key if you're going to be wearing boots with these jeans as you want the material to slide over easily and not make the wearing of the boots uncomfortable. The second key characteristic of a good pair of Western jeans, they fit the man well in the crotch, butt, and leg, and thigh area. Now, remember growing up and seeing women wear these shirts. Now, I haven't seen the date of how many women believe this, but I do think if you've got a decent build and you're in a pair of jeans like this and you wear them with confidence, yeah, you may turn a few heads. But in case you're wondering the real reason for a snug fit, is it well-fitted jeans on an able-bodied man actually give him more room to move? Is anyone can tell you who works around machinery or animals loose clothing can get you killed? So, it makes sense a lot of Western wear especially jeans fit close to the body. Oh, and by the way, almost all Western denim is going to be dark in color and made to be durable and washed repeatedly. Next up, we've got the snap button cotton shirt. So, snap buttons in their modern form have been around for over 150 years. The original idea of the snap button was to make it easy to fasten clothing when you were wearing work gloves. And although they're a little bit more expensive than buttons, they're a heck of a lot more durable and it makes sense that the Western world would pick up on it. Now, starting in the 1940s, there was a shirt maker named Jack Well. He started putting snap buttons on all of his Western wear clothing. It was picked up by Hollywood and all of a sudden became the fashion. Now, a couple other details I want to talk about with Western wear shirts is we're often going to see the double flap pocket. A vestige of military wear does make the shirt more casual, but they are functional and from a style perspective, they actually build up the chest a bit. And, right with that, let's talk about the shoulder yolks. Have you ever noticed on a lot of Western wear shirts that we see the construction of the shirt is a little bit different? Now, depending on the shirt maker, the Western yoke can actually be set in or it can be sewn on top of a set in sleeve and regular yoke. And the purpose here originally was to provide reinforcement. I mean, if you're going to be throwing a calf on your shoulder day in, day out, you want a shirt that's going to be durable, that's going to be tough, that isn't going to need to get restitched every other day. Now, if sewn in and historically, if you know clothing, most of it was actually made by hand for individuals. So, custom tailored workwear isn't as fancy as it sounds nowadays, but basically you could get a work shirt with a higher armhole, which actually gives you a lot more freedom of movement. You'll also see the shoulder yoke design on a number of other garments, outerwear, vests. And when you've got a contrasting color to it or if the yoke is actually made of leather or a rougher material, it definitely gives a feeling of casual workwear and that Western vibe to it. Which, by the way, a puffer jacket, especially a puffer vest made from a rougher canvas-like material, yeah, either one of these would be a great Western addition to your wardrobe. Now, speaking of jackets, let's look at the iconic trucker jacket. Durable, functional, lightweight, these are great jackets that you can throw in the back seat, but because they're made from denim or a canvas material that's basically resistant to abrasion, these type of jackets are perfect for adding a little bit of warmth but a lot of protection. Another key characteristic that makes a jacket popular is how high it sits on the waist because it fits close to the body and doesn't restrict the torso turning left or right. This jacket is an excellent choice for a man getting in and out of a vehicle who needs to work. And if you like this style, but you want better protection from the rain, the elements, the wind, then go for a waxed canvas version. Yeah, you're going to have to rewax it every season, but this is going to do a good job of keeping moisture at bay. Now, what if you want something a little bit softer? You want something with a little bit more insulation then look to a Southwestern style sweater. So, about 150 years ago when transportation was more expensive and we had mills on both sides of the coast, there were a number of woolen mills on the west coast that produced unique type of fabrics. One of them was a company called Pendleton and they produced a number of patterns that became iconic for the families and men working in the frontier. The key with these fabrics is they used a lot of earthen colors. They had very unique Southwest and Northwest patterns to them and above all, they were functional. They were warm, they were durable. Now, if you've got a pair of jeans, you've got to have a Western belt, right? Well, if you know your history, you know that cowboys actually used to wear suspenders. But, that being said, from the Vicaros out of Mexico, there is a history of leatherwork belts and flashy metal combinations. But, the Western belt as we know, it didn't really emerge for about a hundred years and although a lot of us would like to think it evolved from the gun belt, the classic Western belt probably evolved more likely from the dress belt. However, unlike its skinny thin cousin, the classic Western belt is going to be thicker, heavier, and is made to hold a larger buckle, which takes us to the next item you may want to bring in your wardrobe, an intricate metal buckle. Now, really quick, I want to be clear if you have not earned a fancy Western buckle, which many men and women do participating in rodeos, barrel riding competitions, roping competitions. If you didn't earn it, don't wear it. But, when it comes to intricate metals especially in a classic buckle shape, there's nothing wrong with pulling this off. Now, the next item on this list takes a little bit more courage to wear. That being said, it's the official neck wear of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and most recently, Texas. And, when I find really interesting about this neck piece is how it's been going in and out of style for almost 200 years. In fact, on different continents as well, with the teddy boys over in the UK wearing these in the 1950s. But, if you know the Bolo's history, you know it's 100% Americana. Now, is this as formal as a necktie or even a bowtie? Well, technically in the right setting, the answer is yes. But, because in general, the clothing you be wearing with is going to be more casual, it's really hard to pull it off in a formal setting. But, it can be done especially when it is your style and you own the look with confidence. Now, as we're talking about jewelry and shiny things, let's talk about silver and turquoise accessories. With this metal combination, you're going to see rings, you're going to see necklaces, you're going to see bracelets. I know there are those out there that hate the look. I actually had an uncle that pulled this off really well. It was just who he was. He always wore this jewelry and it was part of his style. So, yeah, if it tickles your fancy, if you like it, if you can wear it confidently, go for it. Now, you've probably been waiting for it, but this is the one piece, the one accessory that I think you really have to own it. You've really got to wear this piece with confidence to be able to pull it off. Gents, I'm talking the iconic cowboy hat, the cattleman. Now, for me personally, I don't wear one. Despite growing up on a ranch, raising horses, knowing how to ride, it just wasn't my style. But, if I were to start with one, I would definitely go with a straw cattleman. It's functional, it's lightweight, and I feel the overall light color is easy to match with any outfit. Agree, disagree. Let me know in the comments below. And if you're interested in learning more about boots, gentlemen, I got you covered with this video right here. I go deep in on Western boots, so go check it out. I think you will enjoy it. Oh, yeah, right there. Boom. Yeah, go check it out."

        "transcript": " I'd be willing to bet you a thousand dollars that if you wore a suit for a week in public that you'd receive confidence. Some of you guys would get a double take. You'd have random people you don't know show you more respect, and on top of all that, you would feel more confident. Now, without even knowing you, how can I be so confident about this? Because for over a decade, I've studied the effects of clothing on human behavior. Again and again, we see men that dress well, men that wear a suit are treated better than men that don't, men that dress down. Now, the reason is simple. Most people have a cognitive bias that a well-dressed individual is of higher status. They're wealthier, they're more intelligent, they're more powerful. Now, is this 100% accurate? Of course not. But is it a reality of life? You betcha. You see, human beings use mental shortcuts to be able to make decisions quickly and efficiently. These shortcuts rely on surface information. Our physical appearance, how we dress, being one of the most influential. Understanding this gentleman is why I make the claim especially in today's day and age when most people are dressing down that every man must own a suit that fits him well, looks good and makes him feel like a million bucks. Now, gents, all the looks, all the clothing you're seeing in today's video is brought to you by Suit Supply. Now, as many of you guys know for over a decade, I have had a love affair with Suit Supply. Way before they became a sponsor, they had my credit card information because I was going in there and spend my own money on sports jackets, suits, shirts. When you go into their store, gents, let me warn you, you are going to fall in love. These guys have to be one of the best menswear stores on the planet because it doesn't matter if you're just getting into style, if you have been in the style for 20 years. You can walk into a Suit Supply and find looks, find inspiration, and find classic wardrobe pieces that are going to enhance your wardrobe. Now, over the years, I've tasted pretty much everything Suit Supply has to offer from their custom clothing options which are awesome to their off-the-rack options which are affordable. Before talking their perennial suit collection starting at $4.99, these are going to be the colors, these are going to be the fabrics that never go out of style. Now, gents, they've got stores all around the U.S. and we'll list a whole bunch of locations right here. And if one isn't close to you then make it a destination, it is worth the drive. And when it comes to quality, these guys punch above their price. I used to own a clothing. I know how to take apart clothing, look at all the details.

Gents, Suit Supply is where it's at. Again, I'm linking to them down in the description of today's video. Go check out that link, the best deal on the web. I've got it for you down here. Opportunity finds the well-dressed man. So, you've probably heard the saying that opportunity is luck meeting preparation. Well, I'm not going to go so far as to say that wearing a suit one time is going to change your life, but I wouldn't be surprised if every time you wore a suit opportunity found you. Because here's the thing, every single interaction you have with another person, every time you're mixing in with a crowd, every time you walk past a beautiful woman, there is an opportunity there. Now, whether or not a person decides to engage with another person often depends on what they see, the visual cues they're given. So, when you look at the part of a success, when you come off is more attractive. When you're sending a signal wearing clothing that accentuates your build to show that you take care of yourself, don't be surprised, gentlemen, when opportunity starts to fall into your lap. In a casual world, a man in a suit stands out. Now, a lot of guys out there are saying, well, that's all fine and dandy, but I'm a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy. Well, first up, when the suit fits and it's made from a quality of material, it can be incredibly comfortable. But, before we get into that, are you sure you're a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy? Or is that a style your mom chose for you when you were eight and you stuck with it? My point is I think your clothing should reflect who you are and who you aspire to be. So, that best version of yourself that you are working hard to become in the next few years, what does he dress like? And doesn't he have the courage to dress in a way that he stands out from the crowd? A suit can be the most versatile piece of clothing in your wardrobe. Now, I know some of you guys are thinking, come on, suits, they're boring and I don't need to ever get dressed up. Now, we'll address that latter point here in a few minutes, but let me address that misconception that suits are only formal wear. Gents, of course, you can dress up a suit, but you could also dress down a suit. In fact, if you go with a neutral color like gray here, look at the different shirts, look at the different sweaters, the different combinations that you can put together with just a few pieces of clothing. Look at this combination right here. I'm just wearing the jacket with a pair of jeans, this turtleneck sweater. This is a great fall and winter look. A well-tailored suit levels up performance. Now, if you're still on the fence about wearing a suit because you're like, Antonio, my job doesn't require it. Well, what does your job require? That you are working at a high level if you want to get a promotion or if you're running your own company, you probably know the saying, you eat what you kill, right? Well, here's the deal. You ever hear of in-cloth cognition? This is a new field of study emerged about 20 years ago and it's where researchers were able to replicate and show again and again when people dressed a certain way, they performed at a higher level. Now, the classic study was with doctor jackets which when they thought they were wearing a doctor jacket, they would score higher on exams versus a painter's smock. But there was a recent study out of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology that demonstrated that when participants wore formal clothing, a.k.a. a suit, they actually exhibited higher cognitive ability. They also negotiated better. And as you guys know, negotiations are one of the most important things that can make or break a business. It can mean the difference between you losing a $5 million deal or closing that $5 million deal. And when you do close that $5 million deal, make sure to send me a commission check. I'll put my address right down there in the description of today's video. But, seriously, gents, why not increase your odds? Why not dress the part and increase your likelihood of success? Your suit is a style conduit. Now, this next one came to me the other day when I was watching that new series, He-Man, have you seen it? I know it's a cartoon, but, hey, I'm a kid of the 80s. I grew up watching that stuff so it was cool to see them actually pick up where they left off. In any case, I'm sorry to ruin it for you, but He-Man was able to transform without his sword. And he made a point of explaining that the sword, yeah, that's nothing more than a conduit. See the sword is just the conduit. Which also reminded me of Thor in the movie Ragnarok when he loses Jonathan. Again, later in the movie, we have Odin remind Thor that the hammer was nothing more than a conduit of his power. My point, gentlemen, is that when you wear a suit, this is like your style conduit. You see, I believe you're a great guy. If you're watching my videos, you are all about self-improvement and looking your best. And when you put on a suit, this is a conduit that brings it all together. A well-fitted suit makes you look good especially if you spend some time in the gym. It builds up the shoulder, slims up the silhouette, makes your hands look larger. Overall, it gives you a more masculine silhouette. Your suit in a way unlocks your potential. It allows you to more clearly display your confidence, your competence, your power. Now, if you can't tell, I'm enjoying myself in today's video. And I do have to warn you that if you use this information, you're at risk of getting too many compliments. Seriously, I was at a conference the other day in Dallas. Everyone else is dressed down, I'm dressed up looking good, and I got so many compliments. It was almost distracting. I just had to power through it. But, seriously, I mean, you get so many people throwing this at you. I would joke and say, you know, if I dressed down, you wouldn't believe what I do for a living. And that takes me to my next point, people treat a man in a suit better. Now, in spite with the pop culture may try to tell you, the world is not fair. And I think most of us have figured it out. But with suits, man, it is a shortcut to immediately getting treated with more respect. An example of this when I'm in a group with three other guys we're talking and somebody else comes up at a conference, what I find again because I am the guy wearing a sports jacket or a suit, I am looked to as the guy in charge, the authority. Now, it probably also helps I've got good manners and I quickly introduce myself, introduce other people. But, this simple display of good manners and dressing well instantly in this person's mind who I just met, well, they put me up as an authority, they put me up as this higher status individual. A suit as a signature look helps you become memorable. Now, I don't know about you, but for me, names are hard to remember. The reason for that is most western names are arbitrary versus characteristics or interesting facts about that person's life. Those things for me seem a lot easier to remember. But, have you ever noticed how you rarely forget a face? Think about that for a second. I mean, most faces are pretty much the same two eyes and nose and mouth, yet visually we're able to remember all of these small details that allow us to differentiate between thousands of people we meet over a lifetime. But, guess what? It doesn't just stop at the face, you're also in many ways going to remember the way the person presents themselves. And whether it's good or bad, you're going to associate that feeling with them in your memory of them. So, why not associate yourself with a look that is going to be remembered in a good way like with a suit? A well-fitted suit is not uncomfortable, it's just unfamiliar. All right, gents, so I know the ultimate red flag to a lot of guys why they don't wear a suit on a daily basis, they think it's uncomfortable. Well, gents, here's a straight up fact. If the suit is cut well, if it fits your body well, it's not uncomfortable, you're just unfamiliar with the way it feels on your body. And, like any good habit that you change up like going to the gym, initially it feels odd wearing something like this. But, after a few wearings, all of a sudden you start to get used to it. You start to become acclimated to looking at yourself in the mirror and saying, damn, I look good. And let's face it, you don't have to wear a necktie although when you do, again, you are going to stand out from the crowd, but you can put together a casual ensemble. As you see in most of my videos, I'm wearing a collared shirt without a necktie. The fact of the matter is, gents, the act of wearing a structured jacket can become a habit in a matter of weeks by simply implementing a few changes in your wardrobe. A classic suit never goes out of style. So, what about money? So, first up, athleisure, streetwear, that stuff is expensive. And those graphic tees go out of style fast and fast fashion pieces fall apart after a few washes. Classic timeless menswear, guys, it isn't going anywhere. In fact, the classic suit jacket has been around for over 150 years. And the way fabrics are made and if you take care of it, you're going to be able to wear that suit for 20 years. In fact, the only issue may be your waist and you outgrown it. It doesn't matter what your body looks like. In a suit, you'll look better. Straight up, gents, if you're tall and lanky, if you are short and stout, if you've got a big belly or you got crooked shoulders, gents, a suit jacket is the great equalizer. The garment was specifically designed to drape on the body to help a man look better. So, if you're in shape, a well-fitted suit will show that off. If you're out of shape, a well-fitted suit is going to make you look taller, leaner, more masculine. Straight up, gents, a suit is perhaps the most sophisticated, strongest, sexiest thing a man can wear. And with that being said, gents, how to suit up. I got you covered in this video. If you are ready to suit up, you want to know exactly how a suit should fit, how to put it together, everything you need for a great looking suit, boom. I got you covered with this video right here. Oh, yeah. Continue the viewing experience. Come on. I got you right here. Go check it out. Solid video. Everything you need to suit up, yeah. Right there."

        "transcript": " I took a little walk down memory lane the other day as I was transferring a bunch of my video projects from 2024 over to my long-term storage hard drives. And I ended up going all the way back to 2014 when I very first started my blog and I started going through a bunch of those old articles that I wrote way back then. And it's pretty interesting looking 10 years in the past and then I guess looking where I'm at today. And if you would have told me 10 years ago that I'd be making YouTube videos for a living, I would have thought you were completely crazy. Anyway, I thought it might be kind of fun to bring you guys back in time with me and show you how I got this whole thing started and talk about some of the things that happened along the way. So back in 2014, I started getting into fitness and I lost almost 40 pounds. So when you lose that kind of weight, like none of your clothes fit anymore. So at that point, I was in my early 40s, I needed to buy pretty much an entire new wardrobe. And I was trying to figure out like what to buy, right? I knew that I didn't want to dress like an old man, but I also didn't want to look like a teenager either. And that kind of started the whole thing. Basically, I was trying to figure out how to look cool and relevant, but also age appropriate and professional without being too stuffy. And I guess it was about halfway through 2014 in July that I first started the 40 Over Fashioned website. Now, before you go look at it, I mean, it's still there, but just realize I haven't touched it in years. I was writing articles about menswear and then sort of all of the things that I was going through as a guy in my early 40s. I wrote about shorts, I wrote about shoes, I went to go buy a suit and I wrote about that. I had to get some items tailored. So I wrote articles about that. I wrote about sweaters, pocket squares, basically anything that I could think of. And it's funny looking back, it looks like I wrote exactly 51 articles in 2014. And what happened during that time was sort of interesting because most of the style bloggers at that time were young women. I was one of only a few male style bloggers, especially in the Seattle area. And I was the only one talking to an older demographic. And I guess that made me sort of interesting. I ended up winning this little street style contest on Instagram that the Bellevue collection was running. And I guess I caught the attention of their marketing people. So they started inviting me to like all of these events. Now Bellevue collection is this really high end shopping area in downtown Bellevue. It's a really nice part of town, it's just east of Seattle and they pretty much have everything that you could possibly want. They also hosted a lot of these fashion events throughout the year with their main one being this Bellevue fashion week. There were events and fashion shows the entire week. And their biggest fashion show was in partnership with Vogue magazine and that was called Front Row Fashion Show. And that was a pretty cool time because I got to meet a lot of other style bloggers and it was really fun going to all these shows and these events. Another highlight from 2014 was that I was contacted by Macy's to style and host their Men's Night Out event. Basically they were promoting their menswear department and they wanted me to style the mannequins and also live models. They had me come in about a week before and I got to pull a bunch of clothing and have the models do a test fitting. Essentially I was in charge of styling the whole thing. I had a little table set up and there were just a lot of sales associates and stylists from Macy's that were all promoting the menswear department. It was very cool and very fun seeing all of these guys, these models wearing everything that I pulled and the feedback I got was awesome. I was also going to all of these Seattle Fashion Week events and Metropolitan Fashion Week events all in Seattle. And in 2015 I was approached by an agency that was in charge of social media campaigns for different automobile companies. Basically what would happen is they would drop off a brand new car at my house. I would get to drive it for a week and they'd come pick it up at the end of the week. And all I had to do in exchange was to take some photos and write an article about it. I just remember how cool that felt. Like they just would bring me this car and let me use it for the whole week. Now the first car they brought me was this brand new 2015 Cadillac ATS coupe. I love that car. It looked cool, it was quick, it was comfortable, the interior was really nice and it basically suited my style at that time perfectly. But back then I couldn't afford even buying one. Another one they sent me was the GMC Acadia Denali. That thing was also super cool and I enjoyed the entire time that I had with it. Now I have done a few other little promotions like this. Most recently I guess it was about two, maybe three years ago with Mazda. But this is definitely something that I would like to do more of in the future because as you guys know, if you follow me and from my racing background, you know I'm a car guy. About halfway through 2015, I ended up moving to Southern California and I slowed down how much I was posting on the blog. Life got quite a bit different when I moved. So 2015, 2016 and 2017, I think I was posting maybe 20 or 30 articles per year on the website and that was about it. Now up until this point, I made a few videos for YouTube but the only goal with that was just driving traffic back to my main website. I really didn't understand YouTube at all back then but in 2018, I started making YouTube videos on a fairly regular basis. I was trying to make a video every week and sometimes I did but I think that year I maybe made 31 videos and one of those videos put me on the map. November 11th, 2018, I published a video called Mistakes Older Guys Make Trying to Look Youthful. I think I had maybe 1,000 subscribers or so at that point so when I made that video, it just sat there for four months with hardly any views and for whatever reason on February 11th, 2019, that video was viewed over 101,000 times in that single day and still to this day, I have no idea what happened but I guess that just shows you the power of the algorithm. So now it's got almost like 2.7 million views at this point and I've also picked up 81,000 new subscribers just based on that one video and lifetime, I've earned almost 10 grand just from that one video. I also got a lot of hate comments from that video. The comments I was getting before this were like super positive, like people were excited that there was finally somebody out there talking to the older demographic but for whatever reason, this one got me a lot of hate for the very first time and I wasn't ready for it. And it took me a little while to sort of figure out what was going on because I didn't know and I still don't know why it took off the way it did and I didn't know why people were being so mean when all I was trying to do was help people. Anyway, I finally had to realize that it was time to either sink or swim. I developed a thick skin pretty quickly and it made me just want to do more and work harder. So that year in 2019, I went full steam ahead with YouTube and produced 101 videos. I also went to the Menfluential Conference in Atlanta hosted by of course, Aaron Marino and Antonio Centeno and that was in late February. Now this was a really cool conference. I got recognized a little bit because of the popularity of that one video and I got to meet and hang out with some really cool people. Something else happened in 2019. I met some of the guys from Menfluential Media during the conference and they talked to me a little bit about testing brand deals with me on my channel. Now this would be good for a few different reasons. First of all, I get free stuff. Second, it helps me be creative and come up with new ideas to promote the product. And third, of course, I get paid for it but it wasn't much at first because I was simply untested. Also at this time, I was working with my girlfriend as a wedding photographer and videographer and I was also making two to three videos per week on YouTube. I don't think I had a day off that entire year and I was still just kind of scraping by. So in 2020, I was actually invited to come speak at the Menfluential Conference. Now I think it was in late February, like before the whole world shut down but that was a life-changing experience for me. So leading up to the conference, I was supposed to submit a few paragraphs of my speech ahead of time so they had an idea of what I was gonna be talking about. What I submitted was not what I ended up talking about. I think I submitted something about older men not getting the attention that they deserve and that your life isn't over yet and it's never too late to make changes in your life. But what I ended up talking about was how much my life was in absolute turmoil and how YouTube and the guys at Menfluential Media basically saved my life and I connected with a lot of guys. There's a video on my channel called I Lost Everything and that is a video recording of that speech. Now I don't even remember it happening but when I was done, I received a standing ovation and I think it was the only standing ovation that anybody had ever received during the conference or at least that's what I was told. The rest of that conference was a complete blur. So many different people wanted to come talk to me after that and tell me their story and at one point I think I had a line of like 10 people that wanted to talk to me. It was absolutely insane but it was also very beautiful at the same time. The rest of 2020 was again, full steam ahead and I think I produced 110 videos that year. In 2021, again, full steam ahead and I think I did 116 videos. In 2022, I made 128 videos. In 2023, I think it was 113 videos and 2024 was 107 videos. Now I've been able to meet some amazing people through YouTube and do some pretty cool collaborations. My plans for 2025 are to sort of shake things up a little bit. I will be doing more collaborations. I'll be doing video podcast, I'll be doing more interviews and I would like to talk about more interesting topics and have more in-depth conversations and not keep it so surface level all the time. And as a lot of you guys know, I'm also launching a brand new wine brand this year. I'd also like to connect more with you again at some local meetups here in Southern California. It's been too long and the ones I've done in the past have been absolutely amazing and I met some really great people and some of which have become some personal friends of mine. So if that might be something you can get on board with, please stick around this year and engage with my videos. It definitely helps the algorithm. And with that, my friends, as always, thank you so much for watching, live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Hey, you have any plans this weekend? No? Well, get some because you're going out and if you keep watching this video, you will know exactly what to wear because maybe you're going out somewhere casual on Friday night but then you're going to go get a nice dinner somewhere on Saturday night and then maybe you're going to go get some beers with your boys on Sunday and watch the game. Either way, I've got you covered. But really quick, before I get into all of this, listen, you don't have to wear anything that I'm going to be showing you. If it's not your style, don't worry about it, brother. You do you. It's all good. I'm just trying to help out with some fresh ideas, right? And my personal style tends to lean a little more on the polished casual side. I don't wear suits and ties very much, but I also don't wear t-shirts and ripped up jeans either. Speaking of jeans though, let me show you a couple of ideas that are more on the casual side, but also still nice enough to pull off at your average to above average restaurant. Starting at the ground and working our way up. So on my feet, I've got some nice brown Chelsea boots. I've also got some medium wash blue jeans on my legs. On my upper half, I've got a couple of different layers. So I'm wearing a white button down collar polo, a navy blue v-neck sweater and of course this brown suede bomber jacket. Both the polo shirt and the sweater are from Collars and Co. And I'm going to be showing a couple of their pieces throughout the video that work really well together. Now look, as you can see, the fit on everything is perfect and it's still a very casual outfit that doesn't look too stuffy or too dressy. I mean, it's polished, it's mature, it's good looking. And I think just about any guy can pull this off and look amazing. For this next one, I'm going with gray suede Chelsea boots, light tan denim and then the same white polo shirt, this gorgeous black ribbed sweater and this black wax canvas jacket. Now the jacket on its own is a very nice piece, but this sweater is one of my favorites right now. It's got just a little bit of weight to it without being too chunky and I love the cool button detail on the neckline. You can wear the sweater with the collar up or with the collar down. And I also really love the contrast between the black sweater and the light tan jeans. Once again, it's casual, but it's also just a touch elevated if you will. And the bonus is, so here's the deal, if you're carrying maybe a couple extra pounds around the middle, go with light color pants like this and then a black sweater like this to add some contrast because the lighter color tones draws the eye and the black top helps minimize size. And gentlemen, if you've heard me talk about Collars and Colby four in other videos, but you haven't yet checked them out, you've got to do it now because they have got a lot of really cool brand new pieces on their website. Now of course they're known for those amazing dress collar polos and from being on Shark Tank, but they also have some different styles of polos, amazing lightweight sweaters, long sleeve sweater polos and of course some heavier weight sweaters that are great for colder weather. I am pretty much obsessed right now with their long sleeve Marina wool polos and you're going to see me wearing two different versions in just a minute coming up, but I really do think that you should go check out their website and surf around to look at everything they have. Now their dress collar polos are absolutely amazing for layering because they're made with this really nice lightweight wrinkle resistant four way stretch material and because they're short sleeve, they're easy and comfortable to wear under a sweater. And there's going to be a link down below in the description to a special offer that's going to get you a discount on anything that you want to go pick up. And like I said, I really do encourage you guys to go surf around their site and see all the new stuff they have. Use the link in the description to treat yourself to something brand new that you'll actually wear and enjoy the season. Okay, the last casual look with jeans. I'm going with these brown loafers, this pair of dark wash denim, a brown fitted sweater and this blue suede bomber jacket. And if you missed any of my other videos where I've talked about color matching and color theory and complementary colors on the color wheel, you'll know that blue and brown always look great together. Now as you can see for this look, I'm going with darker tones for a less contrasty look. Now the darker tones I think would be perfect for like a casual Friday night outing or even a low key casual date night. Now you could absolutely wear the white polo shirt under the sweater so that you could see the color, but I've just been really into wearing these fitted sweaters on their own recently. I think it's just a really cool look and it's not too serious. All right, now stepping things up, just a notch, we're going with some chinos. All right, so I've got the same brown loafers, some light gray chinos and this blue long sleeve polo. Now this polo is super nice and it's made out of marino wool. So you could consider this like a long sleeve polo sweater. It feels amazing and it fits amazing. And this is something I would absolutely wear out on the weekend. I mean, it looks nice. It's a little bit elevated without being too serious and it looks classy. Maybe what I'm looking for if I'm going to head out on Friday or Saturday night. Now if you've got a date, this would be perfect, but maybe you're heading out by yourself or with a couple of buddies and maybe you're looking to meet some new lady friends. Once again, this is perfect. All right, for this one, I went back to the brown Chelsea boots. I also went with a pair of navy chinos, the button down color polo and this navy blue v-neck sweater also from collars and coat. Like I said, they've got everything. This whole look is absolutely my speed right now because I've just been really into these dark tones in monochromatic combinations lately. I think just about anyone can pull this off and look amazing. I mean, you've got dark blue against dark blue, a really good shoe choice and that little pop of white from the collar adds just a little hint of sophistication. Alrighty, now we're getting into your nicer Saturday night option. So I'm going with some black loafers, some gray patterned dress trousers and a black marina wool long sleeve polo. This is absolutely my speed. So if you're taking yourself out or your lady friend out to a nice restaurant or maybe you're going to go check out the sexy little cocktail lounge to take in maybe some live music, this combination would be perfect. And this one's optional, but something else that you might want to pay attention to. If you're a single guy and you walk into like a lively cocktail bar or lounge with good vibes, chances are you're going to be better dressed than like 99% of all the other guys in that room. And if you're up for conversation, you shouldn't have any trouble attracting some ladies to talk to. I'm not trying to be douchey, I promise. I'm just saying it's true. Okay, one more Saturday night outfit. All right, so this time I grabbed some brown brogues, some blue patterned dress trousers and once again, the same blue marina wool long sleeve polo that I'm wearing right now. This is a 10 out of 10 classy, sophisticated, but also somewhat youthful and energetic outfit that a lot of guys can easily pull off. I mean, just think about it. It's nice, but it's not overly nice. It's classy without being stuffy. It's masculine without shouting about it. You look like you give a shit and you look like you know exactly what you're doing. And even if you're with your girlfriend or your wife of 20 years, don't think for a second that she wouldn't appreciate you stepping things up just a little bit and dressing kind of like this. It goes both ways, right? Because you want her to put in effort and look good and she wants you to put in effort and look good. All right, now it's Sunday and you're heading out to watch the game somewhere. Go with simple sneakers, casual denim, a white shirt also from collars and cope. But this time it's their PK cotton polo and this lightweight hoodie also from collars and coat. Again, I'm telling you, they've got everything. Now you can easily go with just a t-shirt or maybe a football jersey underneath the hoodie, but because my Seahawks are out of the playoffs, even with the 10 and seven record, I decided to go with just a casual white polo. It looks nice and put together without being like overdressed for whatever sports bar you might be at.

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, listen, getting older is a fact of life, of course, but becoming boring and stuck in your ways as you get older, that's optional. Your 40s should be some of the best years of your life. And if you've reached this point, you've already figured out that life doesn't come with an instruction manual. But the good news is, you don't need one, right? You just need some practical tips and a willingness to improve yourself. Because here's the thing, it's really not that hard. And I want you to stay tuned because I'm going to give you several different ways to level up your game because better men simply lead better lives. Now first things first, improve your personal style. But if you're the type of guy that always says that you don't care how you look and you don't care how you dress and that you don't care what people think of you and you only dress for comfort, blah, blah, blah. If that's you, you're probably going to get triggered by this video. And if so, that's on you. The fact is that dressing better doesn't mean that you need to look like some runway model or that you're trying to impress other people. But you do need to look like a grown man who's got his life together, not like an overgrown 14-year-old boy. I know, tough love here. So for example, if you're not quite sure what colors to wear, just stick with basic, classic, simple colors like navy, black, gray, brown, and white. Black wash jeans that aren't distressed and ripped up and that actually fit your body, that's going to be a game changer for you. Clean quality shoes, that's another simple upgrade. Neutral, solid color, well-fitting t-shirts, polo shirts, and button-ups, that's another upgrade. And if you're a boot guy, something in a medium brown, Chelsea boot or Chuka boot, that's going to retain some of that edge that you probably like and also make you look like a badass. Oh, and please. Ditch your flip-flops and ditch the white socks. You're better than that. The next not-hard thing that you can do, especially if you're in your 40s, is to start taking better care of the skin on your face. And this is where I tend to get some pushback from a few guys. And I'm not even sure really why, because what I'm going to show you solves the problem of starting and keeping a skincare routine that makes you look and feel amazing. T-Shanley Skincare For Men is sponsoring today's video, and this is a product that I've been using and spending my own money on for about the last seven years. I believe in this stuff because it works for me. It's uncomplicated and it only takes a few minutes. T-Shanley's performance-driven formulas are made to address the different needs that men have so you can feel great about the way your skin looks and feels. And this comes in very handy, especially if you're in sales or starting a new job or meeting up on that first date. And if you're just getting started, I would recommend starting out with their Level 1 system which comes with all the basics. You get a daily face wash, an exfoliating scrub that you can use twice a week, a morning moisturizer with SPF 20, and a nighttime moisturizer. But if you want to level up a little bit and get the same stuff that I use, get the Level 3 kit that comes with everything that I just mentioned. Plus, you'll get the anti-aging super serum and an eye solution to handle those crow's feet around your eyes. When it comes to skincare, prevention is everything. So start fighting those signs of aging today and your future self will definitely thank you. There's going to be a link down below in the description that's going to save you 40% on your first box today. And with your order, you can also choose to receive this precision crafted nail kit that's valued at $24 completely free. Plus, if you sign up as a member, you'll get 20% off for life. Not only that, but you can now find tea-channels at hundreds of stores in the US. Click the link down below to find a store near you. But if you want to shop the best offer, shop through my link right now and be on your way to better and healthier looking skin. Alright, something else that you can start doing is to develop a fitness routine that works for you. Because let's face it, your metabolism probably isn't what it used to be and the beer belly isn't going to disappear all by itself. But here's the thing. You don't need to be a gym rat to get into decent shape. You can start simple. Go for a 20 minute walk every day. And if you're at home, do some push-ups, squats, crunches, tricep dips, and some stretching. And if you are like me and you need some accountability, just go hire a personal trainer and go to the gym at least twice a week. Consistency beats intensity every time and you don't need to lift like a bodybuilder. Just move your body on a regular basis. But the key is finding something that you enjoy because if you hate jogging, you're not going to do it. So don't even try. The best workout is the one you'll actually stick to. Here's another one. Work on effective communication. Having good communication is a game changer and it's really not that hard. It can make your relationships smoother and your work interactions a lot better. And here's what I mean. Start by listening more than you talk. Most people just aren't listening. They're just waiting for their turn to talk. Try not to be that guy. Show some genuine interest in what the other person has to say. Be clear and direct. If you need something, say so. Don't dance around the point. Now I might be guilty of this next one from time to time, but texting the letter K is not proper communication. If somebody took the time to message you, at least respond with actual words. Next is having some financial discipline. Look, money can be a big source of stress or it can be a source of freedom. It kind of depends on how you handle it. Being financially disciplined means living within your means and also planning for the future. Start by cutting out those unnecessary expenses. I mean, do you really need 12 streaming services? Little success is it's less about how much money you actually make and more about how you manage what you do have. A little discipline goes a long way. Here's another one. Build a network of like-minded men. You are the average of the five people that you spend the most time with, so choose wisely. Surround yourself with other men who inspire, challenge, and also support you. And that's totally, totally true because most of the guys that I hang out with on a pretty regular basis are doing a lot better than I am and it motivates me to do better and work harder. You can join a club or a group. It can be fitness, hobbies, or volunteering. You can also reach out to some old friends and rekindle those relationships. Also be open to meeting new people because you never know who might become a lifelong friend. It's not a hard thing to do that makes an immediate impact on your self-worth and how you feel is just being nice to other people without the need for anything in return. Just be cool to people. Let bygones be bygones. And if somebody did you dirty, either move on and let it go or remove that person from your life and no longer associate with them. Maybe you can share some of your knowledge and experience. Offer some guidance to younger guys that are just starting out with something that you have experience in. Volunteer, donate time, resources, or any experience to things that you actually care about because I'm telling you helping others is just a great reminder that life isn't just about you and that's a good thing. Define your purpose and your goals. What does success actually look like for you? And if you don't know, now's the time to try to figure that out. Try to reflect on what matters most to you. Set some meaningful goals, both big and small, and then develop a plan of attack. You can also break up those goals into some smaller steps so you can start seeing progress soon. None of this is rocket science, my friends. So start small, stay consistent, and remember, it's not that hard. You got this. One last thing, gentlemen. Don't forget to hit the link down in the description to score a great deal on a great skincare kit. And, as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well, and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " At the beginning of every single year, I take all my video projects from their previous year and I transfer everything over from my working local store's drives to these little archive drives. And I've been doing it this way since about 2019. I basically have copies of every single video I've ever done. So anyway, I started going through some of my really old stuff from my blog website years ago before I started my YouTube channel. And it's crazy to look back at where I started from. I mean, styles change and everything. But back then, I was still learning. I was just getting into the stuff back in about 2014. And I tried literally everything. And sometimes I tried everything all at the same time. And I made a lot of mistakes. And that's what inspired today's video, right? We all start at the beginning. And it's just one of those things where you just don't know what you know. And back then, I didn't know I was making mistakes because I simply didn't know. But I was trying and I was learning. So today, I want to give you a bit of a jumpstart and help you skip past some of those embarrassing moments and growing pains that you might experience when you're first getting started on your style journey. These are all things that sort of popped into my head initially. So if you have anything to add to this video, please feel free to leave some comments down below and we'll get like a secondary list going. Something I did a lot of, unfortunately, was I would wear a really nice suit jacket with blue jeans. I thought at the time it was kind of like wearing a suit jacket like I would wear a sports jacket. Now, sometimes you can get away with this depending on the suit and the material. But I was wearing like really nice charcoal gray suit jackets and also some really nice navy blue suit jackets. And these were like nicer fabrics that had a little bit of sheen to it. So you could tell right away that it was a suit jacket, not a sports jacket. There is a difference. So when I look back at some of those old photos, it just it just automatically looks off. There's this too big of a contrast in formality. If you want to go with a jacket and jeans look, just do a standard sports jacket. One other thing with suit and sports jackets is when you buy them, you need to cut the tack stitch off the vents in the back and also cut open the breast pocket in the front and also remove any labels that might be on the sleeve cuff. Depending on where you buy it, sometimes that stitch will already be removed. But look, nine times out of 10 when you buy a new suit or sports jacket, the vents in the back are going to be sewn closed with a tiny little tack stitch. It should be a contrasting color so you can see it. You need to cut off that thread so the jacket vents can open and move around as you walk around and sit down. Now something else to pay attention to is not only matching your belt color to your shoe color, but also trying to match the material. Here's what I mean. So this is a really nice pair of brown hole cut dress shoes. And you would probably agree this is a pretty nice pair of shoes. Now, I would not wear this belt with these shoes. Now technically, the color is a close match, but the bigger issue is the formality of this belt itself. This is basically a casual belt. It's a lot wider and has some of that contrasting stitching. And I probably wear this with a pair of boots. Now this belt, though, on the other hand, is a closer match in color. And it's also a closer match in formality. It's a lot thinner and it's got a more formal appearance. And here's the thing. Most guys own two belts, a black one and a brown one. And they're both typically casual. But what about a dress belt? Because as you just saw, the casual belt doesn't really match. And also, what about light brown and dark brown? Anson Belt is sponsoring today's video. And these are basically the only belts that I wear anymore. They're super good looking. They're amazing quality. The fit is always perfect. The buckles are all interchangeable. And they've got colors and styles to match just about any outfit and any shoe. And one of the coolest things about Anson Belt is never having to worry about a bad fit. All of their belts are designed with this little micro adjustment that always gives you a perfect fit. Now, traditional belts have holes spaced out like one inch apart. And they just never, ever seem to be in the right place. But these micro adjustments are spaced out a quarter inch apart. So even if your waistline fluctuates, you always have a perfect fit. Anson Belts are affordable. They always look absolutely terrific. And of course, they're functional because they're adjustable. They also have a ton of different styles, colors, and materials that you can choose from on their website. The straps come in leather, canvas, nylon, cloth, and microsweight as well as vegan and some other premium limited edition materials. There are literally thousands of combinations to choose from. And in my opinion, these are the best belts on the planet. Guys, click that link down below in the description for the best offer going right now. Now, whether you're purchasing just one belt and buckle like this or take an advantage of the best offer, and that's their box set where you get to choose the straps and the buckles. Go hit that link down below and find exactly what you're looking for. All right, one more thing that has to do with contrast in formality, and it's wearing shiny black dress shoes with jeans or really any shiny dress shoe with jeans. Now, I have done this in the past thinking that I was making like this really bold style move, but it just doesn't work because the more elevated and formal the shoe is, the more everything else needs to be on par with that level of formality because wearing a formal shoe like this with a pair of blue jeans just doesn't work. You could however get away with doing something like this shoe because it's a more casual shoe. Here's another lesson that I had to learn the hard way because I did this once, only once, and I got corrected by somebody at this event that I was at and it was super embarrassing, and it's making sure that you have your cuff links on correctly and not backwards. So back when I used to work weddings a few years ago, I had to help a lot of guys with this one. Now, here's the deal. Most all cuff links have a front and a back, and the front should be facing the outside of your wrist when your arms are hanging down at your side. So when you're putting your cuff links on, start from the outside and work the latch through to the inside. Okay, here comes another one, and it's wearing your button-up dress shirt untucked when you're wearing dress pants or slacks. That is a no-go. I get it though, right, because we all like to wear our shirts untucked because it's cool and casual, but once you put on a nice pair of trousers or slacks, it changes the game. At that point, your shirt should be tucked in. Jeans and chinos, that's 50-50. Do whatever you want. All right, next is wearing sneakers with a suit. So this trend came along a little bit later, and I think I've only tried this exactly once, and I just didn't like it. I would recommend leaving this for the younger guys. I mean, if you're 26, go for it, but if you're 46 or 56, it just doesn't come off the same way. Here's something else to pay close attention to. If you are wearing a collar shirt underneath a sweater or some kind of a pullover, make sure that the collar points of your shirt stay inside your sweater. If you want to let the collar points fly, you can do whatever you want, and that's a style choice, but once again, I would leave that to the younger guys. Now, one thing I would do to make sure that my collar points stay where I wanted to stay is to just wear a button-down collar shirt. Now, here's a couple of suggestions when you're wearing a tie. First of all, make sure that the length of your tie hits right about in the middle of your belt buckle. Anything too long looks funny, and everything too short looks funny. And yes, I do know it can be a huge pain in the ass. Rewind your tie five times to make sure you got the length right, but you got to do it. Another one is wearing those matching tie and pocket square sets. Don't do that. Now, you can wear a pocket square that has similar colors as your tie, but having those two items match exactly just tells the world that you have no idea how to dress up. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. The next lesson I learned the hard way was matching your sock color to your pants. Now, this is more important when you're dressed up a bit, but if you ever question what color your sock should be, just closely match them to whatever pants you're wearing. Now, if you're wearing a navy suit with maybe a burgundy tie, a lot of people might choose a burgundy pair of socks, and that's fine. There's always going to be those exceptions, but if you're ever not sure, match your socks to your pants. So like I mentioned at the beginning of this video, if I left anything out, please comment down below so we can get another list going. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well, and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Let's chat briefly here about AI and where I see AI going in terms of social media and YouTube. And because YouTube is what I do for a living almost every single day, I have some thoughts and opinions. So all right, I was having a chat this morning in the gym with my trainer. And we were talking about the use of AI in YouTube, Instagram, and also TikTok. Now he's a younger guy, and he was talking about basically the oversaturation of AI generated content, and that he feels audiences are moving away from it. Now we talked about it for a couple of minutes, and here's my take. So I guess for about the last eight months to a year now, there seems to be this big push for faceless social media accounts like YouTube and TikTok. Basically, the idea is that you can give chat GPT a topic, and then have it write you a script, then you import that script into a voice generator. And now you have this voiceover for your video, then you use another AI generator to create visuals that run throughout the video. Now, as you can probably see here, the ability to pump out lots of content is pretty good. But there is just a whole lot missing. I mean, first of all, there's a lack of authenticity, right? Because AI generated content doesn't have the human connection, personality, or emotion that you would get from real people. Now, yes, I do watch my own videos, and I do know that sometimes I can be a little dry and I can ramble quite a bit. But look, for the most part, I think I deliver a pretty solid message. And I believe I connect with a big part of this audience. I mean, I'm a human being, right? And I've got my own unique personality, quirks, and opinions. You just don't get that with AI. Now, something else that happens with AI content is because AI needs to rely on existing data and also patterns, some of that content can seem overly formulated, I guess, and that can be sort of boring to watch. I'm also seeing a lot of similar looking and also similar sounding videos, which once again, just completely loses the human connection. Now, most of the time when we see AI generated videos, we can pretty much tell right away that it's not a human that's delivering the message. So then the question about misinformation comes up because AI can and does unintentionally deliver misinformation. Now, something else that I'm seeing personally is the oversaturation of AI content. AI is an amazing tool, but it just hasn't reached the point yet where it's become indistinguishable from humans. Now, a lot of these guys are using the same AI voice. So now you've got like 100 different YouTube channels and social media accounts that all use the same exact voice. If you want to like learn something or follow a recipe or be motivated, sure, AI can work pretty well in that situation. But real people that tell stories with emotion is what makes content a lot more memorable and also engaging for the audience. You just don't get that with AI because there's just no personal connection. So for example, if you see me out somewhere in public, you could come over and say hi. It happens from time to time, and it's always amazing. But who's the person behind your favorite AI videos? Do they live in your same town or do they live on the other side of the planet? And that's where some of the trust issues come in because there's just no accountability for the content. Now, I have seen a lot of these AI videos in the men's style space, and they're all kind of predictable. And I also get sort of bored watching them because I know that it's coming from this AI source. And I also know that AI is still learning. And what it knows now is just coming from data that's already out there. It's not someone's individual opinion or idea. So for me, in full disclosure, I do use AI from time to time to help me research certain topics or come up with video topic ideas, video titles, or topics based around a certain idea that I gave it. It's sort of similar to just jumping on Google and researching some topic. But AI does a really good job of consolidating the idea into something that's easy to digest versus Google where I've got to read 100 different articles. So my prediction is this because I'm already starting to see it. Audience members and communities of people want to engage with other people, not AI. And because it's still pretty easily distinguishable as AI, the message comes across as less authentic. So people are tuning out of those videos. And those types of channels aren't going to do very well going forward. Now let's talk short content because that's also getting way oversaturated. And I can see the pushback towards longer form YouTube videos like this. Now short form content might always have its place. But I'm telling you everybody is abusing it right now and they're trying to work the algorithm. Here's what I mean. All right, here is a perfect example. So bear with me for the next couple of seconds. You guys, I have been doing five things every single day that has absolutely transformed my life for the better. And just for reference, my name is John and I've been a behavioral psychologist for the last two decades. I have taught a lot of my clients these five things and they have seen incredible transformative results. These five things are so easy to do that anybody could do it. And it all starts with one simple strategy. As soon as you learn the strategy, I'm about to tell you implementing these five things into your life will be an absolute game changer. And you'll wonder why you didn't do this before. Like and subscribe for part two. See what I mean? So look, here's the thing. It's all about viewership retention that helps feed the algorithm because the longer you stay on one of those videos, the more the algorithm considers that a valuable video and then it pushes it out to more people because you watched all the way to the end. The problem is it's all a strategy from the creator to get you to stay on the video all the way through. They're delivering absolutely zero value, but they're getting the benefits of you watching the entire thing. So they get the benefits of the algorithm. AI is good at a lot of things and it's only going to get better and better. In my opinion, it's fascinating and it's a little bit scary, but it's coming and there's not much anybody can do about it other than just to sit back and watch what happens. So again, until AI gets to a point where it's indistinguishable as a human being on your screen, I don't see it advancing too much on social media. Human beings want human interaction, so I don't see these faceless YouTube channels doing very well going forward. And with all of that said, I could be completely wrong, but that's my take on it. But I'm also really curious what your thoughts are. So please let me know your thoughts down below in the comment section. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " In 2023, I made more money than I've ever made my entire life. Making a list of goals is just like making a list of wants. What is your strategy and what is your first step? And I guess I've also played around with the idea of moving out of California, just your job, and your responsibility to deal with any past trauma and communicate any insecurities so that you don't bring it into the new relationship and end up bleeding on the person who didn't cut you. For the last couple of years now, around this time, I've made videos talking about my goals for the new year. I've also made some videos kind of sprinkled in throughout the year where I've talked about adjusting those goals depending on sort of how you're doing. Now this year, I was going back and looking at my initial goal list from the first part of 2024, and I noticed I didn't reach a lot of those goals. Now I did some, but most of them I didn't. And in some ways, it's very disappointing and it does sort of piss me off a little bit, but in other ways, I have to realize that there's things that are just out of my control. But I also realized that some of those things were in my control, but I just didn't have a good enough plan. And here's sort of how you have to look at things. Making a list of goals is just like making a list of wants, right? You could want something really badly, but sometimes it's just not enough. For example, maybe you have a goal of losing 40 pounds. So essentially what that means is that you want to lose 40 pounds. Okay, and that's great. How are you going to do it? What is your strategy and what is your first step? Because look, wanting to achieve something is totally fine and it's good to have those wants. But without having some kind of plan of attack, it's just setting yourself up for failure. And I know that firsthand. And that's also where the readjusting along the way comes in, because initially, you might not know everything that you need to do to be able to lose that 40 pounds. But as you start going along and educate yourself a little more along the way, you'll learn more new strategies that can help you get there and then you readjust. So if you're making a resolution list or a goal list for this year, first of all, that's great. I think we should all have something that we're working towards. I would though encourage you to think about some ways that you can actually reach those goals, right? Again, having goals is good, but having goals with strategy is even better. All right, so let me share just a few of my goals for this new year, along with some of the strategies to help me get there. Now, first, improving my overall health and fitness. That was one of my goals for last year, and that's been one of my successes. So my goal at the beginning of 2024 was to work on my overall fitness, and that strategy that I had at that time was to hire a personal trainer. And that's exactly what I did, and I've stuck with it the entire year. And this year is basically just more of the same. Now, most of you already know that I'm 55 years old. And at this point, look, if you don't use it, you lose it. And I've come to realize that my quality of life is way more important than just a couple hours of torture in the gym. And the payoff from working out is long-term quality of life, mobility, strength, and of course, looking better physically. Another one is dialing in my supplementation. I've talked about this a few times, but if you don't already know, I'm a pretty big vitamin guy because it's almost impossible to get all the vitamins and nutrients that I need just by eating a regular, clean diet. Now, I'm going to show you every single vitamin I take and why it's important in an upcoming video, because this video would end up being just way too long. But I do want to talk about something I just added back in December to my supplement routine. These are grooms. Now, this is a super convenient, comprehensive formula that's packed into eight gummies per day. Now, this isn't just a multivitamin or just a greens gummy or just a probiotic. It's basically all of those things and more at a fraction of the price. And the bonus is they taste amazing. So here's the deal. Eight of these delicious gummies are included in each daily pack because you could not fit the amount of nutrients they do in just like one of these gummies. And here's the other thing. Generic multivitamins only contain around seven or so vitamins. These have over 20 vitamins and minerals and more than 60 whole food ingredients. There's no artificial colors or flavors and they really do taste absolutely amazing. And just that right there sort of blows my mind because these are sugar-free, vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and also dairy-free. And I really don't know how they make it taste so good because they're all good ingredients, but it feels like you're having just a sweet snack every day. I love what these guys are doing because grooms is more comprehensive and it's also more accurately dosed than what you might currently be doing. Just check the label. Grooms contains 100% of your daily needs for safe vitamins. And not every supplement, vitamin or greens powder out there, puts in the care-to-dose ingredients as effectively as grooms does. Here's another benefit. Grooms is more bioavailable, which means the ability for it to be absorbed and used by your body is greater. And I could go on about this all day, but a few more benefits are gut health, immunity, recovery, and cognition. Grooms has six times the gut health ingredients compared to other greens powders. It contains biotin and niacinamide, which results in thicker hair, nails, and healthier skin. It also has specific mushroom ingredients, which helps brain function and brain fog. And of course, good old vitamin C that helps increase your immunity during the cold and flu season. The bottom line is, as a vitamin guy myself, I'm excited to add this to my routine. And right now, for a limited time, you can start the new year off right and get up to 52, yes, 52% off using the link down below in the description. That is an incredible savings on an incredible product. Thank you, Grooms, for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, another goal that I have is to save money and buy a house probably next year. Now, I've owned a few houses in my lifetime, but I've been renting for, I guess, about the last nine years or so. And in some ways, I like the flexibility of renting because I'm able to be somewhat nimble. And I guess I've also played around with the idea of moving out of California a couple times, but I've just fallen in love with this area and I can totally see myself buying a place here. It's a really cool part of the world. Now, I do have a dollar amount in mind that I want to save by the end of the year. And one of my initial strategies is setting up something like a high yield savings or maybe even a Vanguard account that just sort of runs itself in the background. And it takes automatic deposits, so I just don't even have to think about it. And along with stacking up some money this year, another goal of mine is cutting my expenses and living a little more simply. Here's the truth. In 2023, I made more money than I've ever made in my entire life. And the few years leading up to that, it was a really steady ratchet upwards every single year. And every year I made more and more and there was really no indication of it ever slowing. Well, the second half of 2024 kind of smacked me in the face a little bit because revenue was just way down and it forced me to make some changes. Changes for the better in a lot of ways. I mean, I'm still fine, but things needed to change. And I've already made a lot of those changes and that's all part of the new strategy. Another one of my big goals for this year is to focus on growing the new wine business. I haven't launched yet and that's been really challenging for me because the goal was to launch over the holidays. But like I mentioned in my last wine update video, there's just a lot of moving parts and a lot of things that are just out of my control. Now, I can let it get me really frustrated and angry, but that's not serving me or helping me stay positive and helping me stay excited for the launch. I mean, I'm still very excited because I know how good the wine is. I know the quality of the fruit. I know I've got a good story behind the brand and I know I'm doing it for all the right reasons. And as soon as I have a significant news update, trust me, you'll be the first to know. Another personal goal of mine this year is to be more selfish when it comes to the women that I allow into my life. It's been kind of a weird year. I've had a few different relationships and I also went through kind of a difficult breakup. I mean, look, man, I have a very strong understanding of who I am and the value that I'm able to bring into a relationship. I know what I'm looking for. I know how to treat women very well. And I also know how I need to be treated. I also have very clear boundaries and I'm aware of those behaviors that I'm no longer willing to accept from people. And look, I also understand that the older we all get, the more baggage that we have. I totally get that. But what I don't do is play games. And if I chance you're a woman who's watching this or even a guy who's watching this, it's your job to be ready for a relationship. It's your job and your responsibility to deal with any past trauma and communicate any insecurities so that you don't bring it into the new relationship and end up bleeding on the person who didn't cut you. Because anyone with any measure of emotional intelligence and self-worth simply won't put up with it. Again, it's your job to deal with your issues and move past it so that you're actually ready to be with someone who is healthy. Because otherwise, it's a big waste of time. And if your mid-40s are older, I mean, the clock is ticking and healthy people don't have time for it. And with that, my friends, I hope you have an amazing 2025. And I want to thank each and every one of you for your ongoing support. I appreciate you more than you might even be able to imagine. Thank you so much for watching. Live well, and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Today, I want to try to motivate and remind you about a few things. So sitting here as a dude in my 50s, I'm telling you that your 40s can be some of the best years of your life. I mean, you're old enough to have some wisdom, but you're still young enough to be able to have some amazing new adventures. Use this time to invest in yourself.ize your health, your passions, and your relationships. And don't let anybody else dictate how you should live your life. You define your path. Nobody else does. All right, so we're just a few days into the new year. So let's talk about it. 2024 for me was awesome in a lot of ways, but also pretty terrible in a lot of ways. I did some pretty cool things and I met some really cool people. And I also had a significant amount of hardship. One thing that I can say without any reservation 2025 for me will be more about prioritizing and protecting my health, my bank account, and my heart. Okay, here's where the reminders start happening. So this year, let go of the fear of failure, regret, and any anxiety of what might be coming next. Focus on growth, connection, and kindness because that's going to help you live a more amazing life in this coming year. Also learn from the past. One of the most powerful tools in self-improvement is hindsight. Setbacks are going to be inevitable, but when we face setbacks, it gets kind of easy to feel really defeated. But those experiences are what shape you into a better and stronger individual. Take a minute to reflect on this past year and then ask yourself, what went wrong? What did I learn? And how can I do better? Because failure isn't the end. It's just a stepping stone. And if you felt the heartbreak of loss this year, this past year, like I did, whether it's the loss of a relationship or a really big opportunity or a loved one, allow yourself time to grieve. Feeling pain is just part of being human and it's totally okay to feel some of those emotions. But just don't let it consume you and keep you from moving forward. Channel the pain into motivation and turn your loss into a reason to live better and love deeper. For example, when relationships fail, it's natural to feel sadness, anger, and regret. But instead of looking at those experiences as just only negative experiences, try to see them as opportunities for some growth. And then ask yourself, what role you played in the relationship and where it all ended up? What are some of the areas that you could have done a little bit better? Did you set healthy boundaries? Did you choose to stay in that relationship out of just convenience or the fear of being alone again? I'm telling you, learning from relationship failures means taking responsibility for your part of that expired relationship. Just watch the negative self-talk and don't beat yourself up too badly because if you wouldn't say it to your mother, you don't get to say it to yourself. Recognize some of the patterns that led you to where you are right now and then commit to healthier patterns going forward. Now we're just coming out of the holiday season and that can be a really weird time of year especially if you're not where you want to be in life or you're not where you think you should be at this point in your life. So here's a message that I want to get across. If you have a lot going on in your head, I want you to reach out to the service that I believe in, BetterHelp, today's sponsor. BetterHelp is a platform where therapists and their clients can communicate effectively and get the most out of therapy. And here's the thing about therapy. First of all, there's no shame in it at all. And second of all, it's one of those things that you don't know how much it can really help until you actually try it. BetterHelp is on a mission to make starting therapy a lot easier and with over 7,000 reviews and a 4.5 star rating on TrustPilot, BetterHelp is a platform you can trust. I'm going to put a link down below in the video description box to betterhelp.com slash fashion. Clicking on that link will get you 10% off your first month of BetterHelp so that you can connect with a therapist and get started on your very own therapy journey and see if it's something that you can benefit from. All you do is fill out a quick questionnaire about what you're looking for and then BetterHelp will match you with a therapist in as little as just a few days. From there, you can talk to your therapist however you feel comfortable. It could be messaging or phone or even video calls. And you can message your therapist at any time in schedule, live sessions, whenever it's convenient for you. And the really cool thing is if you don't necessarily click with that first therapist for whatever reason, which can sort of be common when you're first getting started, you can easily switch out to a brand new therapist until you find someone that you can really connect with. So gentlemen, if you could use a tune up to get some of your questions answered right now, please consider online therapy with BetterHelp. Just click the link in the description or go visit betterhelp.com slash fashion to get 10% off your first month of therapy. The link is down below. Thank you BetterHelp for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, here's another one. Learn from your financial failures. Financial setbacks can feel absolutely overwhelming, but they can also be some of your most valuable teaching moments. Maybe it was a bad investment or excessive spending or maybe just not planning for things that are unexpected. That can all sort of show you how you handle money and make those decisions. So this year, commit to financial growth by setting some very clear goals. Maybe it's paying off some credit card debt or building up your emergency fund. Make some clear goals and stick to it. Learn from those mistakes and make smarter choices going forward. Here's something else though. You need to set realistic goals. I mean, way too many people fall on the trap of setting these just crazy ambitious goals and that ends up getting overwhelming really fast and everything crashes down. This year, try focusing on setting realistic and achievable goals that improve your life both personally and professionally. Start small. For example, if you want to get healthier, commit to walking 10 minutes a day. If you want to advance your career, set a clear goal to learn one new skill by like June, mid-year. Also understand that it's not about setting the actual goal, but it's also about having a plan of how you're going to achieve that goal because you just can't say you want to lose 50 pounds this year without some type of strategy on how you're going to do that. Now this one is a big one and I talk about it all the time, but it's expanding your horizons. In my opinion, a life that's fulfilling is a life that's full of experiences. This year, make it a priority to get out and just do more. Explore some new hobbies. Maybe visit places that you've never been to. Maybe try some new activities that challenge you. Maybe it's hiking or skiing or salsa dancing, painting or maybe learning a new language. But if you're someone who really doesn't feel comfortable going out by yourself so you stay home a lot, challenge yourself to one night a week. Try a new restaurant every week and sit at the bar if you can and be open to conversation. Maybe find some live music this Saturday night and go check it out. Maybe there's a swanky cocktail lounge or a wine bar in your area that you've never been to before. Maybe get dressed up a little bit and go treat yourself. This one might be my favorite and I think it's a really good reminder and it's practicing kindness. One of, I'm telling you, the simplest and most impactful ways to improve your own self-esteem is by being kind to other people without expecting anything in return. It's easy. Just hold the door open for people. Compliment somebody on their work, their sense of style or maybe something they said. Acts of kindness are just an easy way to make someone else's day better, but in the process it makes your day better too. And I'm sort of curious, if you have anything to add to this video, please let me know down below in the comment section. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be the last Q&A of 2024. I really like doing these, right? I do them every couple of months and I really do enjoy doing these and answering your questions. Sometimes the questions can be a little salacious. I don't necessarily mind that, but sometimes they just don't make it into the video for obvious reasons. But those are definitely entertaining. First things first though, I want to give you a quick update on a video that's coming soon. The video I made about how to impress your date, your girlfriend, a new date, even your wife you've had for 20 years. And in that video, I talked about a method that I use walking through a door to a restaurant or to an establishment. And I explained that I go first, open the door and she comes next to me. That's hard to visualize. I get it. So a lot of you, a ton of you wanted a part two video with more visuals. So I'm going to make that video at some point in January. So in a couple of weeks, you will see that part two video and I'm going to show more of what I explained in the first video. So stay tuned for that. But let's dive into the first question. What catches your attention about a woman besides the obvious? I think if we're talking about catching my attention and I'm just going to speak for me in terms of attractiveness, it is the obvious. It is on the surface how you look, right? Because that's kind of your first impression. It's also for me how she carries herself, how she's dressed. I'm a style guy. I do pay attention to that. Even though I don't fully understand all of the women's rules when it comes to fashion. But it's also elegance and poise and manners and how you carry yourself. All of those things, I mean, you can't always judge that or see that from across the room how she treats her friends or how she speaks. But you can notice, you can tell poise and elegance. I don't know what that is, but you can definitely see it. And that right there, that's something that I look for. That will definitely catch my attention. And that's a great segue into the next question. Do you have a new girlfriend? At the moment, no, I don't. I'm not going to linger on this too long. I had been seeing someone for the last couple of months and it's a timing thing and a boundaries thing and I'm not going to go all deep into it or linger on this. But the answer, great lady, it's just a timing thing. So the answer is no, I'm not seeing anyone. Now there was a whole lot of questions that came in about this next one and I'm going to make a video talking more about the reasons why I made that decision and made that change. Anyway, what I've got, I'm leasing this one. It's a 2025 BMW 430i with all the M Sport stuff. It's basically a fully loaded 430i. Two-door coupe. I like it. It's very cool. I don't compare at all to the Corvette, completely different vehicles, but I like it. It's cool and I'm saving a lot of money and that's kind of the reason why I did what I did. I'm at a point in my life and I'll talk more about this in the dedicated car video. I need to make a change. I want to make a change. I want to buy a house. I want to stack up money. I want to buy something. I need to buy a house. I'm renting a house. I need more in my life right now than what I'm doing. I live a fantastic lifestyle. I really do. But there's some things that are missing and I'm in the mode now to sort of work on higher level stuff if that makes any sense. Anyway, yeah, so it's a BMW. The Corvette is gone. This is a fantastic question because there's a lot of nuances here. How do I finally figure out my personal style? In a nutshell, experimentation, who are you? What's your lifestyle? What do you do for work? If you're blue collar, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to run around wearing suits and slacks and dress shoes on the weekends. Maybe it does for you. I don't know. Experimentation. See things. Actively look for men's fashion items. Look at men's fashion videos. Look at men's fashion Pinterest accounts or Google images or Instagram accounts and look at what people are doing. Pay attention. So look what people are doing and see if you like any of those things. Then you can implement that for yourself. Just be careful not to put too much importance on trends and following trends of the 25-year-old, 26-year-old guys that you might find on Google and Instagram. Find some other accounts that are doing more mature stuff and see what you like if you find somebody wearing ASCOS all the time. If that's not your thing, that's not going to be very helpful. What do you gravitate towards? What colors do you like? What styles do you like? Because at this point, you should have an idea of things that you like and pieces that you like. You can figure out your own personal style based on things that you already like and almost maybe things that you already wear. But if you want to make a change, you have to experiment. You've got to try stuff. You've got to go get a piece and wear it and see how you like it, how you can sort of pair it up with something else that you might already have. It's just trial and error. I still experiment even today. So you'll be just fine. I can tell by the reason you asked the question or because you asked me the question, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Is there a color or colors that you steer clear of? Yeah. It's interesting. Bright colors, like bright red, bright yellow, bright orange, bright greens. This doesn't really work for me. I don't gravitate towards those colors and I don't think I look good in really bright colors. The other ones I'm finding recently some pastels like light blue, light green, and gray. Gray also. Lighter tones, I don't know. I just don't really look good when I see myself on video or in pictures wearing lighter color pastel color tops, especially in the summertime. It's warm here. It just, yeah, it kind of washes me out a little bit. And I've even worn stuff on camera in videos and have you guys even say, like, don't wear that color anymore, dude, it washes you out. So I'm paying attention to that a little bit. So I wear darks a lot. I'm wearing a lot of black right now. It's so crazy. Black and navy blue, dark brown. I'm just finding myself wearing a lot of dark colors. I think it just kind of works for me. Maybe it's the hair color. I don't know. I think that just sort of works for me. But yeah, I stay away from the bright colors and some of the pastels. Best cologne you own. I don't know about best. I have my favorites. I've got 20-something bottles of cologne in there. And I think my favorites move around a little bit depending on the weather and the time of season. Right now being that it's winter and it's kind of dark and cold, what I'm gravitating towards the most is Tom Ford Black Orchid. This is the new one. The previous one, I think, came in a black bottle. This is in the gold bottle. This works so good, especially in the evenings. So I go out quite a bit. I'm out all the time. And I'll run into people that I know and you give them a hug. You know, good to see you. And I get like, oh my god, what are you wearing? That smells so good. So lots of compliments. It has staying power. Projection isn't amazing, but it's not. I don't want it to like go across the room, right? I want it to stay right about here, like a foot or two. And that's what this does. It's good. It lasts long. If you haven't tried it, try it. Sort of interesting question. So can we style formal shirt with dark denim blue jeans as tuck in style with matching accessories? Yes. I think what you're asking me is can you wear like a dress shirt with dark denim blue jeans and then match your accessories? Of course. Absolutely. Personally, I would do brown shoes or brown boots with the brown belt that matches. What I would do and what I do quite a bit is I will do a dark denim on my lower half and then I'll do like a navy blue shirt tucked in, dress shirt tucked in. I might roll up the sleeves a little bit depending on what's going on. I can also do a black sweater, brown sweater, gray sweater, those types of things. So yeah, dude, you can do anything you want. What do you think about dress sneakers from Cole Hawn, Johnson and Murphy? I have sort of mixed feelings about those. I think there's definitely a market. There's a huge market for a product like that. Going back to the car thing, I'm at the car dealership and my sales guy is walking back and forth and all around and we were talking about like, oh, he was asking me what I do for a living and told him and he goes, oh, that's interesting. And he immediately pointed at his shoes and went, like, I know these aren't the most stylish, but I'm on my feet all day long. So they have to look sort of nice, but also be extremely comfortable. So I get it. And he was wearing one of those dress sneaker styles. I 100% get it. There's a lot of guys that need a shoe like that. So for those guys, it's a fantastic option. Do I think it's the most stylish? No, not even close. See, this is where I get a little, I don't know what the right answer is. For me personally, I don't wear them. I don't have a need for it. I'm not on my feet all the time. And I have comfortable dress shoes and boots anyway, so I don't really need a shoe like that. But there's a market for it. I just don't think they're super stylish personally. Buelleton is my favorite town. Have you been to the Hitching Post or Brewery's there yet? Have not been to the Hitching Post. I've been through Buelleton half a dozen times. I've been in Buelleton. Actually, I've stayed in Solvang, not Buelleton. But I've only been in Buelleton once. And it was probably two months ago when I went with my buddy Vito up to the wine facility and dropped off a bunch of grapes. And we went, I don't know, I forget what it was. It was a Brewery, but it was also like a restaurant kind of thing. But it was really sort of communal and there was like picnic tables inside. Cool spot, pretty cool town. But yeah, haven't been to the Hitching Post. I think I need to. How old are you? I'm 55. It looks like this one's coming from my trip up to Seattle during the Thanksgiving week. I was there for seven days and I was posting on Instagram and he's asking, you visited some great places. How much family do you have here in the Puget Sound? So I've got both sides of my family, mom's side, dad's side, in Washington state. My mom's side is in Western Washington and my dad's side is in Eastern Washington. But yeah, it was kind of a cool, it was a cool trip. We did three days in downtown Bellevue and then we did, no, I'm sorry, let me back up, two days in downtown Bellevue with the Hyatt. Then we went to Paul's bow to hang out with my mom and her husband for Thanksgiving. That was super great. And then we did three nights at the end of the trip back in Kirkland. So we sort of bounced around a little bit, mostly East side. It didn't go into downtown Seattle at all. I didn't want to deal with the holiday traffic and getting in and out of Seattle can be kind of a pain in the butt. But yeah, what else was really cool is that when I was a few days before I was leaving to go, I hit up a few buddies that I haven't seen in probably close to 10 years. And I'm like, hey man, I'm going to be in town. I know it's kind of late notice, but I'd love to see you and catch up, grab a drink, lunch, whatever, whatever's convenient for you. And both of them were like, fuck yeah. I didn't get the, I'll see if I can make it work. I don't know. I've got stuff going on maybe next time. I got hell yeah, like when and where. And that was so cool. That was so cool. I saw my buddy Zach. He's doing amazing. I saw my buddy Nash. I went to see his new house he just built. He's been in it for like eight months or something. The house is unbelievable. We were there at night. I couldn't really take any pictures, but he's, what do you say, five acres of like beach front, waterfront over in Palsbow. He can see Bainbridge Island out his back window. Spectacular place, amazing place. And all in all, it was a very nice trip. How about showing coats? Jackets don't work for us in the cold weather areas. I totally, I totally get that 100%. Here's the thing that makes it a little challenging for me. I don't have a whole lot of coats. I live in Southern California. The content that I try to make and the videos I try to put out sort of fit in the middle of like most people and I get it. And I say this when I make videos like that, where, you know, if you live in a really cold area, this might not apply to you or on the flip side, I get the same kind of questions from guys that live in the Philippines. It's super hot here. What do I wear that's stylish for this extreme humidity that we have? I will answer those questions individually, but again, it's like, I have to try to make but I'm not, I'm not apologizing. I'm just saying that I have to make videos that will reach the greatest number of people that will help the most amount of people. If I narrow that down, no one's going to watch. Here's an example. What to wear in extreme humidity? Well, if I don't live where it's super humid, I'm not going to watch that video. The goal is to get eyeballs on what I'm doing. It's hard to make something that's going to make everyone happy. Here's another one. Hats. I've never made a video about hats, but I constantly get asked to make videos about hats. I don't wear hats. I don't necessarily like hats on myself. I don't know anything about hats. Same thing with sort of Western wear. And I've said this before, I don't know the Western wear market. I sort of stay in my lane and I do what I know and that seems to work out best because if I made a video about hats or cowboy boots, you would see right through it and you would know that I'm faking it just to try to get views. And I don't want to do that. Are aviator style eyeglasses fashionable in your opinion? Of course they are. I've got no problem at all. And also, Phil sent me in a selfie of himself and I didn't ask him permission to put it in the video. So, I'm not going to put it here, but dude, they look fantastic. No issues at all. I think that's going to do it for this Q&A, but I do have a favor. If you wouldn't mind, check on your single friends right now. I mean, it's almost Christmas. And I posted something about this on my Instagram yesterday. The holidays are very, very fun and merry and celebratory and festive. There's a lot of people that you might know that don't have anything to do on Christmas or even New Year's. So, just check on them. How you doing? Call. Take them out to grab a beer or something. Do something, but check on your single friends. They'll get a lot out of it and so will you. And I think that's going to do it for this Q&A, the last Q&A of 2024. Thank you to everyone who's sending your questions. I appreciate it. I love doing these videos from time to time. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy New Year if I don't see you before then. And enjoy yourself. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " You clicked on this video and I just want to say thank you very much. It's sort of interesting my last Few videos that I've made about the new wine business haven't done very well in terms of views, but I don't I Understand I get it right you're here for the lifestyle stuff and the fashion advice totally understand the wine thing is something that is a passion project and There's a story behind it. So if you didn't see the video that I made Talking about why I'm doing this and why I'm starting this I'll link it down below You can go see that one after you watch this once this video is gonna be an update. I Think I was going through I think my last video that I made a While ago, maybe a month or more ago where I was talking about the wine business and Kind of where I was at and I would taste it through all the different varietals And I landed on four different wines that I'm gonna launch with I I mentioned in that video that I was hoping to launch by Thanksgiving Right now it is December 17th. So that didn't happen Realistically now at this point And I'll get into some of this stuff without making this video very long. It's it's gonna be January There's there's so many moving parts and also There's a lot of things that are can just completely out of my control So if things were more in my control, I would be making shit happen But since I can't I can't do it's out of my control. I mean one of the things is the state of California I'm dealing with cola which is the certification of label approval, which I'll show you some labels here in just a second These are all preliminary Not the final design, but that takes three or four weeks to get through the state for approval We're building out the website Anyway, anyway, let me give you a little bit of a like what's been happening since the last time we talk All right, so the reason I have Two wine bottles in front of me. Let me just get this out of the way and show you guys So this is the seven yon block and by the way, these labels are not final They're changing completely and this is the Pinot Noir both fantastic absolutely Absolutely delicious. You're going to love them. So I did I got invited to do this charity event through a buddy of mine He's he's an attorney. He's helping me do a lot of legal stuff and which has been amazing by the way Andy Thank you very much. So Andy invited me to do this military fundraiser for I believe it was veterans who need legal assistance and anyway, it was a fundraiser for that Block tie it was amazing had such a good time And my function was a table set up with with these two wines that I could just pour for free for people It was phenomenal. It was so cool. I had I was in my element completely I'm like Complimenting all the women on how they dress and how they look and the guys looked so nice and it was it was really It was just fun. I know that sounds a little bit weird, but it was really It's a good time I like being in that environment where I can sort of put on a little bit of his show and get people excited and Tell the story a little bit And it's funny, you know, you can read the crowd and some people just you know I want my free glass of wine and gonna walk away. That's fine other people were like well Who are you? What is this about? And so I tell the story about my brother passing away when I was 15 years old of suicide And this is a way to bring his name back to life and it was so Interesting how many people had similar stories in their family or you know, someone close to them that they know And it was really cool. So I connected with a lot of people People wanted me to people wanted to give me their business cards and contact info to so they can be notified when I finally do Launch they want to support it and that was a really really fun night. So because we had wine bottles on the table I Needed I needed labels. Otherwise, they're just gonna be shiners They were just gonna be you know blank bottles with nothing on it so these were two initial designs that I was sort of playing around with and Because it's all we had Let's just throw the labels on here just to make it look like an actual wine brand During that charity event and that's kind of what we ended up with with the was these two The quality isn't very good. There's air bubbles and stuff But anyway, it is it is what it is and it served the function for that event now Let's talk about where we are at this point. So like like I mentioned I'm launching with four different varietals Sauvignon Blanc Chardonnay Pinot Noir and a Cabernet Sauvignon I Personally approved all four of these wines out of seven wines that were available to me at that time There's more but what was ready to go in bottles. That's what I had and out of the seven I mean the Saraw was amazing these four seem to be great anchors and there's variety So if you like a bold cab, I got you if you like a medium-body Pinot Noir from Southern Central Coast California, Santa Unite Valley. I got you if you like a Chardonnay without that butter bomb I got you there's a little bit of oak in it But it's not that crazy thick heavy Napa Chardonnay. That's just a complete butter bomb I know a lot of people like that personally. I'm not a huge fan This has just a little bit of oak So you know that it's a Chardonnay and the Sauvignon Blanc is just a nice crisp clean citrusy Like lunchtime brunch wine. It's all just really and I'm excited. Can you tell I'm excited I will put the final label designs up on the screen so you guys can see What what they look like what I'm sort of running with at the moment I wanted to play around and tweak the designs even more than what you're seeing. I Just had to get it done What's that saying done is what better better is the enemy of done because it can always be better Just get it done because I didn't want any of this process To be held up because of me and my decisions. I needed to get things done on time when I'm told to do Okay, this is do do this and I was like on it right away and got everything got everything handed off Websites coming up next Labels we're still waiting for labels through the state websites next I wrote copy for the websites I don't have bottle images because I don't have labels on bottles yet So I will handle that once the bottles come in wrote copy images For the website just to get it launched. I just ended up going with some stock imagery It is what it is. I'll fill that in as we sort of get rolling along What else that's kind of it. Oh names names trademarks. I Had to go through trademark to see if I could call this wine Dino. I think it's Section 33 or 35 or something like that like it's alcohol in a bottle. I think that's what it sort of encompasses So the names that you're seeing on the labels that I'm putting up on the screen Those names have been trademarked by me and the one interesting thing is The godfather it was available It had been abandoned. I think there was a lot of searches that we did. I think the godfather had been abandoned But it was completely available and he did his search on on his end. He's an attorney He knows how to do all that stuff clearly or obviously And he was like dude. It's it's available. Do you want to try to snag it? I'm like, yeah Like why doesn't Coppola have that? I don't know. Anyway, so that was a whole process and morphes and It's at this point. It's just it's just a waiting game and also on the side of every label right here There's if you can see that I know it's kind of shiny. There is a little paragraph Talking about why I named the wine what I named it and it's It's really cool. I mean, it's really cool. There's There's messages and meanings behind All for these wines and of course why I'm doing the whole thing to begin with so there's just again a lot of things that are Just out of my control and that's why I haven't launched it just yet, but it'll happen It will definitely it has to happen. I'm neck deep in fees. So it's It will happen. It's just not going to happen on the timeline that I wanted it. I feel like I Needed to capture the holidays, right the black Friday stuff and I feel like I may May have missed the boat a little bit on sales. It just it seems to me like No one really wants to spend money in January, right? It's just the last two months have been You know party after party gift-giving gift buying spending money on presents and travel and and all of that And so people are just sort of shutting down in January But anyway, it's gonna be what it's gonna be right and I hope you do support the brand Support me when it does come out. You'll know trust me. You'll know I'll splash it all over the place once it finally is Released because a lot of you have been asking me on Instagram DMs and also in comments on the YouTube channel like where's the wine when it's gonna be available How do I buy it? It's just not it's not available yet. It will be I promise it will be it will be like I said It has to happen because I'm I'm fully committed at this point What else I think that pretty much wraps up globally. What's going on with the wine brand? Lots of other changes in my life crazy stuff crazy mega lots lots happening lots happening Maybe I'll do a Q&A. I should do the last Q&A video of the season check my Instagram if you don't follow me over there or Leave a question for me here. I can source from both different places here and on Instagram and I'll do a Last Q&A video of of 2024 and I'll do it this month. Maybe next or a week from now something I'll get that done for you. So that's kind of what's going on Last happening lots happening. Maybe I'll make a life update video at some point. Maybe January. We'll do something like that But yeah lots happening. Thank you for the the support so far for the interest so far It will be available online to start with so if you want some It's gonna be online. That's what I can tell you right now. So thank you guys very much I appreciate each and every one of you and thanks for watching this video all the way through Like I said leave me a comment or leave me a question for that Q&A video and I'll make it next week Yeah, this video will come out on the 19th and so let's do it next week.

        "transcript": " I stood up, I grabbed her hand, and we both walked out the door to get outside so we could come back in through the door. Everyone at our table was watching us. I held her hand, I held the door open for her, and we basically walked in together. It almost blew her mind. She couldn't quite explain why, but she just said it felt perfect. You can also do what I like to call the walnut trick. Alright gentlemen, this is a video that you might find a little bit douchey, but at this point man, I really don't care because if I need to throw myself on the fire to help out or save at least one of you, then so be it. And also guys, if you don't care about making a great first impression or if you think that women are the devil, have a great day and I'll see you in the next video. This video is for the guys that want solid, committed relationships with women and are tired of being single. Things are getting pretty savage out there and I hear it from a lot of you and I see it from myself. But the simple fact is man, if you want to change your situation, you have to change your perspective and the way that you operate. And that's pretty much true with anything that you want to change in your life. And please understand that I don't necessarily want you to change for someone else. Making small changes to attract the love of your life is one thing. But also everything that I'm going to mention in this video will benefit you regardless and that's what's most important, making changes that ultimately benefit you and your life. First things first, stop consuming all of those red pill, blue pill, black pill, relationship type videos on social media. They're brainwash. There are so many of these video podcasts out there from both sides blaming each other for all of the problems in today's dating world. Now, some of them do make some pretty good points, but most of them are just so incredibly toxic that it's a wonder anyone's getting together at all. It's mostly just a bunch of negativity and name calling and blaming and it's doing absolutely nothing to help your mental well-being. So shut off the noise, tune it out and get back to the basics of turning yourself into a really impressive option that should be crazy to pass up because it's all about you my friend and taking charge of what you can control about yourself. You can't change other people, but you can absolutely change you. I'm going to start with some things that you can do right now before you meet anyone. Then I'm going to talk about some things you can do when you actually secure the date with someone and take her out because I had a personal experience recently that I wanted to share with you. So stick around for that. Start with your personal presentation. Gentlemen, before you say it doesn't matter, it does because if you move through life with the attitude that you don't care how you look or clothes shouldn't matter, you will most likely never achieve anything better and you won't attract the type of woman that can bring actual value into your life. The fact is this, a man's sense of style and what he wears is absolutely critical because it signals who you are within the first like five seconds of her seeing you. And if you're out there living your life, but also trying to attract women, it's a pretty good idea to understand some of the things they're looking for and then use that to your advantage and having a sense of style is near the top of that list. Also, take care of your face, man. It's the only one that you have and it's not getting any younger. I'm in my fifties and even though I'm aging as we all do, the skin on my face is in pretty good shape and that's because I've been using skin care since I think I was in my mid forties. It doesn't have to be anything stupid expensive or time consuming. Just do what I do and grab yourself some tea hand. Seriously, if this stuff didn't work for me and if I didn't believe in it, I wouldn't keep spending my own money on it every single month like I've been doing for I think the last seven years. Now there's a link down in the description. So my advice would be that if you're just getting started, start out with a level one system. You'll get the daily face wash and exfoliating scrub that you can use twice a week, a morning moisturizer with SPF and a nighttime moisturizer. However, if you want to level up a little bit and use the same stuff I use, get the level three kit. It comes with all those items I just mentioned plus an anti-aging super serum and an eye solution to handle those wrinkles around your eyes. If you've heard me talk about Tish Hanley before but you still haven't pulled the trigger, now is the time because this December, Tish Hanley is offering one of their biggest deals of the year exclusively for first time subscribers. Check this out. Right now for a limited time, you can save up to 40% off your first box today. Not only that, but they'll also give you a free gift. You can choose between this new body scrubber that you can use in the shower or this really cool manicure set that every guy needs. And when you sign up as a member, you'll continue to get 20% off for life. You can pause, cancel or customize the different items that you want to receive at any time. So again, don't wait. This is as good as it gets. Just click that first link down below in the description to lock in one of the best deals of the year and get started on your skincare journey today. Let me circle back to attitude for just a minute. So take a close hard look at yourself and identify how you really feel about women. If you've been poisoned by all the crap on social media, either admit that to yourself or dig a little bit deeper and find out what your actual feelings are. Because what you might find is all of the programming from social media is giving you a different perspective than what's truly yours. It's almost like Misery Loves Company and there's a lot of pissed off miserable guys out there and they want you to be pissed off and miserable too. And that way it's not just them. They can feel more validated that way. And I know it's a very deep rabbit hole situation, but I guess what I'm trying to say here is that if it's not how you really feel, don't fall into the trap because living a life full of anger and vengeance won't lead you to happiness. Okay, it's story time. So I told you that I had a recent experience. So here's what happened. A few weeks ago, I took myself out to one of the local wineries here in Temecula and I ran into a friend of mine and he was sitting there with three other people who I didn't know. He came over and invited me to join their table. So of course I said yes. Now there was one other guy and there were two other women. Now they were all friends and I think they were all single. And at some point we got on this topic of alpha males and manners and what's wrong with the dating scene today and the women wanted my opinion. So I started talking about some things that I do on dates that I see most men not doing that I think are mistakes. For example, when I'm out with someone and we're approaching an establishment, I think that it's a mistake to open the door for her and let her walk in before me. I think the correct way is to grab her hand, open the door with my other hand, walk in first and then hold the door for her so she can walk in with me or maybe just slightly behind me. Now I know it's kind of hard to explain and it gets a bit finicky and she didn't quite understand. So I said, let me show you. I stood up, I grabbed her hand and we both walked out the door to get outside so we could come back in through the door. So at this point, everyone at our table was watching us. So once again, I held her hand, I held the door open for her and we basically walked in together with me just slightly ahead. We all sat back down and kind of talked about it and it almost blew her mind and she just said it felt perfect. She couldn't quite explain why, but she just said it felt perfect. So then the guy that I knew at the table wanted to get up and try it. So the two of them practiced together for a few times and we all continued to have a pretty fun night together. But just that one single move of walking her through a door that way impressed her to the point of changing her mindset of how things should be and how different men act in certain ways, care themselves differently and have better manners. I get it though, right? Opening the door for her and letting her walk in first does come from a very good place. It comes from a place of wanting to care for her and being chivalrous. And that's great in everything. But technically, at least in my opinion, you should lead the way through the door. I think that you should also lead the way to a table at a restaurant instead of having her lead the way. And for the record, it's not really that big of a deal, but if we're talking about manners and impressing her with your actions and how you operate, then it is kind of a big deal. Now the same thing goes with opening the car door. It should go without saying that if you're on a date, you open the car door for her every single time, period. Now something else I wanted to mention is that if you're out somewhere, you're dressed well, of course, and you're just sort of mingling, try to keep your hands out of your pockets. It kind of makes you look a little bit closed off and a little awkward. But I know it's very comfortable, but try to find something else to do with your hands. Now one thing you can do instead of jamming your hands all the way down inside your pockets is to just hook your thumbs in. This still keeps your hands visible. You can also do the TP thing, but this is generally better when you're sitting down. Now I'm going to demonstrate something that I do, but I'm going to hold my hands a little bit higher so you can see it on this camera. But what I generally try to do is I'll sort of hold my thumb, sort of like this, or I'll put my fingers into the palm of my hand and then sort of close my hand over the top. And you can do this sort of both sides and just sort of hold it. You can also do what I like to call the walnut trick, where you are pretending to hold a walnut in your fingers and you just sort of kind of pass it between your hands in a very slow, very slow and smooth manner, sort of like this. You can just kind of hold it here for a little bit, mess around, go back over to this side, just something to do with your hands. Now here's something else that's really impressive and it has to do with your level of fitness. Now this might be some tough love for some of you, but the fact is most men over the age of 40 have let themselves go to the point that they're completely out of shape and bored ordering on obese. That's just how it's become. But if you're the guy with the discipline to take care of yourself, exercise and keep yourself in shape, that automatically puts you in the top 1% of men in your age bracket on that initial first impression. Just think about that. Now, the new year is coming. Is this the year that you finally make it happen and get yourself in shape? It's up to you, man. How bad do you want it? I think at this point the video is probably long enough, but if you want a part two, please let me know in the comments and I will definitely make it happen. And if you enjoyed this video, please tap the like button and also consider subscribing if you're not already. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, let's talk about something that we all know, but don't really talk about all that much. And that is that cozy little prison called your comfort zone. You know the one, right? It's that place that's super comfortable, so comfortable in fact that it's actually slowing you down and you might have a hard time letting go of it. So if you don't mind, let's shake things up here and get you living a life that's more exciting, a lot more meaningful and a whole lot less boring. So grab some coffee or whiskey, I don't judge and let's talk about how you can start making everyday count from here on out. This whole video is going to be about exploring that big ass world that's outside of your comfort zone. And I can talk about this stuff all day long because I have made it a point to continuously get out of my comfort zone and say yes to new opportunities. But here's the thing, I'm no better than anybody and in fact I'm probably more just like you than you might even think. I've been through a ton of shit man, just like you. I've experienced death and trauma in my teenage years to being completely broke as an adult to building myself back up to where I am today. And listen, I know that teaching old dogs new tricks is very challenging. I know this because like I said, I'm just like you. I am basically my own demographic that I speak to on this channel. But because I've been through the ringer many times in my life and I've come out the other side better off, I'm living proof that there's a great big world out there that you will never see if you don't start taking advantage of opportunities. Start saying yes. I've talked about this a lot in my past videos but start saying yes to more opportunities. Even if it might seem small. So think about how many times this last month that you've said no. So maybe your buddy asked you to go paddle boarding. You said no. Maybe your lady friend wanted to go hit up that art festival downtown. But every single no is a missed opportunity. But understand that saying yes doesn't mean that you need to turn into a yes man. It just means that you're open to new experiences. Start small. So next time someone invites you to go do something you normally just avoid, say, sure, why not? It's so easy just to say yes. And I'm telling you, it can open doors to some amazing experiences that you would have otherwise never had. Here's something else. Start dressing better. Look, a lot of what I talk about on this channel is focused around style. And that's because it's relatively easy to do and it makes a big difference. And I still get pushed back almost every single time I make a style video from guys who say that it doesn't matter and I only dress for comfort. I dress for me and who cares what other people think. And to those people, dude, you're missing the point. It's about you. It's about your self respect, your self worth and how you see yourself. First things first, stop wearing t-shirts every day and start wearing something a little more interesting. You can wear a Henley or maybe you can wear a nice polo. But I'm not talking about those cheap cotton polos that you might be used to from like 15 years ago. I'm talking about current modern polos that look amazing. I highly recommend collars and co polos because they have sturdy collars that always look nice and sharp. They're made from lightweight, rinko resistant material that's perfect for travel or everyday wear. They also have some really nice soft collar polos that look amazing as well, just like this one I'm wearing. But not only that, they also have some amazing lightweight quarter zip sweaters and of course some heavier weight sweaters that are great for the colder weather. They also have their new Maverick Blazer with stretch fabric that you can literally roll up and put in your carry on and when you take it out, it'll have virtually no wrinkles. Besides their short sleeve polos, a few more pieces that I think you should take a closer look at is the long sleeve Merino Polo and the Montana long sleeve button up shirt. They literally have everything you need to expand your wardrobe from days at the office to evenings out. There's going to be a link down below in the description to a special offer that's going to get you a discount on anything that you want to go pick up. And I really do encourage you to go surf around their website and see all the new stuff they have. Just use the link in the description and start shopping for something that you need and also think about grabbing something for that guy on your Christmas list this year. Anything you give someone from Commerce & Co. will be a home run. Let's talk about some more ways you can start to step outside of your comfort zone but also find some value. Here's a personal example. So I said yes recently to a quick salsa class. Don't laugh but guess what? Not only did I find out that I can actually do it but I also met some really cool people and had a pretty fun night. I totally get it though right because saying yes to things might feel sort of awkward at first because now you kind of feel like you're obligated to go do something but so does wearing like a business suit for the first time. You just grow into it and it just becomes part of what you do. Here's another one. Join a sports club. You can pick anything you want right. It can be softball or pickleball. That's a good one. Bowling. It can be whatever you want and you don't even have to be that good at it and it isn't always about the physical exercise right. It's more about the camaraderie and some friendly trash talk and maybe an excuse to go grab some beers after. Here's another one. Women love a man who can cook right. So if you're anything like me and you're just not a very good cook, join a cooking class. Picture this gentlemen. You're a single guy in a cooking class full of women. You've got a pan in one hand and a wine glass in the other and you're learning how to make pasta from scratch. You're meeting new people. You're learning something new and now you'll have the ability to whip up something pretty impressive for your next date night. Also if the class is full of women, you just might be the most popular person in the class. Explore your town like a tourist because most people have no idea what's happening in their own backyards. That needs to stop right now. Do what I do. Follow local event spaces, restaurants and community pages on social media. That way you can always stay updated on things going on like festivals, tribunites or live music or even really weird stuff like goat yoga. Look it up. Make it your mission to attend at least one local event every single week. Now sure, some might not be very exciting but others will be and you'll meet people. And who knows? You might even stumble into a new passion like pottery or making craft beer. Get out of your house and travel even if it's just a day trip or a weekend road trip. You don't need to backpack across Europe to have an adventure. You can take a day trip to a nearby city that you've never been to. Solo travel can be pretty fun because it forces you out of your routine and it makes you be more resourceful. Now it's been a while but I used to do this literally all the time. I would take a day and just drive over to the coast to look at the ocean or drive out the Palm Springs just to walk around and have some lunch. And trust me, nobody cares that you're sitting there having lunch by yourself. And think about it. Wouldn't it make a really neat story to tell about that one time you kind of got lost up that mountain road and found the best barbecue place of your life? Okay, I know that hitting the gym or cleaning up your diet doesn't sound super exciting to many of you but hear me out. Taking care of your body isn't just about looking good. It's about feeling good because exercise boosts your energy, it improves your mood and it gives you more stamina to keep up with all those cool things that you're saying yes to now. Here is a little cheat code. Pick the activities that you enjoy because if you hate running, don't do it. But if you're like cycling, do that. And also try to mix things up. Try some yoga for some flexibility, weightlifting to build muscle or maybe hiking just to get outside. Also, when you're in the gym, if you don't like doing certain exercises, just don't do those. Use the weights that you like and use the machines that you like because if you hate doing RDLs, your time in the gym won't be as enjoyable as it otherwise could be. Now here is something else that comes along with saying yes to new opportunities and that's building a better social circle. If your current circle of friends only wants to sit around and complain about life, it's time to expand your circle. Surround yourself with people who inspire you to be better, to try new things and to dream bigger. Something else. Find maybe a passion project. I mean, maybe you've always wanted to write a book or learn woodworking or take up photography. Whatever that is, stop waiting for some day and just start. Passion projects can give your life a lot more meaning and more direction. And along the way, don't forget to be kind to yourself. Like man, cut yourself some slack. Growth takes time and you're going to mess up along the way. That's all part of the process. Laugh at your mistakes and learn from them but keep going. Being a better man doesn't mean being perfect. It means being willing to try. And that's how you go from living an average life to a meaningful one. Gentlemen, if you made it this far, you are one of the true legends. So please hit that like button to let me know. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " It is getting cold. And all my friends, all you over in the northeastern part of the US, you've been dealing with a lot of snow. And we haven't even hit the first official day of winter yet. And I feel like it's shaping up to be a very long season. However, over here in Southern California, the day I'm filming this video, it's a beautiful sunny 78 degrees outside. So what I want to try to do is to show you a bunch of different examples on how you can dress for the cold weather, but still remain stylish. And of course, this is going to be kind of difficult because, of course, different parts of the world have different weather. And it's impossible for me to give examples. It will cover every single region in one single video. So what I'm going to try to do is to give some examples that sort of go right down the middle in terms of climate. So stick with me. I'm going to show some casual outfit ideas and some more dressy ideas. Starting out with this super casual look with these sort of medium wash blue jeans. Now, I've also got a dark brown knit sweater, this brown suede trucker jacket, and of course, these medium brown boots from today's sponsor Thursday Boot Company, but more on them in just a little bit. If you're familiar with the color wheel, you know that blue and brown always look great together. And that's exactly what I wanted to do with this outfit. It's casual, but everything works really well together. For this next look, I swapped out the brown jacket for this blue suede bomber. It's still really casual, but the bomber jacket is just a little bit more elevated than the trucker style jacket. The trucker jacket is still amazing, but this one sort of notches things up a little bit. I've got the same sweater and, of course, the same boots. Now, I went back to the suede trucker jacket also from Thursday, a lighter brown sweater, and I changed the boots for these brown suede chucka boots. Still casual, of course, but everything just works really well together. And, of course, this won't work in like minus five degree weather, but the general idea and the color combo is what I'm trying to convey. Keeping this sweater and the chucka boots, I went back over to the blue bomber jacket. I like this one a lot because it has contrast and the blue and the brown tones, once again, work great together. All of the boots and some of the jackets I'm wearing in this video are all from Thursday Boot Company. Now, you might be familiar with their boots because, seriously, they have got some of the best boots on the market, period, for some of the lowest prices out there, especially considering the quality of these boots. But they also have other amazing items like jackets, dress shoes, and sneakers. Thursday is one of my favorite brands, and I've got a ton of their stuff because I just, I love everything they do. Even after all of these years, they continue to offer the lowest direct-to-consumer prices on Goodyear-welted boots, leather sneakers, dress shoes, and leather jackets, all made with premium USA leather. Everything is made with incredible quality, but you don't have to pay those ridiculous overpriced retail markups for high quality pieces that are built to last. I have several pair of Thursday boots, sneakers, and jackets that I've had for years now, and even today, they still look and feel amazing. I can't say enough good things about Thursday boots and their products, and I really do encourage you to go check out these incredible boots and everything else that they make, like their jackets and also their sneakers. They also have stuff for women, so you might want to consider picking up something for your wife or your girlfriend, too. Just go through that special link down below in the description box and go see everything they have because I know, at least I'm very confident, you're going to find something that you absolutely love. Thank you Thursday boots for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, now trying to ratchet things up just a little bit, so I went with these darker brown leather Chelsea boots and this dark brown suede bomber jacket. Now the jeans are the same as before, but I went back to the dark brown sweater. I really do like the contrast with this one, and I like how well the jacket, the sweater, and the boots just all go together perfectly. It's still casual, but we're starting to step things up. All right, light gray jeans are some of my favorites right now, so I wanted to throw together two different looks here. I went back to the first pair of boots I was wearing earlier. These are the suede captains in the safari colorway. I also put on a different light brown sweater and of course the suede trucker jacket. Once again, it's super casual, but everything just works really well together. For this one, I just swapped out the jacket, so I don't know about you, but I really love this color texture combo of the light brown sweater and the dark brown suede jacket. It's just a really cool combo, at least in my opinion, but I am kind of curious what you guys think, so leave me a comment down below and let me know your thoughts on that one. Here we go with some dark wash denim. So everything in this one is dark tones. I've got the dark brown Chelsea boots, the dark brown sweater, and the dark brown jacket. Everything is simple. Everything fits well, and the dark blue against the dark brown works great together. Once again, if it's colder where you live, maybe just add another layer under the jacket or go with a heavier winter jacket. Then next, I wanted to see how this combo would look, and I thought about not including in the video because I really didn't like it as much as I thought I would, but I thought it was at least worth talking about. So here's the thing for me. The boots are elevated, the jeans are more elevated, and the sweater is also elevated. But the jacket, although an amazing piece on its own, is just a little bit too casual for this particular outfit. So once we start adding more elevated pieces, we have to sort of make sure that everything else moves up the scale together. Once again, I love the jacket, but let's look at a different combo. All right, here we go. This one just seems to work a lot better in my opinion, right? Nothing really stands out and just shouts at you because everything just works together. Once again, dark brown Chelsea's, dark wash jeans, dark brown sweater, and a dark blue suede bomber jacket. So for me, this one's the home run. Let me know your thoughts on this one down below. Okay, we're increasing the level of insulation factor with this one, starting out with a white polo, a dark brown sweater, the same boots, the same dark jeans, but this time I went with a wool charcoal gray top coat. And keep in mind, like I said before, it is almost 80 degrees out at this point, and I'm starting to roast. I had to turn on the ceiling fan just to keep some air moving around. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying. Moving away from denim for these last few outfits, I wanted to build something around these blue chinos, and I like how this one turned out. Dark brown Chelsea's, the amazing tan sweater, and the dark blue bomber. Everything about this just works in my opinion, and I really like how well that sweater sort of breaks up all the blue tones. It's such a cool sweater and the color's perfect. I don't get a chance to wear top coats very often at all, so I wanted to try one more look. So I went with this tan top coat and then of course the same sweater. Chinos and boots adds the last look. I think it's a solid look, but I also feel like a lot of guys have this style of jacket. So I wanted to throw it in here just to give you guys another idea on how you might style it. Let's talk about earth tones for just a minute. I talk about color theory quite a bit in my videos, so here is a real world example. Brown boots, olive chinos, a burgundy sweater, a white polo, and a dark brown jacket. Olive and burgundy are complementary colors that always look good together. So throw in the brown boots, jacket, and this is a really nice cold weather fall outfit. So then I got a little carried away here and I wanted to try a blue zip sweater and a blue jacket. I still think it works pretty well, but I think the burgundy with the brown is definitely the right move. I would still of course wear this one, but if I had to choose between this one and the last one, I would go burgundy with brown all day long. Let me know what you think. And really quick, if you made it this far in the video, you are one of the true legends, so please hit that like button to let me know you made it this far. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching, live well, and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " All right, my friend, let's just go ahead and cut to the chase. You're single, you're dating, and tonight, if all goes well, you're hoping to get a little one-on-one time with that someone special. But here's the thing, your charisma and your charm doesn't stop when you leave the restaurant or the lounge, right? That killer smile of yours and your good conversation skills is only going to get you so far. And if you're inviting her over, both you and your home need to be ready. Think of it like this, you are creating a vibe and an experience for her. You want her to walk in and think like, Holy cow, this guy has got it all together because nothing will kill the moment faster than a stinky house, a dirty bathroom, or bedsheets with random strands of long, dark hair when the girl you're with is a blonde. Yeah, complete deal breaker. But look, don't worry because I've got you covered. Stay tuned. And I know you don't even have to say it because I know this video might come off a little bit douchey. But if that's what it takes to help somebody out, then so be it. Because the truth is, I know a few guys personally that have been married for over 20 years and now they find themselves single in their late 40s. These are good guys with good jobs and they're just out there trying to work on the next chapter of their lives. But they're out of practice when it comes to dating. So hopefully this video can help. The first point that I want to hammer home is that your place needs to be clean. And I know that sounds obvious, but I'm not talking about sort of kind of clean or just don't look over there clean. I'm talking legit clean and decluttered. We live in our spaces every day and we see it every day. And because of that, some of that clutter and not so clean areas become sort of invisible to us. But I can guarantee you that it'll be highly visible to your lady friend when she comes over. It's all about having a clean space with zero to very minimal clutter in the kitchen. Clear off your countertops and put away any and all dishes that might be out. But look, I know you use that air fire and that smoothie blender every single day. But for the sake of tonight, put it away in a cabinet or something. You can bring it back out tomorrow. Don't worry. I would also advise you to take your trash out earlier that day and wipe everything down, including your sink. If your garbage disposal stinks a little bit, put some ice cubes and a lemon wedge down there and run it. Let's move on to the bathroom because this is non-negotiable. She is guaranteed to use your bathroom at some point to freshen up and check her makeup and hair. If she walks in there and sees a moldy toilet with yellow stains all over it or a crusty water ring or dried up toothpaste on your countertop, you just absolutely destroyed the vibe because now you're no longer that charming, sophisticated guy. Now you're sort of gross and her vision of you just changed. A couple of things. Make sure there's plenty of toilet paper, a clean hand towel. No, not the one that you've been using all week. And also have some type of room spray or air freshener that's visible and ready to go. If you have any embarrassing items, maybe in the medicine cabinet or in the bathroom drawers, you might want to consider just putting those somewhere else for the time being before she comes over. Shifting gears for just a minute before we get into your bedroom where hopefully the magic is going to happen. We need to chat about you and making sure that you're ready. I'm assuming at this point that whatever you're wearing looks pretty decent, but the question is how are you doing down there? What I mean is if your pants come off, what type of underwear are you running with and do you smell? Look, man, we're all adults and we should be able to talk about this stuff. But do this, do this right now if you can. Take your hand, jam it down your pants and slide it up sort of next to your balls and your leg and then smell your fingers. Is it sort of nasty? And if it is, do you think she wants to smell that? Now, I know this is obvious, but please shower and use some ball powder before your date and wear high quality, breathable underwear. So cotton underwear fits great right out of the dryer, but after about an hour or so, they just get really stretched out and they don't retain their shape. And that's why you lose support and they look terrible and they also give you that stupid wedgie every time you sit down and stand up again. And that's where SiltCut underwear comes in. Look, I've talked about this brand many times before and I've mentioned that I'm very picky when it comes to the underwear that I wear. Now, trunks are my personal favorite style and also most women prefer this style. These are the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn. They're ultra breathable and they also maintain their support all day long. It's sort of crazy because wearing these, it almost feels like you're not wearing anything at all. They're designed for extreme comfort and a nice seam free design. They also have these bonded waistbands and leg openings so it gives you a seamless look underneath your pants or your chinos. You get the perfect balance of support and room right where you need it the most and the amazing silk pouch liner adds an extra layer of style. They're made from a blend of micro modao and spandex so they provide comfort, stretch and amazing durability. And gentlemen, I'm telling you, this level of softness and breathability is absolutely amazing. And for a limited time, they're giving all of you an amazing offer of 50% off your entire order when you use my code. The special link with my discount code is going to be listed down below in the video description box. And once again, 50% off your entire order for a limited time. Gentlemen, don't wait on this one. Okay, let me jump back over to how your place smells and what you can do about it. Here's the thing. If you made yourself some seafood for lunch earlier that day, chances are your house is still going to smell like fish. You don't want that. Get some set diffusers and place them in different areas around your house. But most diffusers won't come with set timers, but what you can do is get outlets that connect to your Wi-Fi so you can turn everything on from your phone, maybe like an hour or so before you start heading for home. I'm telling you, it is massively impressive to her to walk into your home and have it smell like a five-star hotel. She'll notice it right away and she'll definitely say something about it. Make sure you're stocked up on a few essentials, right? Drinks and snacks. Have a few drink options on hand. So I would recommend a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white because she might not like the same thing that you like. It's also a good idea to have some non-alcoholic choices like flavored sparkling water with snacks. Go for cheese crackers and dark chocolate. Keep it simple, but also classy. Now we're getting to the fun stuff like setting the mood. So make sure you've got a playlist that's chill and sexy, but not super sleepy. Skip the heavy metal for now along with anything that's got really distracting lyrics. Keep it chill and sort of ambient. Check on her and ask if she's too cold or too warm and then adjust your temperature accordingly. Also have some candles ready to go. So don't fuss around in front of her trying to gather a bunch of candles and then place them in different areas. Have them all ready to go. So all you need to do is just walk around and light a few of those candles. Also, if you need to excuse yourself, go light the candles in the bedroom without her knowing. We'll talk about that in a minute. All right, gentlemen, next is the bedroom. So let's get real. If things go well, the night will most likely end up there. So let's make sure it's ready. This is the moment of truth, my friend. This is where the magic will hopefully happen. So you absolutely need to have clean sheets. Fresh, clean bed sheets are non-negotiable. If you don't remember the last time you changed your sheets, it's definitely time. And for the love of all things romantic, please ditch the cartoon character or floral bedding if that's what you're still using. Your bed should be made perfectly before you even walk in and those candles you lit a while ago should be burning. Your dresser, your bedside tables and your bathroom should be clutter free and clean. And also, nobody wants to sort of navigate this minefield of stuff on your floor. Your bedroom should be neat and tidy. Let's talk about lighting because harsh overhead lights are not a good move whatsoever. Go for warm, soft lighting. Now, if you've got a corner lamp or some dim bedside lamps, use those. But please do not walk in to your bedroom, flip on a light switch and have the whole place light up like the 4th of July. Maybe have like one small lamp already on or if those candles are enough light, just use those. And speaking of candles, don't overdo it with crazy scents, right? Because smells can be kind of a big deal for women and that can either be something that's inviting and comforting or it can be a complete mood killer. Stick with neutral or fresh scents like vanilla, sound of wood or citrus. Avoid those stronger masculine scents like tobacco and oak. And also avoid anything that's too powdery or soapy that might remind you of grandma's house. And one more thing really quick, man. If you made it this far in this video, you are one of the true legends. So please hit that like button to let me know you made it this far. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one. And gentlemen, do not forget to go click that link in the description and grab yourself some amazing underwear from Silk Cut. I'm out for 50% off."

        "transcript": " Let's face it gentlemen, how you dress says a lot about who you are, but it's not just about looking good, it's about presenting yourself in a way that reflects your maturity and your life experience. But here's the thing, right? Here's the thing, way too many guys over 40 are still rating their son's wardrobe. I mean look, graphic t-shirts, flip flops, baggy pants, hoodies, sweatpants, and workout only, athleisure of course have their place, but let's be honest, that place probably isn't on you anymore, at least not out in public. And before anybody gets triggered man, look, if that's how you like to dress, go for it. You don't need my opinion. But if you're in your 40s or beyond, like I am, and you need an upgrade, it's time to take a closer look at your wardrobe. Your clothing should be working for you, not against you. And also please understand that dressing intentionally doesn't mean that you have to spend a whole lot of money or be uncomfortable. It's just about making better choices that match who you are and where you are in life right now. So let's break this down. Why dressing intentionally matters? So when you're in your 20s, you can get away with almost anything fashion-wise, right? I mean, ripped jeans, sure. Worn out sneakers, yeah, why not? Maybe an oversized hoodie with one of those sarcastic slogans on the front of it. Yeah man, go for it. But as you get older, you should try to stand out in different ways, right? And not by dressing like a teenager, but by showing off your maturity and style. I've said this before and I will say it again. Your 40s are your prime years, right? Because this is typically a time when a lot of men sort of hit their stride professionally and personally. You have worked your ass off for years up to this point and you've gained a lot of life experience and hopefully you've achieved a sense of who you are. Your clothing should reflect this stage of your life. But wearing things that are too youthful can give off the impression that you're still holding on to the past because you're unsure of yourself and you lack direction. All right, the sun's wardrobe problem. So let's talk about those graphic t-shirts. You know the ones. The cheesy slogans, the offensive punch lines, the pop culture references that were cool 20 years ago, those just don't work anymore. Now sure, you and your buddies still might think that's sort of funny, but that's more of like an inside joke. Nobody else gets it and it can make you look really outdated and also off-putting. Flip-flops are another big offender. And here's the thing, unless you're at the beach or at a pool or maybe mowing your lawn or something, flip-flops should just be completely off limits. They scream college spring break instead of self-assured grown man. And let's not also forget about those baggy pants, right? This isn't 1998 anymore and oversized clothing hardly ever looks good on anyone regardless of how old you are. Let's talk about shirts because it's not about giving up comfort or your individuality. It's more about just sort of refining your choices. You also don't need to be flashy and wear bright colors and bold patterns every day. My advice would be to just try to give up t-shirts and go with casual button-ups and polos a little bit more often. And here's a little trick that I like to use to help keep my button-up shirts looking good. Right here, this my friends is the slick collar. It's a flexible piece of thin plastic with these silicone pads on the ends. Basically, you pop your collar up, you put this around the back of your neck and then flip the collar back down. And because of this design, it helps keep your collar and also your placket looking good all day long. Because that's one of the main downsides of dress shirts if you have a couple of these buttons undone. This upper placket area doesn't have any support and it always looks kind of weird and it falls down on itself. The slick collar fixes that problem without having to cut open your shirts or modify anything. You buy this once and swap it over from shirt to shirt. It's simple and after like maybe 10 seconds, you totally forget you even have it on because it is that comfortable. You get three different sizes and some all new premium packaging and they're fully adjustable to fit your neck. You get the regular size that's perfect for most shirt collars. You also get that slim size that's good for polos and thinner collared shirts. And you also get the athletic size that's perfect for larger shirt collars and neck sizes. You also get 10 premium collar stays so you always have spares on hand. Another bonus is it comes in an all new storage box that's offered in both white and black. Both are perfect for not only storing your slick collars but also for storing other accessories like watches, rings and bracelets. There's going to be a special link down below in the description and I really do encourage you guys to go check these out and pick one up for yourself because listen, for the price, it's an absolute no-brainer and I can guarantee you that you will use this a lot more than you think you will. Thank you, Slit Collar for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, here's something else to consider and you can take this or leave it. Dressing like a grown man gains you more respect because the truth is people are naturally drawn to people who look polished and put together. You're showing that you're detail oriented, that you have respect for yourself because you take pride in your appearance and it's not just about vanity, right? It's about self-respect because you put more effort into your appearance than by just grabbing an old dusty t-shirt. There's also a certain kind of swagger that comes from knowing that you look good. Confidence is magnetic and sometimes it just starts with what you wear. Now we've already covered a few of these but here's some things to avoid. Graphic t-shirts. Replace these with plain, well-fitting polos or henleys. Foot flops. Try maybe a nice pair of grown-up sandals or even some leather loafers if you need something sort of casual but also stylish. Baggy pants. Try sizing down or try some slim fitting options that fit more tailored and modern. Hoodies and sweatpants. Drop these out for some nice knit sweaters, quarter zip pullovers or some tailored joggers if you're just lounging around. But if you're heading out, just grab a nice pair of well-fitted jeans. Here's another one. Running shoes are for running, not for everyday wear. Upgrade to leather sneakers or some casual boots for a more age-appropriate look. Also avoid overly trendy items with anything too flashy. Like with timeless classics that aren't going to go out of style in six months. So here's a few building blocks of an intentional wardrobe. Invest in quality basics and start with high quality essentials. White and navy shirts and well-fitting jeans and chinos, those are going to be your foundation. Invest a few bucks in tailoring. No matter what your body type is, clothes that fit well instantly make you look more put together. Grab your shirts, your pants and even some of your jackets tailored to fit you better. Upgrade your shoes and believe it or not, shoes can make or break an outfit. Ditch the old one-out sneakers and grab some leather loafers, Chelsea boots, Chocoboots or some nice minimal leather sneakers. Next, work with layers. Jackets, blazers and cardigans are going to be your best friends because they add depth to your outfit and they're perfect for the cold weather season. Also a nice cotton or suede bomber jacket is a really simple way to elevate a casual look. Also remember that neutral colors and earth tones are key. So populate your wardrobe with neutral tones like gray, navy, black and white and also some earth tones in various shades of brown, olive green and burgundy. Here's what happens when you're dressed intentionally. Something sort of shifts, especially if you start getting compliments. You walk taller, you speak with more authority and you just overall feel good about yourself, you like what you see in the mirror but also understand that confidence isn't about vanity. It's about knowing your worth and expressing that with how you present yourself. It's about you being in control of the tone you're setting for how others perceive you but that doesn't mean that you care what other people think of you. It's just letting them know a little more about who you are before you even speak because face it whether you're at work on a date or maybe just meeting some friends, looking the part matters. It just does. And also I want to be very clear about something. Style and comfort aren't mutually exclusive and the idea that dressing well means that you have to be uncomfortable is completely outdated and false. Work technology has come a very long way and you're able to have a lot more movement and breathability without sacrificing any style. So look for jeans, chinos and even some of your shirts that have stretch fabrics built in because that is an absolute game changer. And one last thing, if you made it this far, you are definitely one of the true legends so please hit that like button to let me know that you made it to the end. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching, live well and I'll see you in the next one."

Show some self-respect in class by not wasting these years Trying to chase something that's long gone So what I'm about to say might make me sound like a big old hypocrite, but look today I want to chat about a few things that grown men do thinking it makes them look younger But when in reality it actually makes them look a lot older now first on my list Here it comes driving a fancy sports car. I know complete hypocrite, but let me explain Okay, but before you get it too twisted I'm actually looking into getting rid of my car and getting back into a nicer sedan But here's the thing though a lot of you know my racing history And then I raced cars up in the Pacific Northwest for just about 10 years and I won a drivers championship in 2006 I would call myself the definition of a car guy and I can justify Buying my car all day long right you cannot win an argument with me over the reasons why I bought that car However, it's just not practical and it gets me a lot of unwanted attention It gets attention pretty much everywhere it goes and sometimes that's kind of cool But other times I don't want the attention right because I'm not looking for the attention So that's one of the reasons why I'm considering some other options I think the main issue though with most guys is they really just don't know anything about cars Like all they want is to drive something that makes them look a certain way and to get a lot of attention and Of course technically there's really nothing wrong with that But that is pretty much the stereotype of any older guy who drives a sports car or an exotic and of course Well, sometimes that's true at least in my case. It's not always true something else that makes guys look older is over using hair dye look man Going gray is a natural part of getting older and far too many men choose to use hair color to cover up their gray the problem is Overdoing it and using colors that are way too dark and inconsistent because it ends up looking artificial And you can see it from a mile away People can always tell roughly how old you are and unnatural hair color is just a dead giveaway And it makes you look older My advice though is to do some type of gray blending or Some kind of hair color that still keeps a good amount of your gray and here's something else that you should know if you're a single guy And you think that coloring your hair makes you look more youthful and even maybe more attractive I'm here as living proof that women absolutely love gray hair I get compliments on my hair color literally all the time and sure I'm lucky enough to still have it, but I don't color it now I have done gray blending in the past and my barber and I were just talking about maybe doing it again Just a few days ago at my last haircut and if you're not sure what gray blending is It's a process that sort of darkens all the white hairs. It's almost like how your hair looks when it's damp It's still gray hair and it doesn't look like you did anything But it just kind of makes everything a shade or two darker another Suggestion is to use purple shampoo, maybe two to three times per week So purple cancels out that yellow brassy tint that a lot of guys get and it makes your hair look more silver like mine and really quick gentlemen getting older can be difficult to deal with sometimes because Not very long ago We were all young men and we didn't have the responsibilities that we do now and that can get overwhelming at times And if you have a lot going on in your head and in your life reach out to the service that I trust and believe in Better help today sponsor better help was a platform where therapists and their clients can communicate effectively and get the most out of therapy They are on a mission to make starting therapy easier and with over 7,000 reviews and a four and a half star rating on trust pilot better help with a platform You can trust there's gonna be a link down below in the description to better help comm slash fashion Clicking on that link gets you 10% off your first month of better help so that you can connect with the therapist and get started on your therapy Journey all you do is fill out a couple questions about what you're looking for and better help will match you with the therapist in As little as a couple days then you can talk to your therapist however You feel comfortable whether it's messaging phone or video You can also message your therapist at any time and schedule live sessions when it's convenient for you And the really cool thing is if you don't click with get that first therapist for whatever reason Which can be sort of common when you're first getting started You can easily switch to a brand new therapist until you find someone that you really connect with Gentlemen, this is a no-brainer if you could use it tune up and get some of your questions answered Please consider online therapy with better help click the link down below in the description or visit Better help comm slash fashion to get 10% off your first month of therapy.

Another thing is over accessorizing with too much jewelry now, of course Accessories can elevate your outfit, but going overboard with flashy jewelry or oversized watches can make you look a bit outdated It's funny. I will see guys with thick chunky chains and rings on almost every finger earrings big shiny belt buckles and gigantic watches and Unfortunately when you put all of that together it just signals More midlife crisis than it does youthfulness stick to classic understated pieces and remember less is more a single Standout piece like maybe one nice watch speaks volumes One ring on each hand is plenty a small chain worn inside your shirt So you can still see it is plenty if you want to wear a bracelet a thin leather or metal bracelet Can add a touch of class without overpowering your whole look also keep your sunglasses functional But also stylish there is no need to wear those big gigantic oversized blades like all the kids are wearing All right now We have to talk about wearing overly trendy clothing because nothing screams Trying too hard like wearing all the trends that are aimed at the 20-somethings Distressed jeans with all the rips and tears and oversized graphic t-shirts and neon colored sneakers are fine for kids But they do absolutely nothing for the refined image that most guys over 40 want to project the key issue here is context fashion trends are designed for a younger demographic in mind and Wearing some of that stuff past 40 actually Accentuates your age because there's this big disparity. So instead focus on timeless wardrobe staples Dark slim jeans not skinny or not oversized well fitted chinos and high quality leather shoes actually Keep you more modern looking pair all that up with nice tailored shirts and minimal sweaters for a stylish and modern look One more thing with clothing a lot of men over 40 fall into one of two categories Squeezing into overly tight clothes to look trendy or wearing baggy oversized pieces strictly for comfort Both of these unfortunately highlight your age instead of helping you look younger Here's another one that I've started seeing recently and has to do with hairstyles once again Guys will generally fall into one of two categories First they hold on to hairstyles They've had since they were in their 20s thinking that that makes them look younger and second They go completely the other direction and try to pull off Hairstyles that you see on kids in high school For example the mullet seems to have made a pretty big comeback and I'm not even sure why but it is what it is It seems like all the kids these days are either doing the alpaca or the mullet So if your 17 year old son has the same hairstyle as you That should be your sign So my advice would be to visit a barber who understands mature hairstyles So they can help you maintain a haircut that not only enhances your features, but makes you look modern You're in your 40s my friend and this is your prime show some self-respect in class by not wasting these years Trying to chase something that's long gone This is your time and this is your opportunity to reinvent yourself and move away from trying to be something that you're not Embrace the life you have right in front of you and gentlemen, please subscribe if you're not already and as always my friends Thank you very much for watching live well, and I'll see you in the next one"

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, let me start with something that you may not hear often enough. You are most likely more attractive than you think you are. Not only that, but you also have the ability to become even more attractive with just a little bit of effort. Now, I know that's a pretty bold statement and you might be thinking that I'm full of shit, but if you're willing to stick around for a little bit, I'll show you how you can increase your level of handsomeness and it's easier than you might think. Let's get one thing clear right away. What makes someone handsome varies from person to person, right? Beauty as they say is in the eye of the beholder. But I hear from guys all the time who feel that they are not particularly good looking and that lack of confidence bleeds into their social lives, their dating lives and even their overall self-esteem. The truth is genetics can only take you so far. I mean, sure, some guys win the genetic lottery and walk around looking like movie stars, but just because we didn't win that lottery, that doesn't give us the excuse to sit on the couch and to not try to be the best version of ourselves that we can. Because the good news is that becoming the best version of yourself isn't about having perfect features. It's about taking charge of the things that you can control. This channel exists to remind you that it's never too late to improve yourself regardless of your age. You're here most likely because you care about bettering yourself and that alone right there sets you apart. So let's talk about some key areas that can help you elevate your look and your presence. Style is your silent superpower. So let's start with personal style because it is truly one of the most transformative tools that you have at your disposal that makes the biggest difference. The way you dress has a direct impact on how others perceive you and more importantly, how you see yourself. Clothes that fit well and suit your body type can enhance your proportions, making you appear taller, slimmer and even more athletic. You don't need to wear suits every day or completely overhaul your entire wardrobe overnight. Instead, focus on upgrading your everyday choices. For example, if you typically wear like graphic t-shirts and jeans, swap out the shirt for maybe a higher quality version without logos and then invest in jeans that fit you properly. Throw in a nice pair of boots and you've already elevated that look without changing who you are. You're wearing the exact same stuff, just better versions. Here's another small upgrade with a very big impact. Swap out your t-shirts for polo shirts. A well-fitted polo creates a more polished appearance and it adds structure to your shoulders and your neck. It draws attention upwards towards your face and it instantly makes you look more put together. I highly recommend collars and co-polos because they have sturdy dress collar polos that always look sharp and they're great for layering. They're made from lightweight wrinkle resistant material that's perfect for travel or everyday wear. Not only that, they also have different styles of polos like this one. They have these amazing lightweight quarter zip sweaters and of course they have some heavier weight sweaters that are great for the colder weather. They also have their brand new Maverick Blazer with stretch fabric that you can literally roll up, putting your carry on and when you take it out, it'll virtually have no wrinkles at all. The fabric is amazing. Besides their short sleeve polos, a few more pieces that I think you should take a closer look at are the Nottingham Long Sleeve Marino Polo and the Montana Long Sleeve Button Up Shirt. They literally have everything you need to expand your wardrobe from day to night. There's going to be a link down below in the description to a special offer that's going to get you a discount on anything that you want to go pick up and I really do encourage you to go surf around their website and take a look at all the new stuff they have. Use that link in the description and start shopping for something that you need and also think about grabbing something for the guy on your Christmas list this year. Anything you give someone from Collars & Co. will be a home run. Okay, on to grooming because the devil is in the details, right? Style gets you noticed but grooming keeps you looking sharp. As we get older, maintaining a clean and polished appearance becomes even more important, right? So let's start with your facial hair. Whether you prefer a full beard, just a goatee or maybe just a clean shave, make sure you're well maintained. Stray hairs can make you look disheveled and that's sort of the opposite of what we're going for. And don't forget the often overlooked details like your nose hairs and your eyebrows. Just a quick trim can make a world of difference, especially when you're face to face with someone. And if you still have a full head of hair, congratulations. Make advantage of that gift by visiting a skilled barber who can help you experiment with some new styles to complement your features. And if you've been sporting the same haircut for like the last 10 years or so, maybe consider growing it out a little bit just to see maybe what else might work for you. Now currently, I'm letting the top grow out a little bit more just to change things up. A fresh hairstyle can completely transform your look. Then invest in your face. So look man, as we age, our skin tends to lose elasticity and hydration, which is why a good skincare routine is very important. Guys, start with the basics. Just a daily moisturizer with SPF to protect against some sun damage and then an eye solution to help reduce wrinkles, puffiness and dark circles. These small steps can make you look more refreshed and vibrant even on your busiest days when you're tired. And if you've never had a skincare routine before, like don't overcomplicate it, right? Just find a few high quality products and stick with it. It's a simple habit that pays off big in the long run. Then we have fitness guys. Move your body. While style and grooming can improve your appearance, fitness is the thing that supports everything else. Man, staying active doesn't just improve your physical health. It boosts your confidence and helps you carry yourself with more energy and more poise. You don't need to be a gym rat or anything, but even light exercise a few times per week can make a big difference. The reality is a strong, healthy body looks great in clothes and it makes finding the right fit a lot easier. Plus, the discipline of staying active translates into other areas of self-improvement, making this positive feedback loop that keeps you motivated. Confidence is your secret weapon, gentlemen. Let's not overlook the most attractive quality of all and that's confidence. You could have the perfect wardrobe and flawless grooming, but without self-assurance of how you're moving through life, you might not stand out in the way that you should. Think back to a time when you got all dressed up for some big event. Maybe it was like a wedding or some special occasion. When you saw yourself in a mirror, all sharp and polished and put together, you probably felt pretty amazing. That is the power of confidence. It's not about what others think about you. It's about how you think and feel about yourself. Confidence isn't really something that you're born with. Something that you build through your life and having small wins. Every time you upgrade your look or try something new or step outside of your comfort zone, you're reinforcing that sense of self-worth. And trust me, nothing is more attractive to a woman than a man who carries himself with quiet confidence. Gentlemen, I hope this inspired you to start taking charge of the things that are in your control and start making small changes that add up to a big overall difference. And if you found this video helpful, I've got another video right here that's packed with even more tips that you'll love. If you're not yet subscribed, please consider hitting that subscribe button. I would love to have you stick around. As always my friends, live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, welcome back to the channel. Today we're answering a really big question. What does it mean to dress age appropriate once you're over 40? It's a question that seems to get a lot of mixed opinions. And some people think it means dressing like your dad. But trust me, that is not what we're talking about. Age appropriate style is more about making better choices that reflect who you are today, your experience, your self-worth, and your self-respect. You can be the most self-respecting guy on the planet. But if you dress in a way that shows the world that you don't have any respect for yourself, nobody is going to respect you. Let's face it, though. Fashion rules are not set in stone. But as we get older, our bodies change. Our lifestyles evolve. And so does the way that we want to present ourselves to the world. So today, I guess I want to try to break down what age appropriate really means. Why it matters, and also give you some practical style tips that you can start using right away. And just for the record, age appropriate does not mean boring. So listen, when we were all young men, experimenting with trends was something that we all basically did in an effort to stay relevant, and of course, to try to fit in. But as we get older, style gets to be more about refinement and quality over quantity. Age appropriate style isn't about giving up on trends or looking older. Quite the opposite, actually. It's about updating your style to fit your current lifestyle, your personality, and even your changing body. And gentlemen, if you're single, this should be important to you. So now that we have the mindset out of the way, let's get into a few wardrobe essentials. Of course, jeans are a staple. But when you're over 40, I think you really want to focus more on the fit and the color. Go for the darker washes, because that's going to be more versatile, and it's going to have a more mature and refined look. Slim, straight, or athletic taper fits are probably going to work the best. Now, make sure they fit you really well, and make sure they aren't too long, where they stack up on top of your shoes, because that is not a good look. A well-fitted blazer or sports jacket instantly adds refinement to any outfit. So whether it's jeans or chinos, you are guaranteed to look polished and put together. So if you only have one, I'd say try to find something in neutral colors like a navy blue or some type of medium to dark gray, because those two colors are going to be the easiest to mix and match. And just like the old saying goes, shoes say a lot about a man, especially as we get a little bit older. And one more time, if you're a single guy, shoes are one of the first things women notice about you, because again, shoes say a lot about who you are, and it's true. So I'd say invest in a good pair of dress shoes, some versatile loafers, and maybe some stylish minimal leather sneakers. No running shoes or athletic shoes, and no flashy logos and colors. Just good quality, comfortable leather sneakers. Now let me talk about a very critical accessory, and that, of course, is your belt. Most guys own two belts, a black one and a brown one. And that's great in everything, and that's probably going to cover a lot of what you normally wear. But what about a dress belt? What about a casual belt? What about a light brown or a dark brown belt? Anson Belt is sponsoring this video, and I've mentioned on multiple occasions that these are basically the only belts that I wear anymore. These are good looking, they're amazing quality, the fit is always perfect, the buckles are all interchangeable, and they have got colors and styles to match just about any outfit and any shoe. One of the coolest things about Anson Belt is never having to worry about a bad fit. This is because all of their belts are designed with this little micro adjustment that always gives you a perfect fit. So think about it, traditional belts have holes spaced out one inch apart, and they never, ever seem to be in the right place. But these micro adjustments are spaced out a quarter inch apart, so even if your waistline fluctuates around the holidays, you'll always have a perfect fit. Anson belts are affordable, they're functional, and they always look fantastic. They also have a ton of different styles and colors and materials that you can choose from. The straps come in leather, canvas, nylon, cloth, and micro suede, as well as vegan and some other premium limited edition materials. Anson Belt and Buckle also makes a great gift for many reasons, one of them being that you don't need to know the exact size of the person that you're gifting to, because these come one length, and you cut them down to fit your body. Now look, there are thousands of combinations to choose from on their website, and in my opinion, these are some of the best belts on the planet. Click the link down below in the description for the best offer going right now. Whether you're purchasing just one belt and one buckle or taking advantage of the best offer with their box sets. Go hit that link down below and find exactly what you're looking for. All right, now let's talk about some trends. And just because we're over 40, that doesn't mean that we have to ignore trends altogether. The key is being subtle and knowing what works for you. So here's how you can keep your wardrobe fresh without it looking like you're trying too hard. First, find subtle trends, right? So some trends are gonna be easier to work with. For example, the bomber jacket has come back in a really big way, and that jacket is timeless enough to look great at pretty much any age. Then we have things like quality knit pieces like polos and sweaters. In the last couple of years, those knit polos and sweater button polos have been super popular, and I've got some in my closet. I would just say to avoid like the trendy oversize baggy fits and go for solid colors instead of like really bright, bold patterns. All right, so here's another quick tip for you. If you wanna try something new, like maybe a sweater polo with buttons down the middle, try it as a single statement piece, right? Trying one piece at a time isn't gonna really overwhelm your look, and it's gonna be easier to adapt into your wardrobe that way. So if you wore say two trendy pieces at the same time, you might be uncomfortable doing it, and it might look a little bit too try hard. Just go for one piece at a time. Here's something else that I wanted to mention here, and it has to do with t-shirts. So everybody has gotten so casual these days, and it seems like t-shirts are just the standard practice for everybody everywhere. Try this though. Instead of grabbing a regular t-shirt, grab a Henley instead. Something like this Henley still reads pretty casual, but when you get closer, I mean, this is a really nice piece with interesting details. Okay, jumping back to jeans for just a second, look for some alternative options instead of wearing the same old blue jeans every day, everywhere. If you wanna stay casual, but maybe one notch up, go for a pair of chinos. The thing is, you can wear chinos exactly the same way that you would wear a pair of jeans. They just look a little bit nicer. You can go with the Henley and sneakers, or you can do like an untucked casual button down with boots and a bomber jacket. However, you would normally wear jeans is exactly how you can wear chinos. But the bonus with chinos is they tend to dress up a little bit easier, right? So throw on some nicer loafers and tucking your shirt, and you just elevated yourself to a whole different category. It's so simple. Now something else that I've been playing around with a lot this year is wearing dress pants out on like a Friday or Saturday night. So if I'm going somewhere or meeting some people or taking some folks out to dinner or going to a cocktail lounge to listen to some live music, every now and then, I like to put on a nice pair of dress pants, maybe some nice shoes, and just a simple shirt. It doesn't even require that much effort, but I would suggest that whatever shirt you wear, tuck it in. You can even do like a black t-shirt underneath like a gray V-neck sweater or maybe go with like a gray or navy blue pair of dress pants, and you will look like a million bucks. And nine times out of 10, you'll be the best dressed guy in the room without even barely trying. I'm telling you, you won't look like your grandpa. Pay attention to the fit and you'll look amazing. I do have a question for you though. Let me know down in the comments, what's one piece in your wardrobe right now that you feel represents you the best right now? I'm really curious.

        "transcript": " I get asked more about suits than almost any other question about men's wear. And it's sort of interesting because I really don't wear suits all that much anymore. I probably wear a suit maybe three to four times per year when it's needed. And that's the thing, right? If you're an average guy, you probably need to wear a suit maybe just a couple times per year. And during those times, you actually need a suit, right? Not some sort of half-ass attempt at trying to piece together a couple items to make it look like you're dressed up. Because when you need a suit, you need an actual suit. So in this video, we're talking all about suits, shirts, and how to get the right fit. And because I just mentioned fit, you guys, fit of your suit is everything. We talk all the time about, you know, nailing the fit of your clothes that you wear on a daily basis. But when it comes to a suit, amplify that by like 10. Because if your suit doesn't fit you, you can see it a mile away. And I know you don't want that. You can take a $5,000 suit and then a $500 suit and line them up side by side. Now, even though maybe the $5,000 suit might be made with better materials or something and have a fancy brand name on it. But if it doesn't fit you and the $500 suit does, you just wasted a ton of cash because fit is everything. And the less expensive suit is better period. The most common mistake that I see is men wearing suits that are just too big. So let's talk about a few key areas that you need to look at. First, the shoulders. The shoulders seem on the jacket should end right about where your natural shoulder ends. It shouldn't be too short and it shouldn't extend way out past your shoulder. Most guys though, are wearing suits that are at least one size too big. And this area is a dead giveaway. If the shoulders are too big, it just looks like you're wearing somebody else's clothes. Now let's talk about the body of the suit. And to simplify things, today we're only talking about a single breasted suit with two buttons. So button the top button and see how it fits around your stomach. Now it's okay that the jacket touches your body, but it shouldn't be so tight that the button pulls really hard on the fabric. Now you should have a slight gap between your stomach and the jacket. Again, it should be a slight gap, not a big giant one. You should not be able to take the jacket and pull it away from your body very far at all. If you can, the jacket's just too big. Now something else I want to make very clear, never button the bottom button of your jacket ever for the rest of your life. Always leave the bottom button undone. The jacket sleeve length should expose anywhere from a quarter inch to a half inch of your sleeve cuff when your arms are hanging straight down at your sides. If the jacket sleeves fall down past your shirt cuff and touch the back of your hand, they're just too long and they need to be adjusted by a tailor. The length of the jacket itself can sort of vary depending on the style of the suit, but generally speaking, it should be just long enough to cover your backside, but no more. Let's talk about the suit jacket vents. So these are those little slits that are cut in the back of the jacket. So you're probably going to find a single vent or a double vent. Now when you buy a suit or even a sports coat for that matter, nine times out of 10, these vents are going to be sewn closed with a little cross stitch. That little piece of thread needs to be cut and removed so those vents can open when you walk around and sit down. The single vent is a good option, but my preference is the double vent. It allows the jacket to not deform as much when you sit down. And in my opinion, it makes your butt look better. Now before we move on to the pants, because there's a lot of critical things to cover there, I want to let you know about the suit I'm wearing in this video. It's brand new and I just got it from thebillionairesuit.com. This is a custom suit that was made specifically for me. I went through the entire fitting process just like anybody else would and this suit is a home run. This is a very personal process that simply doesn't really even exist these days, especially at this price point. So when you buy a suit from billionaire suit, you work directly with the founder and designer, Gary Calone. And please forgive me if I mispronounced his name. He is the one who gives you a private one-on-one video sizing session to make sure your suit fits like perfection. Nobody else is doing this because I think the internet has just sort of made it all about those made-to-measure suits. So that human element is totally missing. This is a true bespoke process that Gary has digitized. So you get to have an upscale billionaire suit experience right from the comfort of your living room. Like I said, I had the same experience that you'll have and it was amazing. This is just some of what you're getting with your billionaire suit purchase. So after your sizing call with Gary, he will cut the one-off fabric for your suit so it can be made specifically for your body. Now the suit has a full horsehair canvas inner lining that will slowly mold to your body and improve the fit as you wear it more and more over time. The billionaire suit also has functional buttons on the sleeve cuffs known as surgeon buttons, which is typically only found on higher end suits that cost a lot more. Your name is also going to be hand embroidered on the inside of the suit jacket. That was a nice touch that I wasn't expecting. I just can't say enough about how cool the whole experience was and how knowledgeable Gary is. So there was one point when we were measuring on that initial call and we came up with a number. He was smart enough and experienced enough to know that that number didn't sound quite right based on our other measurements. So he asked us to measure it again and he was absolutely right. We were off by maybe like an inch or two because the tape measure just wasn't in the right spot. Gentlemen, I'm telling you if you need a new suit, get one that's made for your body and made extremely well. Go check out the billionaire suit.com at the link down below in the description. Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this entire process. Guys, go hit that link and schedule your fitting today. All right, let's move on to the suit pants. Now, something I discovered during my fitting was that I was wearing my suit pants a little bit too low. So what Gary told me was to take three fingers right below your belly button and at the third finger, that's your natural waist. That's where your suit pants should be. So as far as the fit goes around your waist, so your pants should fit snug enough to not need a belt. One of the signs of a well-made suit is the lack of belt loops on the trousers. Now, technically, you only really need to wear a belt if the pants don't fit you perfectly. So your pants should also have some type of adjustment method on the sides so your waistline can sort of fluctuate a little bit. Now, another sign of a high-end suit is grip material on the inside of your waistband. I love this stuff. It holds your shirt in place all day and all night. I'm telling you, this is absolute perfection. The fabric should drape nicely all the way down your leg and land right at the top of your shoe. Now, this is more personal preference, but in my opinion, go for either a no-break or maybe a half-break. Anything more than that just looks like you're wearing somebody else's clothes because the pants puddle and bunch up on top of your shoes and that's not a good look because, look, you spent all this time dressing up, putting on a suit. You don't want to have that ruined by your pants being too baggy and too long. Now, personally, I like suit pants with a flat front. I'm not really a fan of pleats. However, though, man, if that's something you like, if that's your thing, by all means, go for it. Just make sure they're not overly loose and baggy. Now, another personal preference is whether or not to use a cuff at the bottom of your pant legs. So one of my suits does have a cuff and it was just more of like a stylistic choice. Now, one thing that's kind of interesting about having a cuff down there is that a little bit of extra weight at the bottom of your pant leg helps to sort of pull the fabric downward and that helps the fabric drape a lot better. Now, let me chat about the color of your suit for a minute. So again, in my opinion, charcoal gray is probably going to be the most versatile and it would be my choice for a first suit or your only suit. It works for weddings, funerals, business meetings, formal events, Christmas parties, you name it. Charcoal gray just always works. Now, my second suit would be something like this in navy blue. Again, it works in a lot of the same situations that charcoal gray does, except for maybe some formal events and funerals. But look, from there, once you have those two, you can go light gray, tan, pinstripe, windowpane, whatever you want. But I just would encourage you for that first suit to stay somewhat conservative and go with charcoal gray and then go navy blue. After that, go nuts. Let's chat about shirts for just a minute. Dress shirts are the way to go. I would go with a traditional button up dress shirt and not something with a button down collar button down collar shirts are generally considered more on the casual side. Go with pure white, light blue, dark blue, and then maybe something with a stripe pattern like this. Now, this shirt is also from billionaire suit and it fits perfectly. He absolutely nailed the fit on this one. Something else he nailed perfectly is the vest or the waistcoat. I haven't mentioned this one yet, but we decided to go with the three piece suit, which of course comes with the vest. You can tell how well this was made for me because it doesn't have that cheap looking adjustment strap on the back. Now, we can't forget about the finishing touches like a pocket square. First things first, do not buy one of those matching sets that come with a perfectly matching tie and pocket square. Pocket squares are more personal and you can have a lot of fun with it. Now, they should closely match something that you're wearing in color tone, but it doesn't have to exactly match anything you're wearing. I really hope this video answers some of your questions, and if it did, please do me a favor and hit that like button because that helps more guys find this video that are looking for it. As always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well, and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " When you reach a certain age, and that age is different for everybody, but what you wear has different meaning than it did when you were a lot younger, right? You don't dress like a two-year-old when you're 42 or 52. And of course, you can wear whatever the heck you want, because at this point, you've earned it. But with that said, that doesn't mean that you get to use that as an excuse to stop caring about your appearance and how you present yourself. Because nobody respects the guy who just looks like he gave up on himself and doesn't care about himself. And the first part of being respectable is showing that you respect yourself. So in today's video, I'm going to show you a bunch of different ways to style jackets. Now, I'm going to be showing you everything from suede jackets to canvas jackets to matte leather jackets. Now, personally, as an older guy, it's my opinion that older gentlemen look better in suede and matte leather as opposed to something in a shiny leather. But if you like that, dude, I totally get it. Do your thing. But if you're looking for some outside perspective, something in a matte finish or suede looks more refined and a lot less like you're trying too hard to hang on to your 20s. Now, first up is this racer jacket in matte brown leather. Now, brown is an incredibly versatile color because it pretty much goes with anything. Now, I'm wearing it with a pair of brown boots, dark wash denim and a white polo shirt. You can easily go with sneakers and a t-shirt to be super casual. But I'm just trying to elevate things that little bit. Then I kept everything the same, but I swapped out the jacket for one of my all time favorites right now. This brown suede trucker jacket. The fit is great. The color is really nice. And the feel of the soft suede is pretty hard to beat. It's super comfortable. Now, dark denim is considered to be a little more dressy. So I wanted to dress things down just a bit and go with a more medium wash pair of denim and some suede chucka boots. Now, the boots paired with this jacket is a perfect match and then paired up with the medium wash blue jeans. I think this is something that pretty much any guy can pull off easily. And because it's November when I'm filming this video, the weather is starting to get a lot colder. So I added this burgundy quarter zip sweater as an extra layer. Blue, brown and burgundy. So those are all earth tones that work really well together, especially in the fall season. Again, super simple, super casual and something pretty much anyone can wear. If black is more your speed, I'd kept everything else the same except I changed the boots and the jacket. Now, technically, it's the same racer jacket as the first one I showed in this video. But of course, this one is matte black. It's actually really cool the kind of difference it makes just by changing the color of just a few things like the jacket and the boots. It just creates a whole different vibe. And really quick, before I get too far and start showing you all the rest of these combinations, I wanted to let you know that all the jackets in today's video are from Thursday Boot Company, who was nice enough to sponsor today's video. I'm a huge fan of everything Thursday is doing right now, including their boots, their sneakers, their dress shoes, and of course, their amazing jackets. Thursday is one of my all time favorite brands because they continue to offer the lowest direct-to-consumer prices on Goodyear Well boots, leather sneakers, dress shoes, and leather jackets, all made with premium USA leather. Everything is made with incredible quality, but you don't need to pay those crazy overpriced retail markups for high quality, amazing items that are built to last. I have several pair of Thursday boots, sneakers, and jackets that I've had for years now, and even after all this time, they still look and feel amazing. And I really do encourage you to go check out these incredible new jackets and everything else they make, like of course, their sneakers and their boots. They also, as a bonus, have some pretty nice items for women, so you might want to consider picking something up for her as well. Just go through that special link down below in the description box and go see everything they have because I promise you, you're going to find something that you absolutely love. Thank you Thursday Boots for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Okay, moving on to this really cool waxed canvas field jacket. So I kept everything exactly the same as my last look, except I swapped out the black racer jacket for this one in waxed canvas. It's got a really nice thick inner lining, and I just love the look of this jacket. I like it so much, I have another one in brown. So for this pairing, I went with olive chinos, and I went back to those suede chucka boots. And something else to note here, olive and burgundy are complementary colors that always look good together. So if you're ever curious, like what other colors you can wear with olive green, this combination works really well, especially right now in the fall season. Alright, I'm getting a lot of mileage out of this suede trucker jacket in this video, but it's seriously one of my favorite jackets right now. And the pairing with these suede boots is absolutely perfect in my opinion. And once again, olive with burgundy is an absolute home run, and I encourage you to give it a try. Alright, trying something a little different with this one. So I'm going with these gray suede Chelsea boots, navy chinos, a dark gray v-neck sweater, and the black field jacket. I actually like this a lot more than I thought I would when I was planning this out, and I think everything works really well together. From there, I went with these brown leather sneakers, and I went back to that suede trucker jacket. Now, this is obviously super casual, but at least in my opinion, it looks more elevated than just going with the standard t-shirt and blue jeans. Once again, blue and brown are opposite on the color wheel, so they're perfect complementary colors, especially this time of year when it's colder and we're all wearing earth tones. Alright, keeping everything else basically the same except for the sweater. So I swapped out the gray v-neck for this tan cashmere crew neck sweater. And because blue and brown go together so well, sometimes I'll play around with different shades of blue, but in this case, different shades of brown in the same outfit. And as you can see, I've got dark brown shoes, medium brown jacket, and a light brown sweater. I just think stuff like that adds more visual interest. Changing things up a bit now, we have gray suede Chelsea boots, tan chinos, a black fitted sweater, and of course that black racer jacket. All in all, it's a pretty simple outfit to put together, and I always like to look of black on tan. Once again, this is something that practically anyone can put together very easily and pull off very easily. For this next one, all I did was change the jacket back to that suede trucker jacket. Once again, I still have the black and tan overall vibe that I do like, but the two different shades of brown work nicely against each other. And I think that's the trick here, because if the brown tones were exactly the same, it would almost look like I'm wearing some kind of a uniform. The more difference there is in color tonality when you're wearing the same color, the better it all works together. Then I went with gray denim, black boots, a navy blue fitted sweater, and of course the black fuel jacket. You can see contrast right between the gray and the black, and the navy blue just adds a small element of color to an otherwise pretty plain outfit. But I think it works really well, and it's definitely something I would wear pretty often right now. I had to jump back over to the suede jacket and the chucka boots. And once again, this is definitely something I could see myself wearing this time of year quite often. The thing is though, it looks like a polished outfit, but it's super simple, right? It's just brown boots, a brown jacket and gray jeans, and of course the casual blue sweater. It's nothing fancy, but the colors work together, and the fit is on point. So if you enjoyed this or have any comments at all, let me know down below, and please consider subscribing if you're not already. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching, live well, and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " In today's world, the whole idea of a boys club has come a long way from what it used to be in the past, right? What used to be seen as just like a hangout spot for all these men who were trying to get out of that honey-do list is now, I believe, more of like a necessary way for men of all ages to connect, hang out, unwind, bond, and just have some fun together. And I think that now it's more about finding a group of guys to share some interest. So whether it's doing outdoor activities, playing sports, or just hanging out over a bunch of beers or maybe diving into any type of shared hobby, it's either a time or a space to connect in today's society where meaningful friendships can be very hard to come by. So why do we even need a boys club? With all the talk right now around mental health and being open and being more vulnerable, a lot of guys still feel that they need to stay stoic. And I don't disagree with that. That's just how I was raised. And that's kind of where the boys club comes in. It's a low pressure spot to just be yourself and enjoy the company. So unlike some female friendships that are all about sharing feelings, guy friendships tend to work best when there's actually something to do, whether it's cars, golf, hunting, or building something, activities make it easier for guys to bond without it feeling forced. Because that sort of gives guys a way to connect and feel understood without needing to spell it all out. It's just about having a healthy way to connect and unwind. Now when I use the term boys club, that doesn't necessarily mean a physical space where an actual club might be. I mean, it could be. But at least for me, it's just time set aside on a regular basis to go hang out and shoot the shit. And again, for me, that time is every Thursday. It's almost like this non-negotiable reserved time. I have even canceled and rescheduled some meetings that wanted to schedule with me on a Thursday. So in our Thursday group, we have had guys come and go in and out of our group over the last couple of years. To be honest, it's sort of a hard ticket to get. But for right now, it's right back where it all started, just me and my buddy Scott. So him and I have been getting together almost every Thursday for the most part for about the last three years or so. And it just sort of turned into a regular thing by accident. We have had some of the craziest conversations and we even started a podcast, I think last year, but the production sort of got in the way and it just put too much pressure on us, just being able to hang out and be ourselves. So this year, every Thursday, we decided to visit every single winery in Temecula in alphabetical order and do a wine tasting. Now there's a little better than 50-something wineries out here. And as of right now, we only have, I think, five left. There were some smaller sort of reservation-only places that we did skip. But for the most part, we hit all the major players this year. So let's talk about a few popular boys' club activities. And keep in mind. A lot of this stuff is sort of designed around relaxation, competition, and creativity. Any of the things I'm about to list out can help promote bonding and also help promote a sense of purpose and achievement. It can be anything from casual meetups to more elite activities where you can find high-status guys. If you're looking for more laid-back vibe, poker nights are a staple of the boys' club scene and have been for a long time. These nights are all about kicking back with some friendly competition, good food, good drinks, cigars, and plenty of stories and laughs. Poker nights are just a classic that just never goes out of style. And there's something about the energy of poker night that keeps guys coming back. Of course, along with the chance to hang out and talk a lot of trash in a relaxed setting. Now for some guys, though, poker is more than just a game because in higher circles, it's a way to network and make some moves and still sort of keep things casual. There are a lot of high stakes games that happen in private where the game sort of doubles as a chance to make some deals. And cigars just always seem to be a part of those nights, right? Now even if you're not a big cigar guy yourself, sometimes you just got to admit that every now and then it's pretty fun in a group setting, especially on poker nights. The other thing that can be difficult if you're not a cigar guy is like what to buy. And that's where today's sponsor, Best Cigar Prices comes in. They have literally everything you need for the inexperienced and the experienced. You can jump on their website right now and search by different brands that you may have heard of. You can choose by strength, whether you want it mellow or full bodied. You can choose what length of cigar you want. And also you can choose by origin. But to make it easy, I think the best bet is to go with the All Star Sampler Pack, which includes cigars from Monte Cristo, Olivia, Rocky Patel, Romeo Y. Julieta, and Alec Bradley. You can grab that Sampler Pack right now for only $24.99 and you also will receive a free cigar cutter, a $20 gift card, and of course free shipping on your entire order. Kick off your holiday shopping right now with this exclusive unbeatable package. And just so you know, Best Cigar Prices is 100% owned and operated right here on the USA and they have incredible deals like Daily Deals and their BCP Rewards Club. They also have a guarantee that they'll beat any price out there or they'll give you $10. There's going to be a link down below in the description where you can get one of those top rated 90 plus All Star Sampler Packs with that free cigar cutter for only $24.99. Take advantage of this deal today. The link is down below in the description. Now another activity is a shared love for cars, motorcycles, or really anything with an engine. This has always been part of the boys club world. Car culture gives guys a really cool way to connect and network. So whether you're fixing up a car or buying and selling cars or doing track days, car guys join car clubs or hit up car meets like cars and coffee on the weekends to be part of a community around their passion for cars. And I'm one of those guys. And for those with the means, owning luxury or exotic cars is of course a privilege. High end clubs like the Ferrari owners club along with Lamborghini, Porsche, and McLaren clubs, those all bring together guys who appreciate the prestige and performance of high end cars. So in the last year, I've done a few of these multi day rallies with some of these guys and it's just a really cool way to connect with people who are doing some really incredible things and reaching these major milestones. It's the cars and the experiences that bring all these guys together. And once you're in, you're in. And where else besides the car community, can you have direct access to some of these guys? There isn't many. Now another one that we just can't overlook is of course sports. Sports have always been a huge way for guys to bond and be competitive because being on the field or being on the court or even in the stands creates a sense of camaraderie where guys can blow off steam and enjoy some friendly competition. Weekend games of basketball, soccer, golf or tennis or softball get to be regular traditions and it gives everyone a chance to team up, compete and just do guy stuff. Now for the high status guys, sports like golf and tennis are going to be some of the most popular. Golf especially has a reputation as sort of the elite boys club hangout because business networking and socializing happen every single day. Top executives, business leaders and politicians, they all see golf as sort of this prime time to build connections, relax and just sort of get away from the stress of work. Outdoor adventure sports. The outdoors has a special draw for guys who want to sort of escape the noise of city life. So camping, hunting, hiking and fishing trips are classic boys club events. It lets men reconnect with nature and also rely on each other to get through that adventure safely. And for those with the resources, outdoor adventures can take on a whole different luxurious feel right? Think deep sea fishing or big game hunting in remote locations or exclusive skiing trips to high end resorts. It's that high adrenaline experience that a lot of these guys actually need to get their mind off daily life at work making top level make or break decisions. And of course while I do understand that the internet makes it a lot easier for guys to connect over shared interest in like online communities, I would still encourage you to either find something in person that already exists or create your own boys club activity where you can meet in person. I'm telling you man, dudes need other dudes that share similar interests and dudes also need to set aside time to connect with other guys so they can all reconnect and recharge. Seriously, even if it's just sitting around talking shit telling stories and having a couple beers, do what you can to make your own boys club just a regular thing. And I'm really curious what you guys think about this. So please let me know down below in the comments. And before you guys take off, please consider subscribing if you're not already. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " What are some of the best things that you can wear with jeans? The short answer is you can wear just about anything that you want But let me dig in a little deeper and actually show you some examples using some of the most common colors of denim like Blue gray and black now I might also throw in a few other colors like Terracotta tan and off-white just to mess around but first up the good old blue jeans I'm picking a nice middle-of-the-road pair of blue jeans that isn't too dark and isn't too light They fit really well and they don't have any major distressing like a bunch of rips and tears now Let's start with a simple t-shirt and sneakers even though I guess I'm not much of a t-shirt guy I do respect that it's obviously a pretty common look in today's casual society So I'm going with a black t-shirt and white sneakers now another option would be black sneakers Or maybe even some like black or dark gray boots now maybe from there you want to go with another layer no problem Grab a lightweight sweater and maybe even a bomber jacket and you have a pretty basic look. That's also nice and clean It's not complicated and pretty much anybody can pull it off now because I'm not much of a t-shirt guy I generally prefer something like a Henley or a polo shirt Just something that's just a little more elevated that doesn't look like pajamas So here I'm going with a darker shade of jeans and a blue Henley now This looks very similar to the last look with the t-shirt and jeans But in my opinion, I think this just looks a little more intentional and a little more elevated It just seems to have more class than just going with a standard t-shirt. Alright now Let's dress things up just a little bit once again going with a dark wash pair of jeans and a dress shirt and a casual pair of dress shoes Throw on maybe a suede bomber jacket and you are good to go now If you want to do something a little different go with a long-sleeve polo I'm filming this video in November. So the long-sleeve polo just seems appropriate and also If the kind of shoe I'm wearing isn't your thing Just go with a nice pair of brown boots And if you haven't noticed there's one style move that I'm doing that can be Kind of a big deal and if you haven't spotted it, it's okay But it's matching my sock color to the color of my pants now It doesn't have to be like this perfectly perfect Match or an exact match especially if you're wearing jeans But it should be still pretty close and my number one sock of choice are these as always from straight-up socks These are basically all I wear and my entire sock drawer is full of these now I've got a bunch in solid colors like this and I've got some in Argyle as well And now they have expanded their lineup with some all-new athletic socks For those of you who are active these new athletic socks are built to keep up with your every move ergonomically contoured for precise fit these socks are differentiated by left and right Foot designs to better match the natural shape of your toes Zoned cushioning on the bottom of these socks offers extreme cushioning for cloud-like comfort Mesh vents and advanced hydrophilic fibers work together to wick away moisture keeping your feet cool and dry during your workouts I mean let's face it We all wear socks on a very regular basis and straight-up socks uses proprietary silicone strips on the inside to keep your sock in place and looking good all day long Because if you're anything like me man I hate always having to reach down and tug up my socks during the day these Solve that problem while still being comfortable and very high quality this tiny profile of these little silicone strips Hold the sock in place instead of having to rely on really super tight elastic because that gets very uncomfortable These are made with moisture wicking at Pima cotton because it was this pilling It feels amazing and it always looks nice and smooth. They have a reciprocated heel for a better fit They also have smooth toe seams and a reinforced heel and toe for a lot longer wear Okay gentlemen There's gonna be a link with the discount code down below in the description the discount code is only good for a limited time So if you need to restock your sock drawer right now with some quality socks These are absolutely what you need so hit that link and go grab yourself a few pairs today before time runs out Okay, one more look with blue jeans before we go ahead and move on to a few other colors And of course you guys probably knew this one was coming and as to wear a sports jacket It's elevated, but it's also Sort of casual cool because the jeans just keep everything nice and grounded. I mean you don't look too serious You're not too buttoned up, but you're polished. You're mature and you're put together Let's try a few looks with light gray denim. So one of my favorite combos is going with a fitted black sweater Gray is super versatile So you can wear just about any color with it that you like but I tend to gravitate towards Darker color shirts you can go with white sneakers to keep things super casual Or you can even go with like a gray or a black boot Another option is a pair of brown shoes with maybe a nicer shirt You can also add some layers with a quarter zip sweater or even a cardigan If you want to keep things more casual just start with the plain t-shirt as your base layer But then add your sweater of choice on top of that. Alright now These are the closest thing I have to a pair of black jeans. So they're just gonna have to work for today's video All right, so generally for me when I wear Specifically this pair of jeans. I usually just go all black. I don't wear these that often But when I do I just go with black shoes and a black top I'll do something like maybe a black sweater a black jacket and of course some black shoes and like I said It's not something I do a lot But when I do this is how I like to wear black jeans now Let's move on to something a little more interesting like these terracotta jeans So I think these are great for the fall season because the color just works really well And it pairs up nicely with other earth tones now one way I really like wearing these is with the blue shirt and brown boots If it's a little bit cooler and maybe you want to do another layer go with the blue sweater in a darker shade Now something else that works really well is a black top and black shoes Now if you want to be simple once again, just grab a black t-shirt if you want to do something more elevated Grab a black Henley, maybe a black long-sleeve polo or a black sweater You can also go with the black jacket as your top layer for shoes Black sneakers black boots are gonna be one of my go-to options Okay, let's mess around with some tan jeans and see what we can come up with The first thing that comes to my mind is a blue shirt So go with the blue dress shirt or maybe a blue sweater now olive green is another nice option So maybe go with a t-shirt as your base layer and then the olive sweater on top now brown Sneakers or brown boots would be my choice with this combo You can also do a monochromatic look with a dark brown sweater and brown boots and To get all the style points and grab a brown jacket and you basically win Now let me show you something that a lot of guys might not normally do But I want you to consider it and that's off-white or cream colored jeans So I like creating contrast with some of the things that I wear and I also like wearing darker colors on my upper half With these jeans you can do just about anything you want You can basically do any type of sweater any type of casual shirt or dress shirt any color works But again, I like to keep the color tones a little bit darker But if this is something that you're doing in say the spring or summer you can absolutely brighten up those colors Let there sneakers work boots work loafers just about any type of footwear you can think of now It is Kind of a bold look because the pants are quite a bit brighter than something that you might be used to but again It's something that you should at least consider and try now something else You should consider is subscribing to this channel if you're not already and also hitting that like button to let the YouTube algorithm Know that I'm still alive and with that gentleman as always Thank you so much for watching live well, and I will see you in the next one"

But I guess the questions that you might want to ask yourself first is the why, the what, and the where, right? Why do you wanna work on self-development? What specific areas do you want to improve and where do you wanna start first? And then immediately after that, I think you need to accept and embrace your decision to improve yourself. It doesn't happen overnight. And you also need to understand that the journey itself matters. Self-development isn't just about reaching some goals, right? It's about becoming a better version of yourself. And even though I know that sounds sort of cliche, it's absolutely true because a lot of times when you really do the work, a year from now, you're almost a different person. It's also important to realize that this is almost like a lifelong journey and committing to making small consistent changes is crucial. You also need to accept that personal growth doesn't have an end date, right? And the sooner that you accept that, the easier it starts to get. And you will see changes start stacking up and that motivates you to do more. And because I'm mainly talking to men over 40 right now, let's reassess your physical fitness. Let's face it, staying fit over 40 isn't the same as it was when you were 20, right? But that doesn't mean that you can't be in great shape. And three areas to focus on would be strength training, flexibility, and cardio. Brand new research on the benefits of lifting weights is coming out like all the time right now. And what they're finding is that strength training is critical as you age. Not only does it help keep you strong, but it also improves your bone density. Focus on basic movements that target your major muscle groups, squats, deadlift, bench press, and rows. And like I've said before in other videos, if you're new to this, just please consider hiring a trainer to help get you started on the right path. But another area here is flexibility and mobility. I've talked about this before in some other videos recently, but one of the main reasons that older people need to move into convalescent care is because they can't get themselves on and off the toilet. So do regular stretching and mobility exercises that target your hips and your legs. Another important area is your grooming. So when you were a young guy in your 20s, grooming was sort of optional or non-existent, at least in my case. But by the time you're 40, it is absolutely an essential part of being the best version of yourself possible. And once again, things like haircuts and facial hair grooming are instant improvements. Keep your hair cut fresh and work with a barber who understands your hair type and how you like to wear it. Now, if you have gray hair, my advice would be to simply embrace it. But of course, if you wanna color it, dude, that's your choice and that's your preference. But men look more distinguished and elegant with a little bit of gray hair, or at least in my case, all gray. Now, one thing that I will recommend if you have gray hair like mine and you want a more silver tone to it, use purple shampoo like this about two to three times per week. The purple shampoo cancels out that weird yellow brassy tint that, in my opinion, looks like crap. You also need to keep your skin in check. And this might be the most important part of grooming right now as we get a little bit older. And the right skincare routine does not have to be complicated. You basically, you just need a few things. You need a high quality face wash, an exfoliating scrub, a moisturizer for the morning and before bed. And I'm sure you guys know by now that I use Tish Handley skincare products every single day because it works for me. And if it didn't, I wouldn't still be using it and spending my own money on it every single month for the last seven years. My advice, if you're just getting started, just get the level one system. You'll get the daily face wash, the exfoliating scrub, a morning moisturizer and a nighttime moisturizer. But if you want to level up a little bit and use the same stuff that I use, jump on that level three kit because it comes with all of those items I just mentioned, plus an anti-aging super serum and an eye solution to sort of handle those wrinkles around your eyes. And if you've heard me talk about Tish Handley before, but you still haven't pulled the trigger, now is the time because this November, Tish Handley is offering their biggest deal of the entire year exclusively for first time subscribers. And this isn't just a normal discount. So check this out. If you go grab their level one system that I talked about that's normally retail priced at $45, it is now only $23 when you become a member. That's just about half off the regular price. And this is the one time deal that you just won't see any other time this year. Plus throughout November, all customers can enjoy additional discounts on a wide range of their face and body products, which I think makes it the perfect time to stock up or pick up something new that you haven't tried before. You can pause, you can cancel or customize the items that you want to receive at any time. So again, don't wait. This deal is pretty much as good as it gets. Just click that first link in the description down below and go lock in the best deal of this year and get started on your skincare journey today. And because this is mainly a style channel, one of the easiest things that you can do to improve your appearance is to just upgrade your wardrobe. Wearing better clothes or even just clothes that fit your body better is an immediate change. You see the difference right away and it just, it does something to your self-confidence. When you look good, you feel good. And when you know you look good and people start to compliment you on how well you look, your self-esteem goes way up and it just snowballs into more improvements. The biggest mistake that men over 40 are making right now is just not paying attention to the fit of their clothes. Most guys are wearing baggy clothes. It just make them all look just old and dumpy. It's almost like these guys are moving through life, showing the entire world that they just don't care about themselves because that's how that looks. The goal should be a tailored look, not tight and not loose. So if you have some pieces right now that maybe fit a little bit too big, find a local tailor and just have those things adjusted. All right, you should probably also take a look at your diet and improve a few areas because nutrition gets a lot more important as we get older. Protein, make sure you're getting lean meats, fish, eggs, and also some plant-based proteins in your diet every day. This helps maintain muscle mass and it also helps recovery after your workouts. Make sure you're getting healthy fats. Fat is not your enemy, but of course, quality matters. So add healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. Omega-3s from fish, flax seed, and walnuts are also pretty great for your heart health. Cut out the junk. Limit sugar, processed snacks, and excessive alcohol. Now, this doesn't mean cutting out all that delicious wine from Dean Michael Wines, but just make sure you're having it in moderation. Now, this is where things get a little interesting because one of the more difficult parts of self-development is you eventually reevaluate your relationships. And this is just a warning, but the further along you get in your self-development journey, the more you start to notice some of your relationships that almost feel like dead weight. And these are the relationships that are holding you back because think about it. Improving yourself isn't just about looking better and feeling better, it's also about the relationships and the people who add positivity to your life, not useless negative drama. Do this, think about your current friendships and identify the people that are supportive and enjoyable to be around, but then also identify the people who always complain, drain your energy, and just drain your happiness. Now, you might also consider reconnecting with family members that maybe you've lost touch with. Maybe it's your parents, or maybe it's even your grown kids, or some siblings or relatives. A lot of times when you're on your journey, dedicating more time to these people can just give you a brand new feeling of connection. Something else you can do is to set clear goals and track your progress. Now, keep in mind, your goals don't have to be these huge monumental things and they're not etched in stone. You can modify your goals as you go along, but having clear goals helps keep you on track. So maybe your goals for this month would be getting out and exercising three times per week or going to the gym three times per week this month. Maybe it's just finishing that book that you started six months ago. Maybe it's the simple goal of going through your closet and getting rid of the clothes that you don't wear anymore or that no longer fit you. And do this, when you're in there, try a bunch of clothes on and make two piles. One to bring to the tailor and one to donate. Like I said, these don't have to be massive, monumental goals and you don't have to wait until new years to start. Start now. One thing that I wanna say here for the record and be very clear about is that self-improvement doesn't mean that you're fixing yourself because you're broken or that there's something wrong with you. That's not it at all. It's about just making deliberate choices that add value to your life. It's about increasing your self-respect and your self-worth. And also accept that you might come across some roadblocks and setbacks along your journey. But just remember that the road to a better you is hardly ever going to be a straight line. And really quick, before you guys take off, please make sure to go check out T-Shandley. The link is in the description and go grab the best deal of the year. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Alright gentlemen, today's video might get a little bit personal and I'm going to talk about some things All the way through the video from top to bottom and some of it gets a little personal So if you resonate with anything just please watch all the way through because What you specifically might need to hear might come towards the end So I was in a conversation with a few people at the gym the other day and my trainer Made a statement that sort of caught my attention and it went like this now He said that most men over 40 are Already acting as if they're half dead and he went on to say that guys like me and my buddy Scott who I Worked out with every week. He said that we are living our best lives and living life to the fullest And that kind of hit home for me because he's right Scott and I and possibly even you are in the minority and I'm not really sure why that is We this demographic are literally in our prime So why do most guys waste it if you watch my channel on a regular basis chances are that you're Trying to work on yourself, right and you're improving yourself But think about this Take a look at most guys, you know that are mid 40s or older How did most of these guys act do they look after themselves? What are they doing? Are they? Out there living life or are they sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos? So listen as a man Your self-worth is attached strongly to your purpose And there's a few key points about that that I want to make first is your individual goals and your individual self-improvement independent of anybody else right you should be working on something or learning something or Building something or trying to get to that next level of whatever it is you're trying to do because if you're not Your self-worth is basically non-existent and when that happens you Don't have any strong boundaries and you accept mistreatment and disrespect from other people now the second part of that is Being with someone who doesn't appreciate or respect your efforts because if you Work hard trying to provide for someone or do things for Someone else to make their life easier, but those efforts aren't appreciated that also attacks your self-worth because Why even bother doing those things it makes you feel useless with no self-worth and that is not okay It's tough and I know that I'm sort of generalizing and I'm not trying to crucify anybody for being lazy I'm not walking in their shoes. I have no idea what it's like to be that person but what I do know is There's an epidemic of men in this age bracket that have completely let themselves go prematurely and for me I Find that pretty sad because I know what it feels like on Both sides and the side that I'm on now is a heck of a lot better over the past couple years I have built myself into probably the most socially active person that I know and if you know me Personally, you know I've got a pretty big social circle. I'm proud of that and it's not uncommon for me to have some type of event to go to almost every single night of the week it might be a Dinner party get together it might be a concert it might be a food pairing event or it just might be a Taco Tuesday where a bunch of us get together for tacos and I guess my point is That it's a very big world out there and life is exactly what you make of it What's that saying it says that you have two lives and the second one begins when you realize That you only have one So basically what this means is that once you truly understand Truly understand how precious your life is You finally start living it to the fullest I've said this over and over but I want to say it again if you're sitting there in your mid 40s You're only half done. So What are you doing with the time you have left? It's never too late and you're never too old to make a change in your life or start something new And I don't really know why I'm sort of being all motivational today But I guess I just want every one of you to live your damn life in the best way possible and to not waste any of it Practically half your life up until this point you were still a kid and your parents made all your decisions for you But from the time you were basically 18 and for the rest of your life you get to make your own decisions good or bad And you'll have to live with those decisions and any of the consequences that come out of those decisions And the hardest part is always Taking that first step towards doing something better right to make positive changes in your life to start Respecting yourself more treating yourself better and making better decisions for yourself And one way to help make that first step a lot easier is to simply ask for help Reach out to the service that I trust and believe in better help today's sponsor Better help is a platform where therapists and their clients can communicate effectively and get the most out of therapy Better help is on a mission to make starting therapy a lot easier and with over 7,000 reviews and a 4.5 star rating on trust pilot better help is a platform you can trust I'm going to put a link down below in the description to betterhelp.com slash fashion Clicking that link will get you 10% off your first month of better help so that you can connect with the therapist and get Started on your therapy journey.

The link is right down below Thank you better help for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video now Let me get a little bit personal if you don't mind so I have recently gone through some relationship changes and on the outside everything's great But for a little while like things on the inside were super chaotic. I live All right, I live in a pretty small town and it's one of those communities where Because I know a lot of people everyone just kind of knows your business There was a lot of I guess outside drama that came my way and a lot of hurtful things were being said and it's kind of tough Right because all I've ever tried to do was take the high road and be a gentleman and be respectful But it's difficult when your character is being attacked But for me the only way that I know how to be is to just be myself, right? I'm genuine. I'm respectful I care about people. I have manners and I have boundaries I guess it just comes with the territory right because the more people you know the more people know you and know about your personal life I guess you just take the good with the bad I suppose but during difficult times you also find out who you can and can't trust and it's tough because I've had to let some people go recently that I thought were pretty solid but again this all gets back to Navigating your life and making the best decisions that you can make but also Understanding that your decisions might have unwanted repercussions and as you already know, that's just part of life There's no winners and there's no losers. Your life is your life. Nobody else's There's no competition with anyone except yourself be better than you were yesterday or last month or last year Know the difference between right and wrong and make decisions based on knowing that difference Always treat people with respect develop your self-worth and self-respect until your boundaries Actually mean something and become non-negotiable Let me circle back to the top of this video and just say that if you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, please Maybe just let this video be some motivation that you need and go live your life I'm 55 years old and I'm living a damn good life That doesn't mean though that I don't get stressed out about certain things like finances and starting a brand new wine business, but You take the good with the bad. I'm out there every single day showing that it's possible. I'm Enjoying my life enjoying the people around me. I'm being generous I'm being courteous and I'm doing what I can to help other people. I Enjoy great food great wine great music great friends and of course great exercise And that's a whole another part of this whole thing and it's getting Yourself healthy and to stop letting yourself go believe me when I say that every single day is a Reset and a brand new opportunity To show up to give your best and get one step closer to achieving your goals And if you want to make changes in your life Do it now man. Don't wait until new years like everybody else Just focus on the things that you can control and you will see the needle start to move I promise and really quick gentlemen before you take off It would mean a lot to me if you could just take a second and hit that like button to let the YouTube algorithm know that I'm still alive and with that gentlemen as always. Thank you so much for watching Live well, and I'll see you in the next one"

        "transcript": " It has been a few months since my last Q&A video and I absolutely love doing these and you guys seem to like watching them as well. So just to sort of get started here, all of the questions that come in are from Instagram. So if you don't follow my Instagram and you wanna be involved in some of these Q&A videos, the link is down below. Just go follow me and I will put out some Instagram stories when I want to receive a lot of your questions and make videos just like this. Like I said, I love doing these. So there's a lot to talk about. So let me get right into the first question. Would you film your current morning and night routine? I have done, I think I've done two morning routine videos. I haven't done any nighttime routine videos. The thing is they change all the time. Like I don't really have a specific productivity morning or nighttime routine. I just sort of roll out of bed. I come out here and make coffee. I catch a little bit of news and then I go in the office and start working. Now some mornings I get up, have coffee, take a shower and then sit down to film. Other mornings I'll get up, have coffee and go in my office and write. So I might not take a shower and sort of like get fully dressed and ready until like one or two in the afternoon. So it does kind of vary. Maybe I'll do like a day in the life video. Maybe would that be interesting? Let me know. What's your age? You're killing it brother. Well, first of all, Indie Jeep 24. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I do try. I'm 55 years old. That sounds crazy to say out loud, but yeah, 55. I turned 55 in April. I'm a 1969 baby. Yeah, so isn't it weird? I was having this conversation with somebody not too long ago and like it's weird to think back when we were kids, right? In our like, you know, mid teens and we looked at people and we knew people that were like, you know, in their 40s or even 50 and it was like, they're so old. I don't feel, I just don't. It's so funny. I still feel amazing. I feel great and I think in a lot of ways I still kind of feel like I'm just getting started. There's still a lot left to do. I'm motivated. I've got energy and yeah, yeah, it's not old. It's not old. It's up here, I think. And maybe in some cases, your joints and bones, but otherwise I feel pretty good and thank you very much. Daniel has a really interesting question. He's asking, have you ever turned down sponsorships or endorsements? And if so, why? Every day, every single day, there's people in my email that want to do a brand deal. However, most of them are spam or it's not something that I'm like on board with. I say no because it's not relevant to this demographic. It isn't relevant to me and it isn't something that I would generally use myself. Here's the thing though, hair loss. I've done brand deals for Bosley and Roman. These are hair loss companies. I don't use hair loss products, right? So why would I endorse them? Because someone out there might. I mean, this demographic, think about it, over 40 might be losing your hair and you might want to do something about it. So why, just because I'm not into it, that doesn't mean that you're not going to be into it too. So yeah, I say no to stuff all the time. However, on that topic, since I'm sort of talking about it, have I taken stuff that I feel guilty about? Yeah, I have. I've done that I think twice now and every time it just feels dirty. But again, it's one of those things that just because I wouldn't necessarily use it, that doesn't mean that somebody else wouldn't want to, right? So it's always this push and pull. Look, I've been super transparent about brand deals. It's how I can do this full time. It's actually the only reason I can do this full time. I've released income earnings reports on YouTube every single year for the past, I think two or three years in January or February. I release income reports. So I try to be super transparent with sort of where money comes from and how much YouTube actually pays me. So anyway, yeah, I turn down stuff all the time, but it is a balance. Sometimes I get it wrong and I hear about it in the comments and I totally understand that, but it's just, it's what I gotta do. So anyway, I appreciate your question. There's a lot to unpack with that one. All right, Jeff is asking, are you going to do a fall outfit submission video for us to send in our photos? Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to find a hole in the schedule to be able to make that happen. Keep an eye on the Instagram. One more reason to follow my Instagram. That's where I'll put a call out. I'll make an Instagram story like, hey, I'm doing the outfit critique video. Send your photos in now. So keep watching, Jeff, I'm sorry. I know I said October, but October's not over yet. I think I might, early November, let's shoot for early November. Do you have any repercussions from hernia surgery? No, no, it's actually been pretty good. If you guys don't know, there's a video on my channel where I had some hernia surgery. When was that? Earlier this year, months ago. I don't know how long it's been. No, everything's been good. What is the most safe color for a wedding suit? Groom or groomsman? Are you in the wedding? Are you a guest at the wedding? That kind of a thing? I would say, it depends, right? Colors are a big deal. If you're a groom or groomsman, you kind of don't have a choice. If you're going to a wedding, Navy blue, charcoal gray, it kind of depends on the situation. Is it a church wedding? Is it a black tie? Is it a beach wedding? It kind of matters, right? If you are getting married and colors aren't really a thing, right? Just wear a nice suit. Again, charcoal gray, navy blue, you just can't go wrong. Navy blue over like a royal blue, royal blue. I'll try to put some colors on screen, but royal blue tends to be a more youthful color, a more daytime color, a more outdoor wedding color. And if that's, if you're doing an outdoor wedding, that could be super great. But anyway, navy blue, charcoal gray, those are the two safest. All right, D is asking, what is your latest project? D, I'm disappointed, dude. You don't watch my videos clearly because you would know that I'm starting a new wine business and it's going really, really well. So there's a lot of questions about the wine business. So let me just take a minute to answer a couple of these questions and sort of group this all into one. How's the wine business going? It's going great. Clearly we haven't launched yet. I'm hoping for Thanksgiving this year, 2024. If not Thanksgiving, first part of December. It needs to launch in December at the latest. Price point of your wines. Great question. And actually a very timely question because just had a meeting over the weekend and my costs are surprisingly going to go down a little bit. So initially I was thinking, I still need to do the math and run some of the numbers. But basically we were going to be like $40, $50 per bottle price points, but now I think, I think we can get down to like the $30 to $40 per bottle price. I need to do some math. I got to figure some things out. There's still some stuff out there that I need to account for. But that's what I'm shooting for. I want this to be attainable. I want it to be affordable. But on the other hand, it's premium. And I'm paying a premium myself. So these are going to be amazing wines. They're from San D'Agn\u00e8s Valley in Central Coast, California. I've talked about that a lot. I just made a video the other day. If you watch this video on the day it comes out some Monday, a few days ago, I made another video talking about the varietals and which ones I'm launching with when we do launch. So I will link that video down below. Go watch that one to learn a little bit more. And Dan is asking, what's the best way to order your wines once they're on the market in November or December? Really happy for you. Dan, dude, Dan's OG, dude. Thank you so much for the support. Everything is going to be online at this point. So initially I'm launching online. The website's being built now. I've already written copy for it. I did, interestingly enough, I was at an event and I sat next to a guy. We started chatting. He's a beer and alcohol, he's a spirits distributor. Beer, liquor, wine, the whole thing. And so we started talking and we connected on a few different things, which was really interesting. And so he was like, dude, we got to do something. I was like, well, how does somebody like me, starting this brand, get into a distributor? So we talked a little bit about that. And he's like, man, he goes, John, when you're ready, let me know. So yeah, if it's in a distributor, we could be in restaurants, we could be in retail. We'll see. This is all next level type stuff. But initially, Dan, it's all going to be online. What's up, Fernando? He's saying, just saying hi and wishing you the best on your upcoming business journey. Cheers. Cheers, thank you very much. I appreciate the support. I know you're a car guy, ever try motorcycles. No, and here's why. I like motorcycles. I've always liked motorcycles. I just never grew up around bikes, right? My dad didn't ride. None of my aunts and uncles rode. One buddy of mine had a bike, but I was never, I was never around them enough to learn to ride. And I would still hop on one and kind of question myself. I think I know the gear. I don't know how to ride, basically. I know where the gears are and how they go up and down and all that stuff, but I'm embarrassing myself. I just never was around bikes, and it just wasn't ever really a thing, but I definitely appreciate them. All right, two sort of similar questions. Favorite wines and bourbons for fall, and then what are your recommendations for a good cigar whiskey bourbon pairing? When it comes to bourbon and spirits, I'm not an expert. So I will say, if I'm gonna go somewhere and have, say, an old-fashioned, or just like a whiskey neat with maybe a big rock in it, I will go for rye whiskey. I tend to gravitate towards rye whiskey more than bourbon. I don't know why. I think it's smoother for me. It's a little bit sweeter. It just goes down easier. It's not as bitey and as harsh as some bourbons that I've had. Not to say there isn't some amazing bourbons out there, but rye whiskey, for me, it just sort of does it. And as far as cigars, I'm not an expert there either. I do smoke cigars on a somewhat, kind of not regular basis, but occasionally. And I just go down the hill to the smoke shop and just grab a bunch of cigars. I think I'll buy like four at a time. Yeah, I just kind of look around. I try to find some that are like medium body and some robustos, but yeah, I just, I'm not an expert. I just kind of like what I like and I try different things and that's kind of it. Sort of a two-part question. Would love to hear your thoughts on tattoos. Fashion we can't alter as we age. I'm not sure what you mean by that second question, but let me sort of talk through it. Tattoos, I do not care. I've got one. I got this 20 something years ago. It's my only tattoo. I left racing. A lot of you guys know I raced cars for about 10 years. Got out of it after I won a championship in 2006. This goes, this is up in Seattle. 2007, I sold the car, sold everything. Sold the trailer, everything. And I got a tattoo in, I think I got this in 2007 just to sort of commemorate the racing career that I had. It's super ghetto. Would I do it again? Yeah, would I do something different? As far as the design, absolutely. It is pretty ghetto. I get it. I've got no problems with tattoos. I get comments. If I wear a shirt like this in a video, people comment about how crappy that looks. I don't see it as a thing. I really don't see it as a thing. If you have visible tattoos on your face, your neck, your hands, things like that, I think that's when things can go a little sideways, depending on your career and what you want out of life. If you're a young guy, if you're a teen's early 20s and you're getting visible tattoos, I think that might be a mistake. But I think you just have to know that that's permanent. It's cool when you're 19 and 20 to have tattoos everywhere because you see it on all the rock stars. But later in life, I think it can come back to bite you potentially, potentially. Depends on what you want to go do. But I think to play it safe, make sure they could be covered up. That's just my opinion, just my opinion. But I like tattoos. I don't mind them at all. A lot of buddies of mine have a lot of tattoos. My buddy, Sean, is almost completely covered. And he looks like a badass. That's what makes Sean Sean. I've got no problem with that. My buddy, Dave, from England, his whole arm is done. And he looks cool. It's part of who he is. And I think it looks really cool. Just my thoughts on that. I really don't care. The other part of your question. Fashion we can't alter as we age. I don't know what you mean by that. Is that my mind goes to trends. And we probably shouldn't chase trendy trends. I don't mind going after some of the things that are trending. For example, the button, the sweater polos. I wear those. They're super cool. The knit polos and stuff that are coming out. Side adjuster trousers are making a huge comeback. I love those things. But I'm not gonna do that ultra baggy, like that super loose fit trend that seems to be happening. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna chase that. The big chunky shoes, I'm not doing that either. I like to keep things for me, for me. And what I like to talk about is classics, right? Things that will or at least have the potential to be timeless, but that are trending now. Like those polo shirts I wear all the time with the buttons down the center and like a thicker fabric and the knit polos. I love those things. They're fantastic. I think those have like a long runtime. The same thing with the side adjuster trousers. Like I love that. I've got a few pairs of those. I don't wear them enough, but when I do, like they're awesome. Those might have a shorter runtime, but still it's a classic piece. And that's, I think, where I like to live is in those timeless classics, such a cliche thing, timeless classics. But it just works, man. It just works. And anyway, I hope that answers your question. Really quick though, two Instagram accounts that I want you to make note of. One is mine, so you can be sort of kept in the loop as to when I do call outs for these types of videos. Let's send me questions. And also send me the outfits for the outfit critique video that's coming soon, Jeff. And also the Dean Michael Wines. That's my wine brand that's coming. I'll leave those down below. Go follow both of those accounts if you wouldn't mind. So you can kind of stay in the loop as to when this wine is going to be launched and released. I would appreciate that. Anyway, gentlemen, thank you to every single one of you who submitted questions. I really appreciate it. I couldn't get to all of them. But yeah, thanks again as always. As always, I love doing these. Thanks guys. Have a great day."

        "transcript": " What's happening everyone? I wanted to I felt compelled to just sort of throw the camera up here and Just give a little update on the wine brand I know some of you are super interested in this and I know some of you aren't and like I said I'm not trying to spam this channel with that new business that I'm doing but I want to just chat a little bit about What was sort of going on and this is this will be a pretty quick video last night was an amazing night It was this milestone evening where I Had a lot of close friends with me and we were all tasting through sampling and approving Wines for the new wine brand and as you guys know If you don't know I'm starting a new wine brand called Dean Michael wines Dean Michael was my older brother who committed suicide when I was a teenager So this is the way to sort of give back and Help bring his name back to life and also part of the proceeds will go towards Suicide prevention programs and men's mental health organizations things like that So there is a big give back with this whole thing that I'm doing so last night last night We went through and tasted through Seven different varietals now. These are all going to be single varietal wines And so it's interesting Single varietal is like a whole different animal right because blends you can blend out a bad vintage, right? You can blend something out that might not be ideal Single varietal you can't hide anything. So these are powerful wines. I'm telling you guys you're gonna I Was blown away last night. We were all around this table. We have seven wines to taste through holy cow They were so good. They were so good And I'm so glad that I had a group of people with me to you know bounce things off of and these are people I respect You know their their palate and it was a really good time. We we really enjoyed it I made a bunch of notes on my phone. So I wouldn't forget the flavor profiles So I can sort of recall them, you know today and tomorrow and next week, but I landed on four different wines. I'm going to launch with now Initially, it was gonna be two wines a white and a red Great great way to sort of launch a brand Then it was gonna be three because I couldn't decide and so It ended up being four I could not Leave out some of these amazing wines that I tried last night It was we played around with the idea of like holding something back or like, you know Building hype for one of these ones that are gonna be coming down the pipeline and it was like Why let's just launch now with with four different varietals So there's gonna be two whites and two reds. So let me just let me tell you what they're gonna be I teased it on my Instagram story So there's going to be a sauvignon blanc. There's going to be a Chardonnay There's going to be a Pinot Noir and a Cabernet Sauvignon everything I tasted through Was next level and so Santillanes, that's where all this that's where all these grapes are from that's where the farmland is in Santillanes Central Coast, California, which is the ideal climate for growing wine grapes A lot of you guys know I live in Temecula, California southern California. It's hot here. We do have a wine region here. It's amazing It's it's it's favors the warm temperature Wine like we can't grow Pinot Noir here because it's too hot the grape just doesn't really work. It sort of falls apart It's too hot the Pinot Noir I Had last night was phenomenal it's If if you don't like so here's the thing there's a Chardonnay and a Pinot Noir Those are both somewhat controversial and not really you either like them or you don't like them, but here's the thing Chardonnay first I'm not a Chardonnay guy. I don't like the Napa Valley Butter bomb oak bomb that is Napa Valley Chardonnay, right? I just not my thing. I don't really enjoy that This Chardonnay is Neutral oak and then they add a little bit of oak flavor You know, they'll sort of taste it as it sort of progresses in the barrel Neutral oak doesn't really impart a lot of that butter that vanilla oak flavor in Chardonnay that Chardonnay is known for But you can add a little bit right you can sort of Strategically add more and more until it gets to the point where you like it. So if you're not a Chardonnay guy or woman You will love this Chardonnay. You absolutely will love the Chardonnay. It's right in the middle, right? It's sort of like a Pinot Grigio meets Chardonnay They had a baby and this is what sort of came out because it's got just enough oak on it And and you can smell it like that's a Chardonnay when you get your nose on it, but when it hits your palate it doesn't Bite you it doesn't overwhelm you it doesn't coat your mouth with butter, right? Anyway, so that's that's gonna be an amazing one. The other one is the Pinot Noir now I'm I like I like Pinot Noir. I like that funky Sort of moldy musty mushroom flavor that you get from a Pinot Noir I think I just it's a characteristic that I really really latch on to and I like that a lot You get that a lot with like Pacific Northwest, right? That's a whole different climate region up there, California Pinot Noir At least Central Coast is Nice and clean you get a little bit of that Musty funk that Pinot Noir is known for but it's clean. It's light. It's bright I would say and It just it fits that bill again It's right in the middle if you don't like Pinot Noir because you've had it and it has that really musty funky Flavor to it and smell so you like I don't like Pinot Noir. This will change your mind. This will absolutely change your mind the Sauvignon Blanc Typical California Sauvignon Blanc. It's amazing. It's clean. It's crisp. It's fruity. It's floral It's everything you love about a Sauvignon Blanc the Cabernet Sauvignon this Cabernet is I Had to look it is a I couldn't remember it's a 2022 cab so it's young on The nose you can smell right away that it's young you get a lot of that sort of that alcohol burn in your in your nose Once you sort of get your nose on it So it's although it's young it's still ready to go It's ready to go now and even a month from now or six months from now a year from now It's gonna be amazing So I would encourage you if if you're a if you're a Cabernet Sauvignon lover California region specifically Central Coast It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal I would almost say get two bottles drink one now and sit on one lay it down for a year and drink it next Christmas or next Thanksgiving or something like that I don't know hang on to it, but it is only gonna get better and I don't know how quickly we're gonna run through some of this stuff, but I just I'm I'm gushing and I'm rambling a little bit because I'm so excited you guys I'm so I'm excited last night was this milestone night and we all had a great time I'm glad like I said that I was you know around a lot of friends To sort of help me choose and you know give me their opinions. We had a lot of talk about wine last night and it was really fun So anyway, that's That's kind of where I'm I'm at we're we're almost there with labeling. We're so close Now it's just a matter of I have to spend a bunch of money to get labels approved through the state of California Times four so there's gonna be some costs associated with that But after that's done, I think that takes a few weeks So now is when things sort of get moving right the the web web development stuff needs to start happening I've already written copy. I need to Solidify some wine names now that I know I'm launching with four I need to put a name on every single one and then check trademark to make sure no one else has that So there's still a lot that has to happen What am I doing? I'm doing a charity event in San Marcos On the November 15 16, I can't remember what the date was but that's gonna be super cool black tie gala a lot of influential people I'm gonna have some wine there. It should be really good time Anyway, that's the update. Thanks for listening. I know this is not a normal 40 over fashion video, but It's something that's going on sort of behind the scenes and I wanted to let you know about it and get you excited because it's happening It's and it's it's getting real. It's getting really real and I could not be more excited So thank you for your support.

        "transcript": " Let me talk for just a minute about this whole comfort versus style debate because for the record, I just don't really understand it Okay, so for me anyway, my normal day-to-day style is what I like to call casual up to like a polished casual But here's the thing. I don't normally wear suits and sport coats, but also I don't wear Sweat shirts hoodies t-shirts and flip flops either Basically live in blue jeans just as much as the next guy and I prefer comfortable sneakers over a dress shoe But I also know when and how to dress things up if of course I need to but having said all of that You could still put me in a category of somebody who dresses very well and of somebody who is pretty stylish But when it comes to comfort if any of the components that I wear on a daily basis was Uncomfortable there's no way I would ever wear it. There's lots of different directions We can go from here But let's go towards fabrics first because I think a lot of it comes down to fit and Fabric now fit might be the most critical when it comes to dressing well and still staying comfortable But prioritizing quality fabrics is kind of where I sat natural materials like cotton Bamboo silk and wool are all very breathable and adapt pretty well to your body temperature fluctuations But here's something else t-shirts are arguably more comfortable than a dress shirt But is it really though like what about a t-shirt? Makes it more comfortable. Is it because it doesn't have any sleeves? Is it because it's more stretchy? Is it because it's just lightweight? Because there are a lot of very high quality dress shirts on the market right now that Just might be everybody's comfortable as a t-shirt and just for the sake of argument. Let's consider this So that one time nine years ago when you had to go wear a dress shirt for that wedding that you were in so you went out and bought the Cheapest dress shirt you could find it was made with very low-end material that felt kind of crunchy against your skin It wasn't breathable and it really didn't stretch and move with you at all Because you got that cheap one. That's the experience that you're basing your current opinions on That experience doesn't reflect all dress shirts. I'm just saying okay now Let me talk about shoes for a minute because obviously What you wear on your feet is a pretty important component of your overall outfit and picking the right shoes Does make a really big difference in your overall comfort and how stylish you look But another extremely important part of your footwear is adequate support and cushioning Now of course your running shoes might give you like super incredible comfort and support But the trade-off is of course style because While running shoes can be nice for running shoes That's just kind of where it stops exercise footwear or running shoes They just aren't stylish in any other environment other than exercise environments But these dress sneakers from today's sponsor Bruno mark are extremely comfortable and supportive now These are the Bruno mark max flex dress sneakers and Truth be told when I first got these I took them right out of the box And I just wore them around the house for a little while and right away I'm like yep. I totally I totally get it. They're super lightweight and they're extremely extremely comfortable You could literally wear these all day long and not worry about how your feet might feel towards the end of that day These are seriously that good now keep in mind. These are not trying to be dress shoes But they are trying to be dress sneakers that give you all-day comfort Supreme cushioning shock absorption and anti-slip properties and of course maximum comfort and here's something else and it may or may not be Important to everyone of you out there watching But I know it might be important to maybe just a few of you the way these are built They give you like two to three extra inches of height and it's kind of funny because when I was wearing these around the house I walked into my office and stood at my desk to check some email And I've got one of those motorized sit stand desks and when I walked up to my desk I had to raise it up a couple inches because these shoes made me a few inches taller and it was definitely Noticable so if you are interested in grabbing a pair of these shoes for yourself Don't wait on this deal because this offer is going to expire on the 31st of October And that's just about in two weeks now I'm gonna leave a few links down below in the description as well as a discount code That's gonna save you guys some cash once again though this offer ends in about two weeks on October 31st so once again don't wait on this deal All right something else to consider when you're deciding whether to prioritize comfort or style or hopefully both is The fit of what you're wearing and like I said before fit is The most important element when it comes to being stylish and and also staying comfortable Clothing that's too tight restricts your movement and makes you uncomfortable But also clothing that's too loose or oversized not only makes you look sort of sloppy But it also you have to sort of adjust and tug at everything to get it to fit right and that's also uncomfortable now Of course, I do understand that that oversized fit is trending in that younger demographic But in my opinion, it just still looks pretty bad right? It looks like these guys are just wearing somebody else's clothes, but again, that's just my opinion Well-fitting clothes are well-fitting clothes everything else just doesn't seem to work out very well And it's also trendy trends are here one day and gone the next now something else to really consider is Having enough versatile pieces in your wardrobe that are able to be dressed up or dressed down for example Consider medium wash blue jeans They go with practically anything from say a t-shirt and sneakers to boots in a blazer and again They should fit you really well and also have some modern fabric technology with some stretch built in So the blue jeans with that t-shirt can take you to get wings and watch the money night game But now let's swap out the t-shirt for a comfortable polo shirt or a casual button-down with a nice comfortable pair of like boots or loafers and now you're ready to sip cocktails at date night and of course another Really big factor here is of course mindset Because if you're not comfortable wearing loafers, you won't be comfortable wearing loafers No matter how comfortable loafers actually are and I totally respect that But if you're at a point in life where you want to start making changes and dressing better than you have been These are just some of the things that you're gonna have to face and overcome You don't have to go from zero to a hundred all at once But try things and make small changes and let that snowball into more changes and for the record I know that I'm not gonna reach all of you with this one video today But I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that you don't have to sacrifice Comfort for style because it is 100% Possible and very easy to find stylish pieces that are still comfortable and one more time gentlemen If you want to score a great deal on these shoes I'm gonna leave a few links with that discount code down below in the description and with that said gentlemen as always Thank you so much for watching live well, and I'll see you in the next one"

        "transcript": " In my opinion, sweaters are one of the most versatile items that you can have in your wardrobe. And I don't really think they get the credit they deserve, right? I mean, they're comfortable, they keep you warm, they work for casual weekends and also some formal occasions. And because there are so many choices and styles in sweaters, they can easily add another element of style to your wardrobe. I'm going to talk about V-necks, quarter zips, cardigans, and also sweater blazers. But let me start out with the standard V-neck. The cool thing about a V-neck sweater is the versatility. The V-shaped neckline lets you do a lot of different layering options, but it can also be worn all on its own very casually. Now, here's a few different ways you can wear it. With a dress shirt, now this is great for business casual or just for a more polished look. The V-neck allows the collar of the shirt to be visible and that gives the overall outfit a really sharp and polished look. Now, you can also add a tie to make things a lot more formal, especially if you're maybe heading off to a business meeting or a nicer dinner. Classic shirt color options would be white or light blue. You can also layer this whole thing under a blazer or a sports jacket. And this is really a perfect smart casual look because the combination works perfectly for just about any situation. We all ran into those occasions from time to time, right, that aren't super casual but also aren't super dressy. So this, I believe anyway, is a perfect combination when you still want to make a good impression like maybe on date night. You can also wear this sweater all on its own if you want a more casual vibe. Now, it's going to be a more minimalistic look and it's perfect for weekends or casual situations. With that said, though, I wouldn't go too casual and I would still go with a fitted style to avoid any type of oversized, bulkier baggy look. Pairing up a V-neck sweater is going to be very simple because you can do just about anything you want. Jeans are going to be a great option because they're easy and casual. You can do anything from light wash denim all the way to dark wash. Now, chinos are going to be one step up from jeans and these are going to give you a nice smart casual look or I guess how I like to call it sometimes is polished casual. Now, three colors of chinos I would go with would be tan, navy and gray. Now, some of my favorite sweaters are going to be the quarter zip or sometimes these are called the half zip. Now, these are obviously similar to a V-neck but as you can see, there's going to be more detail with the zipper area and of course, this type of sweater has this soft collar and this sweater in particular that I'm wearing is from collars and coat. This thing fits like perfection. It's lightweight and it's comfortable especially if you paired up with one of their dress collar short sleeve polo shirts. Now, something else that fits like perfection is their new Maverick blazer. You can literally roll this thing up, put it in your carry-on and when you take it out, it'll have virtually no wrinkles. The fabric on this is stretch and it's amazing. I've mentioned collars and Colby 4 in other videos and you probably already know about their dress collar polo shirts that always look fantastic. But if you have not been to their website in a while, you've got to go check it out because they have some really cool brand new pieces. They've got of course, these lightweight quarter zip sweaters and also this heavier one with the button closure that I love for the colder weather. They also have some really good looking knit sweater blazers that I will talk about in just a minute. But they also have outerwear, pants, shoes and basically everything you need to expand your wardrobe from head to toe day to night. There's going to be a link down below in the description to a special offer that's going to get you a discount on anything that you want to go pick up. And I really do encourage you guys to go surf around their website and to see all the new stuff they have because I'm sure you're going to find something that you like. Hit that link and go check out everything they have. Thank you Collars and Co for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Now, pairing up a quarter zip sweater is going to be very similar as a v-neck. Once again, you can wear it on its own for a casual look or you can wear it over just a regular t-shirt. Adding a collar underneath though, elevates the look a little bit so an easy pairing would be over just a polo shirt like this. Keep the zipper open to make sure you see sort of all the layers underneath. This is great look for the office or even a lunch date. Also think about wearing it under a jacket, right? Think about maybe a suede bomber jacket or even a pea coat. Now, obviously that extra layer is going to keep you a lot warmer, but it's also this additional style component that can complement everything else you're wearing. Here's something else to think about when it comes to color matching v-neck sweaters and quarter zips. Earth tones like olive green, tan and navy blue always work really well with casual outfits. But not only that, but those color tones can also be matched up with a lot of different shirts from, say, neutral colors to subtle patterns like small stripes and checks. But if you want to stand out a little bit, bold colors are great for casual looks. Colors like bright red, cobalt blue and even mustard yellow can add a lot of energy to what you're wearing. But just keep the rest of the outfit very simple and muted to let the sweater stand out on its own. And once again, pairing up quarter zip sweaters with pants is going to be very simple, right? Because just about anything works. Dark wash jeans all the way up to light wash jeans are going to work great for casual situations. But if you want to go with, again, a more smart casual look, go with chinos. All right, cardigan sweaters are another one of my favorites. Now, you're generally going to see these with buttons, but they do also come in a full zip style. Now, these can run both formal and casual, and you can also find them in thinner materials like wool and cotton blends, all the way up to something really thick like cable knit. For something sort of laid back, wear a cardigan over just a plain t-shirt and leave the cardigan unbuttoned to create that sort of laid back vibe. However, if you don't want to have it completely open and unbuttoned, just button like maybe one or two buttons down towards the bottom. But always leave the bottom button undone, no matter what. Now, you can also wear this over, of course, a polo shirt or even a dress shirt with a tie. Now, the thinner the fabric, the more formal it's going to look. But not only that, the thinner the fabric, the better it's going to fit layered underneath, say, a blazer. Now, this is a fantastic look, and it's also a great option for the cold weather months because it's still going to keep you warm without sacrificing any style points. Now, let's talk about knit blazers or sometimes called sweater blazers. This is basically like a nicer version of a cardigan, but it has that look of a blazer. And this is where things get really interesting because a cool way to do it is over, say, a long sleeve polo or even a turtleneck. Once again, it's a smart casual and polished casual look, but it's also relaxed and sophisticated. If you want to dress things up, though, even more, go with a dress shirt and a tie. The cool thing about knit blazers is it feels like you're just wearing a comfortable sweatshirt, but it looks like a nicer jacket. You seriously can't go wrong. Something else to think about is layering for depth. Here's what I mean. So generally speaking, when layering, bring in more texture as you move outwards in layers. Think of it this way. If you're wearing a polo shirt, right, as your base layer, keep the polo shirt simple. So I probably wouldn't wear a heavily textured knit polo underneath the thin marina wool quarter zip sweater. And there's two reasons for this. First, you'll see the texture through this thin fabric of the sweater. So basically the knit polo underneath will leave little impressions on the sweater and it just looks kind of off. Secondly, you want the most texture on your outer layers, right? For example, you wouldn't wear a suede bomber jacket under a t-shirt and you wouldn't wear a cable knit sweater underneath the dress shirt. So go with your thinnest material as your base layer, for example, like a t-shirt, and then get heavier with more texture as you move outwards. You get the deal. But if you're wearing, say, a zip sweater or a cardigan that's more open at the neckline, that's going to give you a lot more visual depth and visual interest because you're able to see all the different layers and all the different textures.

        "transcript": " Welcome gentlemen. So I'm going to assume that you click this video because you're slightly curious, even if it's only a little bit. Maybe you're at a point in your life where you realize that your presentation actually matters. Maybe you're say mid-40s and you're tired of dressing like your teenage kids. Or maybe you're just looking for a few suggestions or some new ideas. Or maybe you're just trying to figure out whether or not I'm worth my salt. Either way, I'm glad you're here. So let's jump in. Now first up, dressing well does not always mean wearing a suit and tie. I haven't worn a suit and tie in almost a year and it's certainly not part of my normal routine. But dressing well means basically being polished and put together. It means less is more. And it also means that those crazy bold patterns and super bright colors don't always mean that that's stylish. Trying to get attention with crazy bold patterns can actually bring you some negative attention. And here's something else just to kind of think about in Chew-On. And I know it's just a movie character, but think about James Bond. He doesn't wear crazy disco shirts with palm trees and crazy patterns all over it. He wears well-fitted, grown-up clothes in solid colors. So let me talk about pants for just a minute. You can still wear jeans and look grown-up and put together. But the trick is getting the right fit and going without all of that crazy distressing. The pants should fit you well right at your natural waist and they shouldn't have a big puddle of fabric down on top of your shoes. For some color options, go with medium blue and dark blue and also medium gray and dark gray. Now you can do other colors like maybe tan and off-white if you want to, but those are more optional. Chinos are going to be another great option because you can wear these in exactly the same way that you would wear a pair of jeans, but you get to dress them up a lot easier. Same thing goes though with the fit. They should sit right at your waist and not puddle and stack up on top of your feet. Now depending on your body type, you can either get something in a slim fit, a straight fit, or an athletic taper. If they do need some adjusting though, do not be afraid to take them to a tailor. With colors, you can do things a little bit different. Maybe go with blue, gray, olive, tan, and even some burgundy. When it comes to footwear, it would be in your best interest to wear some grown-up shoes, right? Stop wearing sandals and foot flops every single day, every single place. Minimal leather sneakers are a great option when you want to be casual, but if you want to step things up a little bit, go with some nice boots, some loafers, or even some type of casual dress shoe like a Derby. And when it comes to boots, you've got a ton of options. So if you like a more rugged look, go for something that has a more rugged or work boot vibe. Maybe something along the lines of something like this. As you can see, it's got a more rugged appearance, but without going all the way down the road of like a full-on work boot. Now all the boots I'm going to be showing today are from Thursday Boots. And if you are new to the Thursday family, let me be the first to tell you that everything they do is amazing in every category. They offer the lowest direct consumer prices on Good Your Well. Boots, leather sneakers, and dress shoes all made with premium USA leather. All of their shoes and boots are designed for guys just like us who understand quality and want quality, but don't want to deal with those crazy overpriced markups. These are comfortable right out of the box. They're sexy as hell. They're well made and they always look amazing. So check this out. I have had these Thursday diplomats for about four or five years now, and I like them so much I just grabbed another pair of them in black. I love these things. And even after all these years, these still look and feel amazing. I also picked up this brand new pair of captains in this beautiful safari suede. These are going to get a lot of miles this season. So if you haven't checked out Thursday Boots lately, I highly, highly encourage you to click the link in the description and just go check these out and go check out everything else that they make. Just go through our special link right down below in the description and go treat yourself and treat your lady friend because they have some beautiful women's boots. Thank you Thursday Boots for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Now something else that I want you to consider and please consider this, and it's wearing dress pants just because. Now I don't mean at the grocery store or getting your car washed, but the next time you're out at an event or a social gathering or maybe it's your next date night, go with a simple nice pair of shoes, maybe gray or navy blue trousers, and maybe either like a nice polo shirt tucked in or a nice dress shirt also tucked in. It is such a simple outfit to put together, but it just seems like nobody wants to put in effort anymore and you can capitalize off of that. I mean look, it takes no more effort wearing something like I just mentioned than it does wearing shorts, a t-shirt and flip flops, but wearing something like I described that's polished and slightly elevated makes you the best dressed guy in the room without even trying. And as a bonus, if you're a single guy, every single lady in that room will put her eyes on you, guaranteed. Now shirt options are going to vary a little bit depending on the season, but polo shirts are an easy grab and they have come a very long way in the last couple years. Find something that's a little more current like a knit polo or even a button sweater polo. You can wear these shirts untucked or tucked in. If you want to be casual, go untucked, that's fine, but as soon as you want to be a little different and more polished, tuck it in. It's wild, but just that one simple move, tucking in your shirt makes this massive difference because it seems like nobody's tucking in their shirt anymore. I mean, think about it. Just a simple act of tucking in your shirt makes you appear more stylish and put together. It's crazy, but it's true. Another style move and technically style piece that I don't think gets talked about enough is the knit blazer. This wears just like a cardigan sweater, but on the surface it looks like a lightweight casual blazer. It's pretty wild because it feels like you're wearing a sweatshirt, but it obviously looks a lot nicer. I mean, I've got a few of these things and you can easily wear them with jeans, chinos, and even dress pants. Jumping back over to shirts for just a minute, a great middle of the road, but also a nice good looking shirt option is a button down shirt. Now, the difference between a button up shirt and a button down shirt is of course the button down collar. Now, this is a button down shirt and this is a button up shirt. The button down collar makes this shirt more casual. Now, technically you can wear a tie with a button down shirt, but ties are generally going to look a little bit better and more appropriate with a standard button up shirt with a stiffer collar. And with all of this said, right, what kind of shoes to wear, what shirt to wear, what pants to wear, all of this is great and anybody can do that and should do that. But the one thing that makes the biggest difference is taking care of your body and being relatively fit. And this demographic, right, my own demographic and the demographic that I make these videos for is the demographic that has most likely let themselves go. And look, man, I'm not trying to shame anyone, but the fact is that clothing looks better on people who are relatively in shape. And when I say relatively, that means that you don't have to be a fitness model. That just means that you take care of yourself and you don't have an extra 20 to 40 pounds that you're constantly trying to get rid of. And then you complain because clothes don't look good on your body. I've said it before and I will say it again. I want the absolute best for every single one of you that tuned in today. I really do. And if just the fact that you want to look better in the clothes that you wear is enough motivation for you to get started on your weight loss journey, your fitness journey, then do it. You don't need to wait for some monumental occasion like New Year's to get started. You can get started right now. Then look, gentlemen, with that, please subscribe for more men's lifestyle content. If you're not subscribed already and as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, welcome to the video. Today we're talking about some clothing options and also color matching for this fall season. And as you're well aware, right, the colors that you're seeing in nature right now are changing and we can mimic those colors in the clothes that we wear. But then the question is, how can we match those fall colors and still look stylish and put together? So first, let's take a look at those colors. Navy blue. Now this is a versatile color that complements just about any other fall color and it works in practically any situation. Next is earthy browns. Now brown is a classic fall color and it can range anywhere from light tan to a deep chocolate. It's a fantastic base color because it pairs really well with other autumn earth tones. Deep dark green. So think about olive green and forest green. Now some other colors might include like burnt orange and warmer reds. So think about burnt orange as a darker, deeper tone of orange instead of something really bright like a summer orange. And when you think about those warmer reds, think about burgundy, maroon, maybe some dark purple and also terracotta, maybe rust and brick. Then we have colors like mustard yellow. So consider this one like a really dark and richer tone of yellow, not like McDonald's yellow. Darker and warmer tones of yellow pair really nicely with other earth tones like brown and green and it can brighten up those otherwise sort of dark and muted fall colors. Then we have neutral tones. So think about gray, beige and khaki because these are going to be great for balancing a lot of bolder colors and they're also really good for being able to create different and versatile outfit combinations. Now let's talk about layering because the weather this time of year can be a bit unpredictable, of course, depending on where you live. But a simple layering structure might look something like this. Starting with say a polo shirt and then a lightweight sweater on top. Then on top of that you can go with maybe a suede bomber jacket or any other type of lightweight jacket like maybe a Harrington or even like an over shirt or a shirt jacket. Now one thing to keep in mind about layering is that every single piece should look good on its own, right? So basically if you take off the jacket the sweater combo should look just fine on its own. You get the idea. But on those days when it's maybe a little bit colder out, swap out the lightweight sweater for something a little heavier like maybe a cable knit sweater. And when it comes to color matching, consider contrasting lighter and darker tones together. For example, you can pair up say a light gray sweater with a dark brown jacket and dark blue pants. The contrast with the darker and lighter tones adds a lot more visual interest and also more dimension. And with jackets you cannot go wrong with a bomber jacket because the style options are endless. You can go for something in a lightweight nylon or something a little bit heavier like suede. And some of my favorite suede bombers are from the jacket maker. I've talked about these guys before and I love what they're doing. You can go with their standard sizing or you can go with their made to measure program that'll be tailored to your exact measurements. They use only premium materials like full grain leather and they use YKK zippers and the construction is top tier. Just by looking at these jackets you can tell they have tons of different style options and they also offer full customization. Their high customer satisfaction rating absolutely speaks for itself. And I've even heard personally from many of you who have ordered your own jacket telling me how much you absolutely love it. And right now they're offering this audience 10% off if you go through the link down in the description and use code 40 over. If you want an amazing killer new jacket or if you want to gift it to someone else you've got to go take advantage of this deal right now. Thank you jacket maker for sponsoring this video. And when it comes to pants go for well-fitted options in earth tones like again gray olive navy blue and brown because all of these colors are great for the fall season and they're going to pair up easily with everything else that we're talking about in this video today. So think about going with dark jeans maybe a white long sleeve shirt a navy jacket and brown boots for example. But if you like chinos better you can absolutely wear chinos in the same exact way you would wear jeans. Let's talk about sweaters for just a minute because the right sweater will instantly elevate your style. So you can go with a crew neck a v-neck or even cardigans in those fall appropriate colors that we mentioned earlier. So consider this though a navy blue v-neck sweater goes perfectly with tan pants and a forest green cardigan also looks great with a white shirt and jeans. And also don't shy away from experimenting or playing around with textures like cashmere or cable knit because not only do these add some extra dimension but they're also going to keep you nice and warm. Let's talk about color coordination because when done well it will completely elevate your style game. Complimentary colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel make perfect combinations and it's just hard to get wrong. So in the fall going with like any shade of brown and navy blue or say dark olive green with burgundy those are all visual appealing and they always work. You can also think about going monochrome which is pairing up different shades of the same color family all together. So think about wearing light blue, medium blue and dark blue all in one outfit. And also don't be too afraid of patterns this time of year like plaid or pinstripes. You can easily incorporate any of those patterns in your shirts or jackets. Now another cool option is to use analogous colors. So these colors will sit next to each other on the color wheel and have similar undertones which is kind of similar to monochrome combos. But you can also go with neutral foundations using neutral colors as a base but then add in like some subtle pops of those fall colors. For example you can run with like a monochrome gray outfit but then add something like a burnt orange scarf or maybe a burgundy sweater or jacket. It's also okay to mix in a few subtle modern trends right. So think about maybe some updated fabric textures and maybe a few updated cuts that can allow you to still look relevant but without sacrificing the classic overall aesthetic. Now this is also a really good time of year to sort of go through your wardrobe and remove pieces that no longer fit or that you simply haven't worn in the last couple years. Because chances are if you're anything like me if you didn't wear it last fall you're probably not going to wear it this fall. And I'm curious so I would love to hear what some of your favorite fall combinations are so please let me know down below in the comments and as always my friends thank you so much for watching live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Here's something I find kind of interesting. So right around the age of 40, give or take, we find opportunities and seek out opportunities to kind of redefine who we are and how we present ourselves to the world that helps us feel, I guess, more accomplished and more self-confident. But look, it's not about impressing women or anybody else. It's more about feeling high value in a way that showcases your self-worth. And for the record, it's totally okay to project yourself as high status because if you have made it this far and you've had some success, you most likely also have self-awareness. You probably live a relatively healthy lifestyle. You have good personal style, emotional intelligence, some financial stability, and also some goals that you're still working towards. And today I wanna chat about a few different things you can do and a few different things that you can wear that allow you to be perceived as higher status or higher value. But first, please understand that high value starts from right here. Self-awareness is where everything starts. And self-awareness means understanding who you are, your motivations, right? Your strengths and weaknesses. And it also means that you understand what your triggers are and it means that you understand what your boundaries are and you also understand what you're willing to tolerate from other people. And with all of that said, self-awareness is basically understanding yourself completely which in turn gives you more self-confidence because when you know who you are and what you stand for, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone. And it's that clarity that naturally projects outward and positions you as a high value individual. Health and fitness gentlemen, here's the thing. Most men over 40, for whatever reason, let themselves go. But if you exercise and eat well and have a decently fit physique, that places you in the top percentage points of men in this age bracket. But it's not about looking like a 20 year old and having that type of physique that you had 25 years ago. It's more about maintaining a level of physical health that gives you a decent physique, helps your energy levels and your longevity. And you knew this next one was coming but wearing better clothes also makes a massive difference. But again, it's not so much about dressing for other people but it's dressing in a way that shows your self-worth and your self-confidence. So instead of going for like a loose fitting baggy pair of jeans that looks sort of sloppy, go for a pair of well-fitted dark wash denim and then maybe a pair of like neutral tone, high quality trousers that are just stylish enough to be worn at nicer social occasions. Wear an actual watch, not a computer watch, but sure, I get it, I understand that you can check your email on your watch and that's great and everything. But if you're taking your lady friend out for a date on a Saturday night, wear an actual watch because a watch adds this element of refinement to everything else that you're wearing. Also think about choosing a watch that suits your individual personality and your lifestyle. So maybe that's a dress watch, maybe a dive watch or a chronograph. The brand and the model are a lot less important than how the watch complements your style and how you feel wearing it. It also signifies this sense of maturity, masculinity, punctuality and also an appreciation for craftsmanship. And that's where our watches come in, in particular, their chronographs. The Chronograph 001 collection pays homage to the heritages of chronograph watches which originated in the early 19th century as a specialized tool for precise timekeeping in various fields like aviation, racing and sports. Now combining traditional chronograph design with modern sophistication, these watches offer practical functionality, including stopwatch capability alongside their very stylish design. Everything they have is gorgeous, but I think these two might just sort of take the cake for me. They're both black dials and I'm a sucker for two-tone, but this one, this classic chrono with stainless and a black dial, perfection in my opinion. Keep in mind, these are all made with Japanese Seiko course movements. They use a sapphire crystal and they use surgical grade stainless steel. Now there's gonna be a link down below in the description that's gonna get you 30% off their chrono watches and of course everything else that they have if you use code fashion at checkout. Now, if you're in the market for a new watch, you have gotta go check these out. The link is right down below. Moving on to quality shirts. Well-fitted, dark neutral tone shirts look best on most guys, but of course white is always gonna be a nice staple, but if you're carrying a few extra pounds around the middle, I would advise against white and maybe go for darker solid colors. Good quality, cashmere wool sweaters also add sophistication and class to everything you're wearing. Same thing goes with polo shirts if you want like a more refined casual look. Everything should fit comfortably and not be too tight or too loose. And depending on what your personal style is, you have a lot of options when it comes to footwear. Leather loafers can be worn in both business casual and more relaxed settings. Oxford's and Derby dress shoes are more formal for those occasions and they complement suits perfectly. But maybe you're a boot guy or maybe you're a sneaker guy. Chelsea boots are versatile and stylish. You can pair those up with say dark wash denim and a blazer and you can also wear them with trousers for a more sophisticated look. Now with sneakers, I would go for something in a minimal design aesthetic with of course good quality leather. White sneakers go with practically anything, but I would reserve those for the casual situations. Now you can pair up the same dark denim jeans with a nice pair of leather sneakers in brown, blue and even black. And also spending just a small amount of time on your grooming routine is just a very simple straightforward but also an incredibly powerful way to project self-respect. Here's the deal. Nobody cares if you have hair or don't have hair or have a beard or don't have a beard. Nobody cares. What people do care about and what makes you look like you give a shit about yourself is how you take care of what you have. Trim down the hair on the back of your neck. Have a skincare routine. Take care of your nose hairs and make sure that your eyebrows aren't going crazy and growing into your eyeballs. If you have a beard, just keep it neat. And if you're currently don't wear a fragrance, I would suggest that you start. Personally, I would look for one signature scent that can work in a lot of different situations. And I know there's a lot of different opinions about this, but here's a few that I would recommend. First, Mont Blanc Legend Spirit. This is basically go anywhere, do anything. It's relatively affordable and it gets a lot of compliments. Now the next one is of course, good old creative ventures. This thing just works no matter what. However, it's ridiculously expensive. So if you want something that smells basically the same, go check out Rebel from Pete and Pedro or go to Alt Fragrances and get their dupe version of this Aventus for a heck of a lot cheaper. Something else that gives you a definite feeling of high value is having control over your finances. And this is something I'm working on right now. Financial independence isn't just about your overall wealth. It's more about, I guess, the freedom to make decisions without feeling restricted by something. This also means being in control of your savings, paying down your debt, investing for the future, and having a plan for retirement. And let's not forget about the all important emotional intelligence. This is a key characteristic of high value men because it affects both your personal relationships and your professional relationships. It means that you don't lose control. It means that you know how to manage your emotions. It means that you have the ability to stay composed during difficult situations because having a calm response to challenges is a key indicator of maturity and wisdom. I want you to also realize and keep in mind that the people that you surround yourself with will significantly impact your sense of self-worth and also your reputation. Your social circle should consist of people who inspire you, share your values, and bring positivity to your life, not useless BS drama. It's more about quality, not quantity. Focus on those people that are positive and contribute to your overall happiness and well-being. It's about creating a life and in turn projecting a life that feels rewarding and authentic where the choices you make contribute to your happiness and your self-respect. And listen, if you made it this far, please hit that like button to let me know. And also please consider subscribing if you're not already. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Okay, gentlemen, let's have a little chat about testosterone. So my last video about TRT was my three month update, and that was almost a year ago at this point. And since then, a lot of you have asked for a new update. So I wanted to sit down with you guys today and show you some of my current blood work and talk about how I'm doing and how I'm feeling after a little over a year being on testosterone replacement therapy. Now, first and foremost, I'm not a doctor. So let's make that clear. But there are a lot of very interesting conversations about TRT for men that I just don't quite understand. And we'll get into some of that here. But I do hear from a lot of you guys that tell me that you went and had your blood work done and you were right around the 300 range with your total testosterone, but your doctor wouldn't prescribe it because you were technically within range. So the range that I have for me, somebody my age, which is mid 50s, is somewhere between 280 to 1100. So yeah, technically 300 would be within range. But come on, man, it's not by much. And it's common knowledge that men feel better and have more energy if there's somewhere closer to the middle of that range, like 700 to 800, for example. So unless I'm missing something, why won't most doctors prescribe testosterone replacement for these guys? I even had this one guy send me a message saying that his doctor wanted to put him on antidepressants instead of testosterone when his levels were, I think they were around 320, which was right at the very bottom of that range. And if I remember also, he even told his doctor he didn't want to take antidepressants and he would be more interested in trying TRT. But his doctor said no. So again, unless I'm missing something, I just don't get it. Now here's something else. I don't know why there seems to be this stigma attached to men having hormone replacement when they get older, when it seems to be open conversation and completely acceptable for women to have hormone replacement when they get older. Honestly, I have never fully understood the double standard because we both benefit from it. First, there's always going to be people that are just completely against taking any type of medication or supplement that isn't natural. And that's fine. But there's no such thing as natural hormone replacement. It's all bio identical hormone. Your body produces what it produces, right? And you can only boost testosterone so much with diet, exercise and over the counter supplements. And again, though, we're only talking about a few small points here. So it's not even going to be enough to move the needle, especially if you're say late 40s, 50s or 60s. And I'm going to show you my results, but I guess I just want to go on record right now and say that if you're against taking TRT because it's against your belief system, that's totally fine. But for the rest of us that are interested in feeling and performing our best, I just kind of think it's something that we should consider because at least for me, it's been a game changer. All right. So here are some of the highlights of my most recent blood work from just about two weeks ago and spoiler alert, it's pretty darn solid. So I'll just hit some of the parts that were just a little bit out of range. All right. First is my hemoglobin and my hemotocrit. I think that's how you pronounce it. The good range for hemoglobin, the range is between 13.2 and 18.0. I was at 18.6. My hemotocrit range is between 43.0 and 60.0. I was at 60.0, just a little bit high in both. The solution for this is to basically just go donate blood every couple of months. Now I don't know all the science behind that, but I guess the way I like to look at it is essentially having my oil changed every few months. But also, look, donating blood is also a nice thing to go do. But something else we found that was quite high was my DHEA. So that range is supposed to be from 34.5 up to 568.9. Now my level was high, 1480.1. And that one's pretty interesting because when I went in for my last blood panel about six months ago, I was practically at zero. So he wanted to get me on daily DHEA supplements. So since my last blood panel, I went on that supplement and I was taking about 100 milligrams every day. And really, that was just a bit too much. So now I'm cutting that dose in half to basically see where I end up in another six months. Another reason, though, that I think that number might be high is because the morning of my blood work two weeks ago, I took that supplement that morning. So I don't know if that affected the results, but either way, I'm going to reduce that dosage by half. Now a couple other factors in some other areas. My coronary risk is very good. My vitamin D level is very good as well. And my PSA markers are very low. The PSA scale goes from zero to 4.0. I was at 0.740. My estradiol level was very good, so I don't need to be on any type of estrogen blocker. Now the numbers that you probably all came for that you're waiting for are my total testosterone and my free testosterone. My total testosterone scale, like I mentioned earlier, is between 280 to 1100. I'm at 815. It's basically the same number I was at six months ago. Now also keep in mind that I inject testosterone every Thursday, and this blood test was done on the Wednesday before my injection. So basically this was, I guess, at the end of my cycle on day six. I don't know how it would have looked if it was on like day three or day four, but either way that just kind of gives you an idea of where my levels are right now. Okay, so let's look at free testosterone. That scale is from 3.9 to 22.5, and my number was 25.5, just a little high, but otherwise pretty good. And here's something else that I see a lot in the comments whenever I talk about testosterone at all. Some people will say things like, once you start on TRT, you have to be on it for the rest of your life, or you can never get off of it because your levels will drop off again. Here's the thing I want you all to realize. You get on testosterone because your balls don't produce enough of it anyway. So if you're sitting there at 250 total tests right now, and that's your baseline, that is a very low number and it's basically non-existent. So if you take testosterone to get your numbers back up, you can absolutely get off of it anytime you want. You'll just return back to your baseline, which is again basically non-existent because your body doesn't produce it anyway. Think of it in the same way as maintaining a healthy diet to stay fit. If you stop eating a healthy diet and go back to your old ways of eating cheeseburgers and pizza every day, you'll gain weight again. So in my mind, there's virtually no difference, so I just don't understand that argument. Now let's talk about my personal experience. I inject myself in my glutes every single week. And yes, it sucks every single time, but you just do it anyway, right? It's like one and a half seconds of ouch and then it's totally fine. Anybody can do this. But yeah, it still sucks every time. But also consider it doesn't suck any less having somebody else do it for you every week. You can totally do this yourself. One of the things that I realized here is that it's not like taking heroin or cocaine or something, right? You don't just take it and then all of a sudden feel like you can walk through a brick wall and you don't change from Clark Kent to Superman overnight. It doesn't work that way. It's basically a nice, easy, slow burn over time once it sort of gets in your system and starts to regulate. Your sleep gets better. Your energy level goes up. Your focus increases. If you're in the gym, you will see muscle growth that you haven't probably seen since you were in your 20s and 30s. But not only that, it's just having the energy to get off the couch and go to the gym or go for that walk or go do anything. That is the part that will change your life because now you feel like actually going to do something rather than just sitting on the couch all day. Now here's something else that I want to make very clear. This is not steroids, right? I'm not losing my hair. My balls aren't shriveling up into superior. I don't have acne all over my back. My man boobs aren't getting any bigger. I don't have an increased risk of cancer and my prostate still looks very good like I just showed you. So a lot of the things that many guys seem to be scared of are basically non-existent for me and also most men. And I think that's the one thing that I hope you'll take away from my experience. I'm not pushing this down your throat and I'm not trying to sell you on TRT. I'm just sharing my experience. But with that said, I'm also advocating for you to be as healthy and as energetic as possible. So if this is something that you're interested in and you've been running into roadblocks with your doctor, chances are there's a hormone clinic in your area or at least close by you that you can contact and go get your blood panel done and just find some options that might work for you. And just one more thing, please consider subscribing for more men's lifestyle content. And thank you very much for watching. Live well and I will see you all in the next one."

        "transcript": " If you watch my channel on a somewhat regular basis, you know that I am pretty much my own demographic. So basically, I'm just like you. And when I make videos specifically like this one, it's because if I'm going through something or dealing with something, chances are a lot of you might be going through something very similar. Life is always full of these moments of opportunities and uncertainty and decisions that can completely change your future. And taking chances, specifically the ones that have to do with personal growth or change in your trajectory, can be pretty scary. Now, just talking about men here, but of course women go through some of the very same things. But society's expectations and our own built-in limitations and boundaries can increase the fear of taking risks and taking chances. And this is absolutely normal, but men generally face more pressure because taking risks is something that we're supposed to do. I mean, think about it. Even back when we were kids, we took our bikes down the biggest hill we could find. We built the biggest sidewalk jumps we could possibly make. We snuck out of the house at night even though we knew we were going to get busted. And maybe we even stole our dad's brand new sports car in the middle of the night and then got pulled over by the cops because we didn't turn the headlights on. Well, maybe that one was just me. Let me talk a little bit about some of the fears that we're faced with when we think about taking chances or trying something new. And the first one is that big fear of rejection, specifically when it comes to fitting in with people or finding relationships. The fear of rejection prevents way too many guys from approaching women, making new friends, or even trying to fit into social circles where a guy might feel out of place. And in terms of relationships, I don't really talk about or even share that much of my personal life in these videos or even on Instagram. I mean, I have in the past a little bit on these videos, but I tend for the most part to keep that part of my life pretty private. With that said, though, I think I might owe it to you guys just to let you know that a little more than a month ago, I ended a relationship with a woman that I had been seeing for quite a while. So I'm dealing with that right now. So when we talk about the fear of rejection when approaching women, because that's a big one for a lot of guys, I would encourage you to keep practicing. Just remember, you didn't know her a minute ago. So if you go up and say hi to someone, and it turns out that she has a boyfriend already, it's all good because again, you didn't know her a minute ago. You're right back where you started, no harm, no foul, but at least you got up and did the thing. Now, do I have a fear of rejection? Yes and no, but mostly no. Now, sure, I might get a little nervous approaching women, but here's the thing. I know that my approach is coming from a very good place and I know that my approach isn't coming off creepy or threatening. I've done it enough times to understand where and when is a good opportunity and when and where isn't. I know how to use my body language and I generally know some things to say that will start a nice friendly conversation. So again, I would encourage each and every one of you to continue working that muscle. I've got a lot more ground to cover in this video, but if your fears are keeping you from achieving the things that you know deep down you should be achieving, or if they're keeping you from doing the things that you know you should be doing, it's time to talk to someone and figure that out.

Thank you BetterHelp for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Now let's chat about the fear of failure because this is one of the biggest fears men face when taking chances. Here's part of the reason why. Society teaches men that success is one of the defining traits of masculinity and failure can be seen as inadequacy and it's also a huge hit to our self-worth because if I didn't do the thing that I set out to do, something must be wrong with me. The pressure to succeed is basically paralyzing and it keeps men from starting new businesses, switching careers or pursuing any type of new opportunity. For example, a lot of you know that I'm starting a new wine business and if it fails, it's going to fail publicly. I might feel like I let myself down, but I'm also going to feel like I let all of you down. And that brings up the fear of judgment because again, if I fail, everybody can take their shot at me and judge me or say whatever they want to say. And that fear of judgment is another reason that men don't push for something better or try something new, even if it's pursuing that one true passion or that one thing that you've always thought about doing. Now this one is really interesting and it's the fear of success and it might seem counterintuitive, but the fear of success is a real fear that men face because success could bring new challenges and new pressures and achieving success might also lead to responsibilities and demands that you might not be prepared to handle. I mean, think about being just thrown into some leadership position that you're just not qualified for. You will have to deal with problems and responsibilities that you can't even imagine at this point. Fear of success can also lead to a fear of change because success can also bring out changes in your lifestyle, your identity and even your relationships. The one fear that I tend to gravitate towards the most is the fear of regret. So as far as the business I'm starting right now, I know I have to do it and I know that if I didn't do it, I would regret it for the rest of my life. I mean, look, you guys, I am 55 years old and I've got maybe 20 good solid years in front of me and I don't want that lifetime of regret waiting for me at the end. I feel like the stakes are high and now is my opportunity. I would rather try it and fail publicly than not try it at all. But a lot of men fear that if they make the wrong choice, they'll look back with regret. You might look back and wonder what might have been if you took a different path, but if that's your mentality, you'll never do anything. The future hasn't even happened yet. So what's the point wasting time thinking about decisions you're making right now because your decision hasn't happened yet, hasn't gone anywhere yet? It's good to understand that you have some fears, right? Even if it's only just one of these fears, it's still good to recognize what you're dealing with. So maybe yours is the fear of failure. Good. You know what the roadblock is. So lay the groundwork now and do the work now to be able to move past it so that you can go get what's yours and go get what's waiting for you. I know more motivational talk from John today, gentlemen, but look, the truth is I love you guys and I want the best for you. I really do. Now, please let me know your thoughts on this down below. And if you made it this far, you are definitely one of the true legends. So hit that like button to let me know. So always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " This is gonna be a fun one because today's video topic idea came from one of you and in fact it actually came from one of my very few Female subscribers, so she hit me up on Instagram and wrote me this I saw a segment on a show this week that thought might be an idea for your channel Taking a summer outfit and changing a couple things to make it for fall shoes sweater and jacket It was for women so there was more accessories to change in the outfit Thought maybe you could work for men's outfits. I know you already did a big outfit one recently But maybe something you can do later Thank you very much for this idea and that's exactly what this video is gonna be about today and just for the record you guys I Do get a lot of I guess unsolicited video topic ideas Some are good, but most of them just really wouldn't work in a full-length video However with that said if there's a topic that you want me to cover Please feel free to leave a comment on this video or just slide into my DMs on Instagram now on the surface this whole idea Seem pretty simple But really once I started getting into it and choosing different outfits It was actually a little more difficult than I initially thought because at least for me I wear shorts like all the time in the summer because it's really hot where I live and Shorts don't really work for fall outfits So what I had to do was go through some of the things that I was wearing over the last few months when I was out during the late Afternoons and evenings so it's pretty common for me Especially over the weekend to go out somewhere for dinner and then hit up like a wine bar or a cocktail lounge after dinner So most of what I'm gonna be showing you today works in those scenarios But I also want to throw in a very casual example at the end. Okay for this first example I'm wearing these off-white pants with these cool side adjusters and suede loafers And I'm also wearing this brown knit button polo the pants are this linen cotton blend and they're a little bit roomy on me because they just don't stretch like something in say like a Cotton spandex blend and this is absolutely something that I've worn out this past summer So to make it more like fall I put on some socks and I went with these suede chukka boots and this olive green shirt jacket I think the colors blend really well together and this is definitely something I would wear out this fall Here's something that's pretty interesting because she was right in her message to me that women have a lot more accessories to play around With and we do so we can't be quite as subtle But adding the boots and the lightweight shirt jacket really helps bring in some of that fall vibe Something else I wanted to mention here really quick is the socks I get a lot of pushback in the comments when it looks like I'm not wearing Socks in some of my lookbook videos, but I promise you 99% of the time I am wearing socks I just wear the no-show socks But this time of year when the temperature starts dropping my number one sock of choice are these from straight up socks I have talked about these guys a lot before in other videos And that's because these are basically all I wear this time of year and I've even shown you that my entire Sock drawer is full of these I've got a bunch in solid colors And I've got a bunch in our guile and now they have expanded their lineup with some all-new Amazing athletic socks for those of you who are active these new athletic socks are built to keep up with your every move ergonomically contoured for precise fit These socks are differentiated by left and right foot designs to better match the natural shape of your toes Zoned cushioning on the bottom of these socks offers extreme cushioning for cloud-like comfort Mesh vents and advanced hydrophilic fibers work together to wick away moisture keeping your feet cool and dry During your workouts they use proprietary silicone strips on the inside to keep your sock in place and looking good all day long because I for one Really hate having to always reach down and pull up my socks throughout the day These solve that problem while still being comfortable the small profile of those little silicone strips Hold the sock in place instead of having to rely on this elastic being super tight because that gets very uncomfortable These are made with moisture wicking pima cotton because it resists pilling feels amazing and always looks nice and smooth They also have a reciprocated heel for a better fit smooth toe seams and a reinforced heel and toe for much longer wear There's gonna be a special discount code and link down in the description that gets you 15% off until the end of October when you use the code fall fashion 24 once again This offer runs until the end of October using the code fall fashion 24 so if you need to restock your sock drawer with some quality socks this fall these are Definitely what you need so hit that link below and grab yourself a few pairs today before time runs out Okay, the next combination starts with these dark brown loafers light blue chinos and this brown knit polo Totally something I've worn this past summer and it's a pretty versatile look in my opinion because as you know Blue and brown Complement each other so then I changed up two things to bring in the fall vibe First the burgundy quarter zip sweater and then those dark brown leather Chelsea boots I think that the light pants still work really well in this combination And this could be a very nice polished casual date night outfit now I like the light blue chinos so much that I wanted to do one more fall outfit with this one So I swapped out the Chelsea boots for these more rugged looking boots And then I went with this long sleeve lightweight sweater now This is kind of a mix between a long sleeve t-shirt and a sweater So it actually works really well tucked in now I specifically did not wear a jacket with this one because I wanted you to imagine a jacket that you might already have in your closet And what that would look like paired up with this so my mind immediately goes to Brown suede or blue suede, but just try to imagine wearing this basic combo with a jacket that you already have Let me know in the comments what you'd pair up with it Okay, now we've got another evening or dinner look I went with a pair of brown loafers grey pattern dress trousers and this navy blue knit polo I think it's a pretty versatile look at least in my opinion that could work in a lot of situations Now for the fall example all I did was add some gray socks and this blue cardigan sweater Super simple but also a classy and sophisticated polished casual appearance And like I said earlier it's pretty normal for me to be out to dinner somewhere on like a Friday or Saturday night And then head somewhere afterwards for some live music and maybe a few cocktails and this is something I would absolutely wear Okay for the next casual look I'm going with white leather sneakers But of course brown gray or blue sneakers would also work just fine Gray denim and this navy blue short sleeve Henley Pretty clean and simple right but still a very casual summertime outfit So to turn it into a fall outfit all I did was add this plaid shirt jacket And it actually has a flannel inner lining so it does add some pretty good insulation And I think the design and the pattern are both super cool and it's really just a great piece to just grab and go And gentlemen I'm very curious what you think about this whole concept and maybe we do some more of this stuff So please let me know your thoughts down below in the comments and consider subscribing if you're not already And as always my friends thank you so much for watching live well and I will see you in the next one"

        "transcript": " I hope you'll listen up for a minute because what I'm about to say sort of hit home for me and it might hit home for you as well. One of the main reasons, and there are several reasons for this, but one of the main reasons that older people need to move into assisted living centers is because they can't get themselves on and off the toilet. They basically lost so much muscle in their legs and their flexibility is basically non-existent. Can you imagine what that would do to your pride as a man being otherwise fairly healthy but needing assistance going to the bathroom? And let me say right off the top here that I do work out, but I also know where my lane is. I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist, and I'm not a fitness expert or any type of nutritionist. What I am though is concern for your well-being and of course my own. Aging is inevitable, right? It's a part of life, but how we age depends on our lifestyle choices. And right around the age of 40, changes to our bodies start accelerating. This includes sarcopenia, which is muscle loss, decreased bone density, slower metabolism, and hormone imbalances. However, regular exercise, specifically strength training and muscle building exercises, have incredible long-term benefits. And it's not just about appearance, it's about maintaining your health and your quality of life long-term. And one of the most significant age-related changes is that gradual loss of muscle mass known as scarpenia. Research shows that beginning at around age 30, we lose about 3-5% of our muscle mass per decade, and it accelerates past 40. For both men and women, the loss in muscle decreases your mobility and it puts you at a higher risk of falling down and getting injured, not to mention your ability to get yourself on and off the toilet. Now let me talk for just a second about longevity and the quality of life, because it's not just about living longer, it's about living better. And study after study after study has consistently shown that people who engage in regular physical activities, specifically strength training, live longer and healthier lives. Exercise and strength training have been shown to prevent or even manage conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. It also improves your ability to live independently on your own and it reduces your need to have to move into assisted living or a nursing home. Studies have also shown that older people who exercise have better mobility, fewer disabilities, and of course a more active life. And here is the kicker for me. Regular physical activity lowers your risk of several types of cancer including breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Exercise also boosts your immune system, helping your body to fight off illness and recover a lot faster if you do get sick. And if you are exercising and weight training, it's important that you get enough protein intake. So depending on what your goals are, the general rule is one gram of protein per pound of body weight. So for me, right now I'm sitting at 175 and I'm trying to build muscle. So technically, I should be consuming 175 grams of protein per day. Now, that's not as easy as it sounds and I don't always hit that number, but I'm generally somewhere over 100 grams per day depending on the day and what I eat. And I have become quite the expert on cooking steak on cast iron and I'm not even kidding you guys, I make an amazing New York strip. So what I generally do is I'll make two steaks at a time, right? I'll have one for dinner and then chop up the other one into small little chunks and then have it with scrambled eggs for the next like two to three mornings. And just that breakfast by itself is about 40 grams of protein. Here's the thing though, my life has become incredibly busy recently and the demands on my time are beyond crazy. Fourth quarter is always really busy with YouTube and then starting my wine business at the same time right now has me working a whole lot of hours. So one way that I'm managing my diet and my protein intake and everything else is with factor meals. Factor makes meeting your nutrition goals easier than ever by delivering fresh, never frozen, dietitian approved meals right to your doorstep. They have a team of gourmet chefs that create each meal using only ingredients with integrity so you feel your best all day long. Their meals are ready in just two minutes and you can choose from a weekly menu of 35 options including popular options like Calorie Smart, Keto, Protein Plus or Vegan and Veggie. So I chose Protein Plus to make sure I'm getting all my protein in. Factor also offers snack options including breakfast, smoothies, juices, small bites and a lot more so it's easy to fit everything into your schedule. And I'm telling you what, these protein shakes with 18 grams of protein and also caffeine are absolutely fantastic. Factor is also really flexible because you can change up your order every week with plans from four to 18 meals per week. You can also pause or reschedule your deliveries anytime. So if you want to get started, head over to factor75.com or click that link down below and use code FASTION50 and you will get 50% off your first factor box and then you'll get 20% off your next month of orders. That's code FASTION50 at factor75.com to get 50% off your first box plus 20% off your next month of orders. That's basically 20% off your next four boxes. So if you want to go check this out, this is definitely something you want to jump on right now. I want to talk about hormone balance for just a minute and then I want to get into how exercise can improve your mental health because that is a big one. We all know that hormone changes are an issue for both men and women as we get older. For women, the most notable change is the reduction of estrogen associated with menopause and men have a decline in testosterone known as andropause. Strength training in men has been shown to naturally boost testosterone and there's no secret that testosterone plays a key role in maintaining our muscle mass, our bone density and helping our energy levels. And a lot of men, me included, choose to do testosterone replacement therapy to get our levels back to normal while still going to the gym. And from personal experience, I'm telling you reduced testosterone is a bish because it takes away all of your energy and motivation. Men with low testosterone know they need to go to the gym to lose weight and get healthy, but they just don't have the energy or motivation. So getting your blood work done to see what your panel is right now and then starting on testosterone if you're a good candidate can bring back your motivation and your energy to start exercising. It is a complete game changer for thousands of men. Now let me chat about mental health and cognitive function for just a few minutes because the benefits of exercise is more than just your body image and looking good with your shirt off. Physical exercise increases the production of chemicals in your brain like endorphins, serotonin and dopamine that boost your mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. And studies have shown over and over again that strength training has significantly reduced symptoms of depression in older people. Also, regular exercise including strength training has been linked with improved cognitive function and a lower risk of cognitive decline. Exercise increases all that blood flow to your brain which helps maintain all your brain activities like memory, attention and problem solving. It's also been linked to the lower risk of diseases like Alzheimer's. Exercise also helps reduce stress by lowering cortisol levels and the side benefit is improved mood and improved sleep. And I haven't even touched on the weight management benefit but muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue meaning that it burns more calories at rest. And this helps counteract those weight gains that come with age-related metabolic slowdown. I know I'm talking about a lot of research in this video and look, I totally get it. If it was easy, everybody would be fit but unfortunately it's not easy. It's hard and it requires dedication. I have several friends of mine, personal friends that talk to me about their frustrations in dating and clothes not fitting their bodies very well and knowing that they need to lose like 25 pounds. And these are mostly guys in their 40s and 50s. These are friends of mine and if they see this, they already know. A lot of their problems can be answered and corrected in the gym and in the kitchen. I'm making this video today for you and for them because I want the best for you. I really do. I want you to live a long life with the best quality of life you can possibly have. You are the only one standing in your way of getting your health and your fitness back in check. And if you made it this far in today's video, you are definitely one of the true legends.

        "transcript": " What's going on everyone? So welcome to beautiful Beulton, California. We just spent five hours in this thing, me and Vito. Vito La Fada from La Fada Sellers out of Temecula. He's bringing some fruit up here to get produced by these guys and we're going to go in and check these guys out in just a few minutes. We're unloading the truck right now and I'm going to try to get some b-roll of that and go inside and take a little tour. My first time here and they're working so I don't know that I want to bother too many people. The main partner owner isn't here but I think we're going to chat with Vito and also the winemaker so we'll kind of see how today plays out but I'm glad to get out of that truck and I'm excited to be here. These are your grapes that we just had delivered. Yep, this is our Merlot. Merlot and we're de-stemming. This is the de-stemming machine. Everything goes up into this big machine. It starts to kind of filter out the big chunks of the stuff that are in there and it shoots on up this little ladder if you will and that puts it into the de-stemmer over there that's going to spit them out on the back side, pulls out the best juice into the bin there and then the stemmer and all the debris that we don't want gets spit out on the back side. Every time we harvest this process goes on as one of the first stages of what we got to do to get the wine prepared for fermentation. So after it goes up here, does it just like shake the shit out of it? No, it puts it through almost like a filter and it'll just strip it out so that those fall out and you've got the remaining crap stem that you don't want down here anymore. Stuff that goes bye-bye. We don't like this. We like what's in that barrel. Let's walk around and look at that one. The what? The unsexy but needed part? That's it. All right, let's take a look at this. That's right. In there you get the beautiful grape. There we go. Look at that. That's going to make some good wine. We're doing this with the grapes that you're using for your wine. I love it. So we're coming. We're all part of the process. Sounds good. What did you bring over? Like we brought sara and kapsav over but then we also work with a grower to grab some merlot. Merlot, that's right. We grab merlot from uh same guy that kind of tends our vines. Okay. And then we brought in our sara that are now in their 60 year and we brought over our kapsav that's in its third year. Fantastic. Yeah. Look at this you guys. Check this out. How many pounds? 15,000 pounds. All of it was probably about 20,000 pounds. 20,000 pounds we just brought up here. That's why the truck was so freaking slow. That's why we couldn't go faster than 55. I know we're trying to go up these. We're trying to go up these hills to get here. And like the truck would just not go fast at all. So we were doing like 32 miles an hour in like a 60 up this hill. But yeah so far so good. There's still a lot more to go as you can see. Not a lot of reasons so good. Yeah these will you know you've got juicy berries here but this stuff we'll wait for those to kind of get incorporated. Let that sugar release. Get a good consistent sugar reading before we inoculate. Maybe water back a little bit just so our alcohol is in check. And then put it right down the rock. Alrighty we are tasting. I need to make some choices. What wines do I want to launch with? There's several options. There's also some time constraints based on when I want to launch and what I can realistically launch with. Like what's ready to go kind of stuff. Roll out what's ready now and the rest you hold back a little bit until it's ready to go. Exactly. So this is Sauvignon Blanc? This is Sauvignon Blanc. Now remember when you got these they just got put in bottle maybe a month or a month and a half ago. This wine here? That's right. So the nose on it's solid it's going to probably need a little time to get the finish on it. Sure. Sure. By the time you release to the public it'll be there. Alright. This gives you a good idea of where it's at. So far I like I like the nose fruity lemon lime, lemon grass typical Sauvignon. Yep. It hasn't been in the fridge so we got a little bit of but it's already you can already tell it's got solid base solid foundation so it's going to be a good wine. That's actually that's right where I like it. Yep. There's that tiny tiny bit of tartness to it which are probably mellow out over time. And when we're talking about what you want to release Sauvignon, we're definitely going to recommend at least a white uh we were just discussed about getting ros\u00e9 in bottle so that does that. Yeah. Shards another great one but at least one white and a couple reds if we can but yeah I prefer seeing you maybe do two whites two reds at least. Yeah. It just depends on over time what we roll out. Yep for sure. So legit this is the first time I've got my nose and my palate on this and what do we want? Do we have a red at least one or two reds we're going to? Yes we will be able to be able to taste the cassove and I think we have the chardonnay that we can taste. Okay. So we'll see where they're at. Fantastic gentlemen. Dean's the man that tells us. All right. Dean's the winemaker so he's busy right now. The winemaker doesn't really want to chat on camera totally fine but off camera he talked a lot about how recently these wines were bottled and you explained it in a more physical dynamic way. Yeah. He grabbed the hold of me and shook the shit out of me. So if I'm grabbing John and shaking the crap out of him and that you have to imagine that somebody did that to you body like physically violently just shook the crap out of you. It takes you a couple seconds to get your bearings back right? Right. Well when wine is being pumped into the bottle it's a it's a violent process it's getting jammed in there so everything is a little bit disturbed if you will. Kind of like John. Whatever. And it just takes a little time to settle back down. Yeah. It's going to allow us the flavor profiles to settle back to the right order. And that's I think my biggest takeaway is like all the flavors are out of order right now. There should be the top there should be a base or a middle and then that base flavor. You always have wines well good wines will have a tertiary like the primary that you take in secondary flavor and tertiary. If you get wines down to a tertiary level first off you're a good wine drinker and three two you got great wine in front of you and that's it right now these bottles need a little bit more time these wines need a little bit more time to get the order settled back down. So that's why you were tasting the tartness before you were tasting like the melon which is typical. Yes. Or the floral that's typical. Yeah. But that'll eventually settle out and be ready for hopefully your December launch dude. Right so that actually makes a lot of sense so it's been a few weeks these wines have been in the bottle and he was saying the winemaker was saying like another six weeks ish and it'll be like dynamite ready to go everything will be dialed in so we're lining things up folks we're lining things up so we're going to taste the saran. We're going to taste the saran next. Next and then we're going to taste the cab. The cab we might I'm going to see if we're going to if we can try this chardonnay. Okay. I don't know if it's ready but we'll find out if so we might jump here and then jump to these guys and that's what we got today. All right so we are we're tasting the chardonnay. Right we're tasting the chardonnay and I'm saying that I'm not really a chardonnay guy because I don't like the where are you. I'm here. But you're the star. The butter bomb vanilla chardonnay and you were like yeah that's nappa shit like we don't do that here. You do what you say. So we go neutral oak and then we add what are called oak stage to it so that we can achieve the oak balance that we want versus the entire barrel when you're using typically a new french oak or something like that it can dominate the grape which then makes it you know you're like oh man I have to alter it in some way to reduce that where we kind of go like start with neutral the grape gets to define where it's at the barrel won't really have an impact on it what we do is add oak staves and oak staves is where if you ever look at the way a barrel's formed each one of these things is a is a state and they're held together by these rings well we're able to take these and decide hey let's put six of them in an oak barrel and how much oak does that impart to the wine and then we're like do we like that balance no we want a little bit more oak add a couple more this way you can add as much as you want to get to the balance you want versus if it was at all this you don't have that same level of control about how much oak is going to be imparted on it and that's just the difference about what central coast is doing a lot with their shards that's really interesting because i'm tasting this and even though that's fairly new in bottle yeah i'm liking where that is and i'm not really a chardonnay fan i generally pass on anything chardonnay but that's that's kind of doing it for me yeah and remember you're and you choosing your wines you're also not necessarily thinking about like what am i going to drink you can be thinking about what your audience wants to drink yeah i got chardonnay lovers where's this at now i get to bring in a different chardonnay that a lot of people sometimes rule out you get to bring one that you like this more universal appeal which means you guys get to find a great wine because of this gentleman right here that's that's actually not bad you guys i'm telling you right now that is that's going to be amazing and not very long from now it's good right now and like i said right now i'm good right now i would take that as is i'm legitimately shocked and surprised of how much i like this chardonnay it's we might this might this might be the one"

        "transcript": " The term fashion, I would say, is generally reserved for the younger demographic, right? It's kind of that young guy's term. But style, on the other hand, doesn't have any age limits at all. And in fact, as men age, style gets to be a tool that helps us project confidence, maturity, masculinity, self-respect, and refinement. And once you get to be 40 and older, dressing well is more about sophistication, authenticity, and comfort. While still sort of keeping your finger on the pulse of what's trending, but the good news is, you don't have to completely overhaul your entire wardrobe, but knowing just a few simple style secrets can make a big difference in elevating your look. One of the most important aspects that older guys should focus on with their clothing is, of course, the fit. And that's why I want to talk about it right up front here, because regardless of how stylish that piece of clothing is, if it doesn't fit you correctly, it just won't look good, period. So know your body type, because understanding your body is critical when it comes to finding clothes that flatter you. For example, if you've gained maybe a little weight around the midsection, you might want to avoid overly tight and overly baggy clothing. Find pieces that provide some structure without being too restrictive and also not being too baggy, because if you're a bigger guy and you're wearing bigger clothes to maybe hide some of your perceived flaws, you'll just end up looking bigger than you actually are. It's challenging and I totally get it, because off the rack clothing probably doesn't fit you as well as you'd like. So understanding tailoring is key. Tailoring can be your absolute best friend, because a good tailor can make small little adjustments that completely transform how that piece fits you, giving it sort of a made-for-you appearance. So maybe you need to shorten the sleeves on something or adjust the length of your trousers, or maybe take in the sides of a jacket. And little tweaks like that can instantly elevate your overall look, no matter what body type you have. I'm going to talk about actual wardrobe items in just a minute, but I want to briefly cover the power of minimalism. So when I say minimalism, it might not be what you're thinking, because what I'm talking about is sort of that less is more when it comes to dressing in a way that's mature, refined and elegant, right? It doesn't mean boring at all. It's more about choosing specific pieces that work together that allow you to mix and match without a lot of effort. Go with neutral color power, it's like black, navy, gray, tan and white, because those are the foundation of a versatile wardrobe. And that type of wardrobe with those basic neutral tones allows you to come up with like a ton of different outfit combinations that all match with fewer pieces, making getting dressed a lot easier and way more efficient. Neutrals also flatter the most skin tones. Invest in quality basics because look, at this point, if you're over 40, you probably don't need or even want a closet jam packed full of a bunch of different clothes. You just need a few high quality basics that interchange with each other like well fitted jeans, nice dress shirts, versatile outerwear and a few versatile shoe options. Also avoid those overly flashy logos and big prints because in my opinion, I just think it's a good idea that men over 40 should probably stay away from big logos and bold prints and patterns because the reason is those types of styles appeal to a younger demographic, which can make you look a little bit gimmicky if you wear stuff like that. Instead, like I mentioned, focus on solid neutral colors or small subtle patterns like small checks or small pinstripes that look more sophisticated. Now let's get into some actual wardrobe pieces that you might want to consider when building a wardrobe foundation. First up, belts. Most men own exactly two belts, a black one and a brown one. And those are fine, but what if you're wearing something like this? Or what if you're wearing something like this? Or what about these? Actually, I have no idea about these. Anson Belt is sponsoring today's video and I have mentioned on numerous occasions that these are basically the only belts I wear anymore. I mean, come on, man, they're good looking with amazing quality. The fit is always perfect. The buckles are interchangeable and they've got colors and styles to match practically any outfit and any shoe. And one of the coolest things about Anson Belt is never having to worry about a bad fit. All of their belts are designed with this little micro adjustment track that always gives you a perfect fit. Traditional belts have holes spaced out one inch apart and they never seem to be in the right place. But these micro adjustments are only spaced out a quarter inch apart. So even if you had too much for dinner, you'll always have a perfect fit. Anson Belts are affordable. They're functional and they always look amazing. They also have a ton of different styles, colors and materials to choose from. The straps come in leather. You can also get canvas, nylon, cloth, micro suede as well as vegan and some other premium limited edition materials. Do yourself a favor and go hit the link down below in the description and go check out everything they have, including their box sets where you can choose three straps and two buckles all for a low price. So maybe you want like all dress belts or maybe you want all casual belts or you want to mix it both. You get to pick the straps and you get to pick the buckles. Go hit the link and find exactly what you're looking for. Okay, let's get into a few wardrobe items that can absolutely elevate your look. And we have to talk about dark denim. A well fitted pair of dark washed jeans is an absolute wardrobe staple, especially for guys over 40. Now I would avoid overly distressed or overly trendy styles that appear a little bit too youthful. Go with a simple, clean, straight cut or slim cut pair in dark blue. These can be dressed up with a sports jacket and loafers or dressed down with a polo shirt and sneakers. Now one step up from denim are of course chinos. These are for those occasions when jeans are just going to be too casual, but then dress pants might be a little bit too formal. Chinos are just that perfect that go between. They're comfortable, they're versatile and they come in a ton of different colors. I would say to go with gray, navy blue, tan and olive. You can pair it up with a button down shirt, a tucked in polo shirt or a sweater for a nice polished look. Also invest in a few good pairs of leather shoes, both dress shoes and sneakers because they'll be worth every penny. A classic pair of oxfords or brogues, I mean that can be worn with everything from those dark wash jeans to a suit. And I would say if you only get one pair of dress shoes, brown is going to be the most versatile. Unless you're going to a funeral or something super formal, then you'll need some in black. Leather sneakers, those are for those casual occasions and if you go high quality, they're going to look good and last you for years. You might also want to consider better quality dress shirts. You can wear it with a suit of course or even with jeans for that sort of smart casual or polished casual look. The key to pulling off this look is making sure the shirt is high quality, fits your body well and is tucked in. Because keep in mind, most dress shirts are made longer in length and they just look really awkward untucked. Go with solid colors or if you want pattern, just keep the pattern subtle. Another item that elevates your look is of course your grooming. Now I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this one, but just make sure you get regular haircuts and make sure any facial hair is kept nice and neat. I've said it before and I'll say it again, but just take a few extra seconds in the mirror and just give yourself a complete once over. If you've got nose hairs poking out that you can actually see, take care of it. If you've got that one long hair that's growing out of the side of your ear, please take care of it. If you've got hair growing down the sides of your neck because they're in between haircuts, take care of it. Grooming is just easy for you to control yourself because it's free and you can do it by yourself in only a few minutes. Something else to consider is fabrics and textures. Fabric technology these days is absolutely incredible, but look for pieces that have some texture and look for materials like cashmere, wool blends and high quality cotton blends. Texture just gives you that extra component of visual interest that elevates your overall look. Embrace your 40s and beyond gentlemen and remember, style and dressing well is a reflection of your own self-assurance. It also helps you project your maturity, sophistication and your confidence. And with that my friends, as always, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Gentlemen, fall is only about a week away if you're watching this video on the day that it's uploaded. And I feel like I've been avoiding fall and fall content for as long as I possibly can, because we are just coming off this incredible heat wave here in Southern California. And I absolutely love the hot weather. However, I also realize that Southern California weather doesn't always exist in other parts of the country. So that's why today we're covering nine fall wardrobe items that I think you need to stock up on for this fall season. First up, we have the wool sweater or some type of cotton blend v-neck sweater or quarter zip sweater. This piece is just so incredibly versatile because you can wear it with practically anything. So if you're wearing a tie, you can wear a sweater over that. If you're going casual with maybe jeans and boots, you can wear a sweater with that also. And if you get something in like wool, cashmere, or some kind of thinner cotton blend, it just wears really comfortable because it's not going to be big and bulky like those cold weather winter cable knit sweaters. I mean, you can go with a t-shirt underneath, a polo shirt underneath, or a long sleeve button down. It all looks great and it's an easy choice. And every guy needs a pair of well fitting dark wash denim. And if you don't have a pair, my friend, this is your sign to head out this weekend and go shopping. Dark wash denim, as I'm sure you know, goes with practically anything and it's an easy item to dress up a little bit and also to dress down. Again, just like we talked about, throw on some boots, a polo, and that quarter zip sweater along with your dark wash denim and your solid. Not only solid, but sophisticated, mature, and masculine. And because I just mentioned boots, I might also add a pair of Chelsea boots or Chaka boots, preferably in suede. Chelsea boots look great either way with suede or like a shiny leather. And brown would be my first color choice and then maybe something like this in a gray suede. But Chaka boots in that style all day long in brown suede. These boots are perfect for this sort of transitional fall weather because it's generally not going to be super hot, but also not too cold yet. They work perfectly with denim or chinos, which we'll get into in just a few minutes. However, if you lean, maybe a little more on the rugged side, grab something in a work boot style or maybe even something like this lace up. Now really quick, before I move on to the next fall items, just because the sun isn't out that much during the fall, that doesn't mean that you get to ignore your skin routine. And I'm sure you know by now that I use T-Changly skincare products every single day because it works for me. And if it didn't, I wouldn't still be using it and buying it every single month. Do yourself a favor. There's going to be a link down below in the description that's going to save you 40%. And if you go through that link, you'll get that 40% off your purchase, plus they'll throw in a free gift with your order. Now I thought a lot about this and my advice would be that if you're just getting started with this, get the level one system because you'll get the daily face wash and exfoliating scrub, a morning moisturizer and a nighttime moisturizer. However, if you just want to level up right from the get go and use the same stuff that I use, get the level three kit because it comes with all of those items plus two more. It comes with an anti-aging super serum and also an eye solution to handle those wrinkles around your eyes. And like I just mentioned, they're giving you 40% off your very first box plus that free gift and then you'll get 20% off for life. And also you can choose that free gift. You can either get the body scrubber that you can use in the shower with your body wash or this premium four piece nail grooming kit. And the beautiful thing is besides looking a lot better, you can pause, cancel or customize all of the components that you want to get at any time. So again, just get started and be on your way to having better looking skin. Go check out the link right down below in the description and get started today and get that 40% off. Thank you T-Channel for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Now let's move on to lightweight jackets. Now these are not your heavy winter jackets, right? These are your sort of thinner lightweight jackets or light quilted jackets. Now this one you're seeing is from Westin Boucher and it's probably my favorite jacket right now. It's got a quilted pattern on the back and the sides and then it's plain on the front. This jacket is just perfect for those cooler evenings. And there's also this one from Peter Manning. Now this one's more like a lightweight puffer jacket, but again, it's not heavy at all and it's actually pretty thin. I mean, I can just throw this thing in the car and then just pull it out later if I'm still out doing something after dark. And both of these jackets are stylish and they're not bulky at all. Then we have the flannel shirt or the flannel over shirt. I mean, you can call it a shirt jacket if you want to because that's kind of how I like to wear these. Once again though, you can just throw this thing in the car and just have it with you if you end up being out later in the evening than you thought. But if you're not a shirt jacket guy, a standard flannel shirt is going to be an absolute no-brainer. Now I'm not sure if they're still making these, but I also have this flannel really thin whale corduroy shirt that I've had for a couple years now from Express. It's got some stretch built into it and it's like just thick enough to handle those cooler fall days. Flannel shirts should be pretty much everywhere right now. So if you want to run out and shop for a few, you shouldn't have a problem finding a pretty good selection. Now staying on shirts besides flannel, the classic denim shirt is another fall must have. And it's sort of strange because I thought I had a dark blue one in my closet, but I must have donated that the last time I did clean out my closet. But right now this is the only denim shirt I have in this light blue color. I have not worn this thing in quite a while, so hopefully when the weather cools off a little bit around here, I can get some more mileage out of it. I think this is the pretty versatile color, but dark blue would be another solid choice. Alright, now I'm just going to throw this one in here and it's a sweatshirt or a hoodie. I know, probably not the most stylish options, but it's just always nice to have something like this when you need it. Now you can find nicer hoodies and here's one that I got once again from Westin Boucher. It's pretty thick actually and it's got some weight to it, but it's more stylish than a standard hoodie. It's got this little detail under the shoulders and you can almost call this like a heavy corduroy. I don't think that's technically what this is, but if you can see this on camera, you get the idea. Now I also have this really thin cotton hoodie from Express that I've had for probably close to 10 years at this point. It has seen better days, but the color is kind of cool and it's nice and thin and lightweight. And I promise we would talk about chinos. So for this category, I would recommend going with slightly darker earth tones. Navy, tan, brown, burgundy, gray and olive are some of those colors I would definitely go for in the fall season. Think about all the colors that you see in fall, right? You've got dark greens. The leaves are turning brown and burgundy. So if you ever have any doubt, these are the colors that you can mimic in your fall wardrobes. Then we have the suede jacket. Now my preference would be the suede bomber jacket. I've got brown suede and I've got some blue suede and they both get a lot of use during the cold weather. Now fortunately for me, it's only cold here about two to three months out of the year, but every chance I get, I love to pull out my suede jacket. It's classic. It looks elevated and it looks fantastic on older guys versus something like a shiny leather jacket. You can go with something like a suede trucker jacket style and once again, darker earth tones are going to look great. Brown, black, blue and olive are going to be a great place to start. And gentlemen, please subscribe if you're not already and as always my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Okay, I have some embarrassing story time coming up later in this video, but first, if you're a single guy or if you've been married for a long time, it's important that you get through this video for a few different reasons. First, I'm going to talk to all you married guys right now. There might be a few things that you've just stopped doing to impress your wife or to spark some of that romance because you just sort of got comfortable. And if you've been married for a long time, some of the things that you did when you were dating just sort of get overlooked at this point. And if you're a single guy and you're out there trying to find that long-term relationship, there might be some things that you're not doing on your dates that you could be doing or at least should be doing in order to stand out from the crowd and let her know that you're somebody different. So, let's get into it. First things first though, you saw the thumbnail and you read the title so you know what you're getting yourself into. And I don't want to hear any BS in the comments about that women should just like me for who I am on the inside and I shouldn't have to impress anybody. That is absolute horse shit. There are people that you need to impress and then of course there are people that you don't need to impress. There's a difference and you should know the difference. And really quick here, I'm not trying to come off like some pompous dirtbag but I'm just tired of comments that I'm getting and emails that I'm getting from all these guys who keep saying it's the other person's fault like it's today's modern women who's the problem. And sure there is going to be a lot of that but most of that new behavior is coming from much younger women. And chances are if you're watching this video, you're at least 40 years old so my guess is you're looking for a woman, a mature woman with a good head on her shoulders, not some immature 22 year old girl. Alright, let's talk about some etiquette that you should know. When she's getting in and out of your car, you open and closed the door for her. 100% of the time when she's getting in and depending on the situation, helping her out can be a little bit optional. So if you park the car and she wakes for you, you walk around and open her door. But if she just gets out on her own, that's fine too. But you always open the door to your car when she gets in. And when it comes to opening a door to like an establishment, like a restaurant, you open the door for yourself, you enter first and then hold the door for her so she can walk in and kind of slide up next to you. First men, open the door and let her enter the room first. Those are good intentions but proper etiquette is you enter the room first. I know though sometimes it can get a little bit weird if there's other people kind of walking in and out at the same time, just do your best when you have that opportunity. Then in a like restaurant situation, you handle the host to stand and check in for your reservation. And when you're being brought to your table, you walk first, not her. Again, if you let her go first, I get it, those are good intentions but it's technically incorrect. You should arrive at the table first so you can pull her chair and get her seated first. After that, then you sit down. And just to back up for one second. When you're walking to your table, hold her hand and lead her. Now, if it's really tight spaces, grab her hand as you're starting to move towards your table and then maybe move your hand back behind you and lead her that way if you're walking like in between some tables. Of course, it all depends on the situation but just try it and do your best. Okay, let me fast forward just for a minute and then we'll circle it back because sometimes when you're on a date, things go better than expected. And I mean way better than expected and you end up back at your place or her place. Are you ready? What is your freshness situation? You better be wearing breathable underwear and you better use some ball powder. Gentlemen, do this right now if you can. Take your hand, jam it down your pants and slide up the side of your balls where they connect to your leg and then smell your fingers. Is it nasty? Do you think she wants to smell that? My apologies for being shocking but shower and use a little bit of ball powder before your date and wear high quality breathable underwear. So cotton is a great natural breathable fiber but it absolutely sucks for underwear and here's why. Cotton underwear fits great like right out of the dryer but after just a short time with you moving around a little bit, they get stretched out and they don't retain their shape. That's why that underwear loses support, looks terrible and gives you a wedgie after like an hour. And that is where silk cut underwear comes in. Gentlemen, I have talked about this brand before and I mentioned that I'm very picky when it comes to the underwear that I actually wear. Now trunks like this are my favorite style and also the style that most women actually prefer. These hands down are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn because they're ultra breathable and they maintain support all day long. Okay, let me try to paint a picture and give you an example of what these feel like. Wearing these almost feels like you're not wearing anything at all because of how thin and soft this material is. These are designed for extreme comfort and support with a sleek seam free design. These are made with these bonded waistbands and these leg openings so it gives you a seamless look underneath all your pants. And you get the perfect balance of support and room right where you need it the most and this amazing silk pouch liner adds an extra touch of style and security. They're made from a blend of micro modality and spandex so they provide comfort, stretch and durability.

And for a limited time, they're giving all of you an amazing offer of 50% off your entire order when you use my code. The link and the discount code are going to be down below in the description. Once again, guys, 50% off your entire order for a limited time. You've got to try these. All right, let's back things up to when you go meet her or you go pick her up. And this applies to whether you're married or single. This is when you give her a genuine compliment and you deliver that compliment with meaning. And with meaning, I mean, if you're feeling it and she looks amazing, say so. Let your mouth drop open and say something like, wow, you look absolutely amazing. You are so stunning. Don't say some generic crap like, hey, you look great. Come on, man, you can do better than that. Use words like stunning, radiant, incredible and glowing. You get the idea. And try to find something specific that you like. So maybe it's the way she has her hair done or maybe it's the dress. Be more creative than just saying, you look great. Everybody tells her she looks great, but you tell her she's stunning. Guaranteed she'll love it. So listen to what she says and then retain that information for later. So if this is a new date, chances are you guys have been chatting a little bit prior to the date and maybe she mentioned something about her family or where she's from. Bring that up again in conversation. Retaining information that she gives you and bringing it up again maybe a few days or weeks later shows that you're listening to her and it signals that what she says is important to you. Something else that has to do with conversation is just letting her talk. Let her go as long as she wants and try not to interrupt her and don't try to win the conversation. So maybe she said something about getting a flat tire. Don't just jump in right away and tell her your story about getting two flat tires. See what I mean? She was telling you a story and you just took all the wind out of her sails. Now I know it's easy because what she said relates to something that happened to you but just try to be aware of it. Alright, these next few are pretty huge and then afterwards I'm going to tell you a very personal embarrassing story that happened to me on a date. But right now we're going to talk about how you treat people. If you treat children, animals and service staff at restaurants with kindness and respect, I'm telling you it's a complete game changer and she will absolutely notice. Here's something else. When you're ordering food, try not to say, can I get? Can I get the tuna? Say, may I have the tuna? Especially if you're at like a nicer place because may I have is a lot more impressive than can I get? Another way to impress her is to be on time and be well dressed. This goes for you. Single guides as well as for all you married guys as well. If you're taking her out somewhere, you know for a fact that she's putting an effort to look good. If she doesn't, that's the red flag in a whole different video. But 99.9% of the time she's getting the hair ready, she's getting the makeup ready, she's put thought into what she's wearing including her shoes and her handbag. Basically every single aspect of her appearance has been thought about. And if you show up in flip flops or a t-shirt, you're completely missing out on all those bonus points that you could have had during that initial first impression. She wants you to look good. I promise in the same way that you want her to look good. She wants to walk into a room with you and have other women be jealous of her. She wants to feel like you care enough to respect her and respect the occasion by putting on your big boy pants and dressing like a man with some self-worth. All right, here we go. It is story time and if you made it this far, I would appreciate you hitting that like button. So all right, I'm out with this young lady who's super cool. I take her to this sort of trendy restaurant with like really cool vibes and we order drinks and a few appetizers to share. She orders the tuna and I ordered the carpaccio. Now the tuna comes out first and goes right in the middle of the table. Now keep in mind this is that fancy raw tuna that's just barely cooked on the outsides. And if you're not familiar, it looks a lot like beef. So I grab a few pieces to put on my plate and then she grabs some for her. And this is where it gets a little bit embarrassing because in full disclosure, at that moment, I didn't know if that was the tuna or just thicker cut carpaccio because generally carpaccio comes out like really, really thin. Anyway, I take a bite and say something funny like, is this land or sea? Now meanwhile, she's over there chewing on her bite and at that exact moment she told me she doesn't eat beef. Oh shit. She gets up from the table, walks over to the bathroom to spit out her bite and at this point I'm thinking this date is completely ruined. But while she's gone, the carpaccio comes out and it looks exactly like it should. So there was no mistaking what that was. So she comes back out obviously looking really embarrassed and I tell her the good news that she just didn't eat beef. It was the tuna. It actually turned out to be kind of a funny moment. But I think the point is I feel like I lost some points because I didn't recognize what was brought to the table. I mean if both items came out together at the same time, it would have been a no brainer. But that's just not what happened. I should have known the difference and I feel like that's on me. Anyway, we both laughed about it and the rest of the date went really well. But the lesson here is when something lands on your table and you're not exactly sure what it is, just ask. And with that gentlemen, please subscribe if you're not already. And as always my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Now, I know I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer. I've never claimed to be. But this is something that I do know. And I want you to listen to me because I know that there is at least one or two of you out there that needs to hear this message today. If you don't like what's going on in your life right now, you have to change and do something about it. Because if you want a result or an outcome that's different than what you've been getting, you have to change your actions and your approach. Now, this is not easy, but it's necessary. Otherwise, it'll lead you to misery. So here's a scenario. You've been seeing failure after failure. You keep getting turned down with new job opportunities. You can't seem to score that date with that quality woman. Your car needs new tires and brakes and you just can't seem to get ahead. It's like one big fat failure right after the other. You must learn to get over things faster and don't keep letting a few bad outcomes sort of spill over into the next one, making everything compound. Every single day is a new chance. Every day that you wake up means that you have another opportunity to make things better. Now look, yes, I can hear myself talking right now and I know this sounds ridiculous. But if all you focus on are the problems in your life, that's what you'll get more of. The universe, whatever you want to call it will give you more of what you focus on. If you focus on problems, you'll get more problems. If you're always stressed out about money and all you think about is how broke you are, you will have more money problems guaranteed. And I know this sounds lame, but hear me out because what I'm about to say worked for me. About seven years ago, I was completely broke and a lot of you know that story already. All I thought about was how broke I was and how it was all my fault and what a loser I was. It was basically devastating, but something that I heard along the way sort of changed everything or at least it helped me to change everything and it went something like this. So say all you have in your bank account is 500 bucks, but your bills add up to more than that. Try to put this one thought into your mind. What would it feel like to open your phone and go into your banking app and see $10,000 in your account? Now, don't think about what you'd go spend it on, but focus on how that would make you feel. What would that feel like and why would you feel that way? Then write those feelings down. And I know this all sounds like hocus pocus, but for me at that time it would have been an incredible feeling and it got me to the point of excitement about actually having that feeling for real and eventually I did. It was right about the time when I was kind of first starting my YouTube channel and I really started focusing on making two videos per week. I did have a little part-time job on the weekends and I worked on my channel during the week. And a few months later I had $6,000 in my bank account. Now it wasn't $10,000, but it was enough money for me to not think about money problems that day. It allowed my brain more room and space to be creative and learn basically how to make better videos that people wanted to watch. That was my number, $6,000. Now a lot of people go buy a watch for $6,000, but for me at that time it was enough money to change my mindset and my life basically at that point. Now for you it might be a completely different number or maybe not a number at all. But in order to change where you're at right now you have to change. Maybe you need to disappear for 60 days and work on yourself. Or on the flip side, if all you do right now is work maybe you need to get out more and learn how to entertain yourself. Find some new experiences that you're liking. Take time to enjoy your own company. Something else you can do to change your own situation is to work on your health and fitness. If you don't like what you see in the mirror you need to work on it. Is it easy? No, but it's not an option. I have seen statistics that show that one of the main reasons older people need to go into assisted living centers is because they can't get themselves on and off the toilet. They don't have enough muscles in their legs and their flexibility is completely shot. I don't know about you but I'm trying to avoid assisted living for as long as I possibly can. Also maybe go take a trip somewhere and see something new. Get out of your town and experience some new surroundings. Personally this helps me get out of a funk. Now it doesn't have to be some crazy trip across the globe but maybe just a weekend staycation in that town that's maybe like an hour away from you. Use that trip as an opportunity to set some new goals for yourself and make a plan on how you can reach those goals. Don't just say that you want to lose 40 pounds and have that as your goal. That's great but that's only one part. How are you going to get there? What steps are you going to take to lose that weight? Are you going to start walking every day? Are you going to go get a gym membership? Are you going to maybe hire a personal trainer? You need the goal and the plan. Now here's another big one and it's eliminating toxic people from your life. Now maybe it isn't necessarily the toxic people but those overly negative people that you just don't like making plans with because all they do is complain the whole time. It's like they suck the joy and energy out of everyone around them and they bring everyone else down. That gets old really fast. Here's another way you can change your situation and it's another big one and it's having a growth mindset. And yes, I hear myself talking, I realize how cliche that sounds but here's the thing. All of life is about growth. Plants grow, bacteria grows, everything grows and if you're not actively growing as in learning something new or reaching for a higher goal or taking steps to be a better person, you're being left behind. For me the key is small consistent steps towards the change that you want to make. As long as you're doing something, something every day to reach your goals, you're making progress because it might be overwhelming to look at 40 pounds and say that's just going to be too hard but start with daily walks. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Purposely, here's what I do, park far away from the entrance to the store so that you have to walk a little bit more. The side benefit I'm telling you from parking far away is there's always good spots and you can avoid door dings. Now here's something else and you can take this or leave this but if you're out there trying to find a relationship and you're not having any success, do this. First, maintain a positive attitude and treat people with the same kindness that you want. I'm telling you from experience, people will respond to you with the same energy that you put out. I swear one of these days I'm going to hire a camera guy to follow me around as I approach people and give people random compliments and then make a video about it but anyway, if you give someone a genuine compliment with a smile on your face without needing anything in return, they will respond to you with the same kindness and thanks. However, if you approach someone wanting something in return, the response is going to be different. If you spend an entire day with the intent of giving out random compliments for no other reason than trying to make other people feel good by the end of that day, you will feel so good you won't even recognize yourself. Too many people are just living with this mindset that their situation is someone else's fault. It's the government's fault. It's your parents fault for not loving you enough when you were 12. It's maybe your ex-wife's fault because she got tired of you and moved out. Listen to me. You won the genetic lottery my friend because your molecules could have made you into a freaking tree or a freaking mosquito. You are a human being with the power to change anything about yourself you want to. Will it take a little bit of work? Absolutely. Nothing worth having comes free. You know this. The life you want is out there. It's waiting for you. Go get it. I don't know man. I'm just so incredibly tired of useless drama and negativity from both men and women who just refuse to look in the mirror and take accountability for their own situation. If I fucked up, I'll be the first to admit it. I will own that and do everything I can to make sure it won't happen again. I won't point fingers at somebody else and say like it was their fault or they made me do it or they're the reason why I acted that way. No. I acted that way because I made that choice. Good or bad. You've got to own it. Now I know this was a bit of a rant today gentlemen but I'm just feeling a little bit spicy today and sick of hearing people complain all the time. But look, if you haven't seen this video yet where I show you guys a bunch of different casual outfits that can work for practically anybody, you've got to go check it out right now because it's basically a big long music video. So with that my friends, I want to thank you very much for watching this video today and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " What's up gang? I'm going to apologize right now in advance if at some point in this video I get a little misty or emotional. There's It's happening right now, so I'm gonna try to get through this. I hadn't really thought Like all the way through this video I just needed to sit down and kind of tell you guys a little bit about what's been going on There has been a lot of changes in my personal life and also in my business life And that's really what I want to focus on the most is the new the new business you guys know that I tease this in a video What about a week or two ago that I was starting a new business and I was really nervous about it but also extremely excited and that's still the case the excitement level though is increasing exponentially because I'm just I'm excited. I've never done anything like this before We were calling it project Dino. Let me explain Project Dino so basically You guys know a lot of you guys know if you've been around for a while I've told the story on a couple of different occasions in different videos that when I was a teenager My older brother committed suicide. We're about two and a half years apart. He was older and That's just that's just been a thing and it's just it sort of comes in goes right When I was a kid, I didn't really understand it until Later in life then it's like that really sucked and it always sucked right but I have always in the back of my I have always wanted to do something to Put his name on something or honor Honor his name and that to me means starting a brand a new business of some kind I have been All over the map in terms of what that new product or service or business what that would look like what that would be You guys I've looked at I've looked at many many different opportunities and many different types of products and services and there's while the passion is there to Tell my story my brother's story and also part of this also gentlemen is to Take some proceeds and give back towards, you know men's mental health mental health in general Suicide prevention program so that's part of the overall the overall goal as well is to give back to Organizations that that need attention and a spotlight and support Looking at all these different business opportunities. It's just It's been a lack of passion, right and it's just been it would have felt like okay Let's put our name on this thing or maybe it's the phone case or why I don't know it just didn't seem It didn't seem legitimate to me And then I had to sort of think about like what am I into? What are some of my hobbies? You know, I'm into some sports. There's two different sports. I'm into I'm into golf and pickleball. Maybe we can do something there and long story short Dino is My brother's nickname Dean Michael was his name Dean Michael Gal Fano and we call them Dino for short Dino so The brand is called Dean Michael and it's going to be a wine business and I am I'm really excited about it. I'm excited about the opportunity. This could be This could be a complete failure Or this could be my future. I have absolutely no idea, but I'm willing to risk it to see Just to see what happens Anyway, I'm gonna try to get through the rest of this video if you're still here man. I appreciate it. I know this is a little bit pathetic but Why wine let's talk about why wine because I've already been hit with You know some comments about Attaching alcohol to mental health and do you think that's a really good idea? I don't I don't think of it that way I don't why Why immediately go towards the negative I don't I don't understand that I'm starting something That I hope will have some legacy. I'm starting something that has meaning to me and my family and it's something that Then I'm relatively passionate about I've talked about you know wanting to join the Somalia program I've taken steps to do that and then had to sort of back away from it due to time constraints I still want to you know at least get through my level one Somalia certification Just to have a little more knowledge under my belt, but I think my my knowledge of wine Currently isn't too bad. I'm an enthusiast. I enjoy the complexities. I enjoy That that that winemakers are essentially farmers like they're they're chemists These are very creative people that are doing really creative things and making a really Amazing product from year to year and it's just I don't I find it fascinating. I've never done anything with This much potential for Something awesome and also something that could crash and burn in public. We'll see I'm but again like I said I'm willing to risk it. I want to do this. I have to do this if I didn't do this now I would I Would regret this for the rest of my life. So I have to do this. I have to do this Let me let me tell you I'll tell you a little bit about the sourcing where the fruit's coming from the facility There's gonna be some videos coming up where I'm gonna head up there. We're flying up actually To check out this there's gonna be a whole bunch of videos that are gonna come With some backstory and some more information. I'm excited to take those videos Get up there to Central Coast, California and start making some more content, but in terms of more content I'm not gonna flood this channel with a lot of behind-the-scenes Label making production facility, you know a bottle design I'm not gonna flood you guys with all of that because that just seems It just seems a little too much. So what I'm doing I do have a membership Platform section on YouTube. There's a join button if you're interested join the membership There's a fee a monthly fee to be a part of that But I'm gonna I'm gonna be going crazy with videos in that thing. We're and and with that I Want your help? Specifically with some label design ideas. I've got a few designs and I'm sort of playing with but I want something a Little more professional From a third party to take my ideas. What can you do with my ideas? Anyway, so I'm gonna be posting some videos about that label design behind-the-scenes stuff Get excited. Please get excited about this because I'm I Haven't been this excited for a very long time about really anything. So this is it's cool and I Know this video is a little bit scattered And all over the place I knew I wanted to sit down and film something to let you guys know what's happening. Let me tell you a little bit about The production facility so we are sourcing our fruit from one of the best regions in the US and that's Central Coast, California fruit quality up there is Next level this is Central Coast Santa Ynez. This is where you have or I have The option to choose warm weather climate fruit and also cool weather climate fruit But for example Pinot Noir, I'm in Temecula Valley, California. We can't grow Pinot Noir here. It's just too hot It doesn't work. There are some wineries that try to do it But it ends up being more like a granache than a Pinot Noir But up there you've got a whole different climate zone and we can actually source and make Pinot Noir I'm excited. We are hoping to launch and when I say we I've got I've got two partners. I've got Basically two business partners that are running that facility that I am partnering with and they're helping me do this from basically a to b They're handling distribution for me. They're handling labeling for me because here's the thing in order for me to be John the wine guy I Have to have a liquor license and if I'm gonna sell alcohol to different states I need state approval from every single state that I want to sell into and each of those states is a whole different animal and Expense just California. I think it's like 1,800 bucks, right? Just to get a liquor license to sell in California Times that by 46 states that allow sales to come into their come into their states and then there's warehousing distribution Website all of that stuff. So basically this is these guys are helping me do all of that and I could not be Any happier to have that type of partnership and that type of help especially Starting at zero where I'm starting from with a huge idea and a lot of smaller ideas that involve this brand So anyway, that's that's gonna be a really cool thing and I'm excited to see where this goes But from what I've seen so far and what I have tasted so far It's it's really good. You guys are gonna absolutely love it if you love wine or even like wine or Want a glass of or I'm sorry. I want a bottle of wine for the holidays Stay tuned. I hope to launch By Thanksgiving that is a big ask it might be December. I'm not sure yet There's a lot of things that still has to this still have to be approved for example labels Every label on a bottle of wine needs to get state approval If I come out with four different types of wine That's four thousand dollars and four weeks to get approval on all of those labels. So Yes, like a thousand dollars per label in four weeks for it to get through state approval So that's a lot to think about what do I want to launch with there's a lot of unsan't unanswered questions So there's still a lot of back and forth that we need to you know do yeah The goal is to launch this season by the holidays. I really I need to launch by the holidays So I'm gonna do everything I can whether it's we launch with Four Varietals four wines or maybe we only launch with two. I don't exactly I don't know yet. We're gonna find out but anyway What else I've got some notes. I feel like I've been all over the place. What else has been going on I think that's kind of what I had for today Yeah, like I said, I don't want to spam this channel with a lot of the business stuff that I'm doing so if you don't mind if you want to support me at all and if you want to get in on Some of the behind-the-scenes and some of the decision-making that I'm gonna need your help with join the membership site and Get excited get excited I'm excited and I hope you'll support Me and the brand once it's launched Anyway, it would uh, Jesus, it would mean a lot to me.

        "transcript": " It's sort of funny actually, but this video virtually came out of nowhere. So I was doing some research on a completely different video topic idea and I came across an article that talked about older guys and how they have sexier traits than younger guys. So obviously being in the business of men's lifestyle, it sparked my interest and I went down the rabbit hole. And I must say it's a pretty good sized rabbit hole with really just a lot of different thoughts and opinions from a lot of different articles and blogs. So what I wanted to do was sort of streamline what I read and basically talk about some of the highlights in this video. So look, it's no secret that older men have a huge advantage over younger guys when it comes to dating and finding female companionship and partnership. The difference between what we have, what we offer and what we bring to the table is just so night and day over younger guys that it's not really even worth comparing because the gap is just enormous. But with that said, the first trait that older guys have that women find sexy is having the ability to effectively communicate when your boundaries are being crossed. Effective communication isn't necessarily though just drawing a line in the sand and saying it's my way or the highway because that's just sort of taking it too far. So if you're dating somebody brand new and something triggers you or one of your boundaries gets crossed or close to being crossed and you communicate that with her with tact and intelligence, most of the time it's going to be appreciated and just fine. However, if she turns it into an argument about how you were triggered and how that's your problem, you just found a major red flag and you can do with that whatever you want. Now that brings us to the next trait that women find sexy and it's understanding your boundaries. And I think this is really good, but I would add that I mean fully understanding your boundaries like why you have them, what triggers them, how to deal with them and how to communicate those triggers effectively. So again, if you're dating somebody brand new and something comes up in conversation that approaches one of your boundaries, it's okay to communicate that. With that said though, the communication needs to happen with respect and understanding because she didn't know that was one of your triggers. Maybe try to tastefully explain your previous experience in a way that doesn't make her feel embarrassed for bringing something up unintentionally because again, she doesn't really know that much about you yet. So maybe you go into a little story time and talk about how something similar was like a major problem for you in the past. Again, you should fully understand what your triggers are and then know how to communicate those to somebody else. The next sexy trait that older guys have is understanding style. But here's where things get a little interesting because it seemed to be a little more nuanced. So not only should men know how to dress well, but also understand when to wear certain things. All right, for example, I was having a conversation with someone recently and she'd said that she goes to a lot of these really high profile events for the business that she's in and she doesn't want to bring a man to these events on her arm who might appear to be a little out of place and even a little bit embarrassing. Now, before you get upset or offended by that, please understand that that's not being shallow. That is having minimum standards of what she's looking for. And there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. We all have standards. So literally just last week, I made a whole video on dressing in what I like to call polished casual and I showed a ton of different outfit combinations. And in that video, I wore this exact shirt. This is the new brand new Maranello Retro Stripe Polo from Collars & Co. And I'm telling you guys, this thing fits like absolute perfection. It's lightweight, it's breathable, it's made with a premium cotton and silk blend and it's got ribbed cups and a lower hem so you can either wear it untucked or you can easily tuck it in. You can also get this in a buttonless Johnny Collar style. Now something else that fits like perfection is their Montana long sleeve button up shirt and their new Maverick blazer with this stretch fabric. And with fall coming up, these are going to be perfect. Collars & Co is sponsoring today's video and you probably already know about all their dress collar polo shirts that have built in collar stays so the collar always looks great. But if you haven't been to their website for a while, they've got some really cool brand new pieces. They've got lightweight quarter zip sweaters. They've got some really good looking knit blazers. They've got outerwear, pants, shoes and basically everything that you might need to expand your wardrobe from head to toe day to night. I'm going to drop a special link down below in the description and if you go through that link, you're going to get a discount on anything you want to go pick up from their website. And I really do encourage you guys to go surf around the website and see all the new stuff they have because I'm sure you're going to find something that you need like this polo. Hit that link and go check out everything they have because the quality, the fit, the feel is absolutely amazing. Thank you Collars & Co for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, here's another trait that older men have that women find sexy and this one has sort of caught me off guard and it's having a tight circle of friends. I found this pretty interesting and the article I was reading suggested that men who had a lot of acquaintances were attractive but if they only had a few really tight close friends, they found those guys even more sexy. I mean let's just take me for example just for kicks. So I have a ton of acquaintances. There's a lot of people in my social circle and I enjoy every second of time that we spend together out doing crazy stuff. But if I sit back and really think about it, I probably have one to maybe two really close friendships. These are the guys that I would go to battle for. Now this next one is also pretty interesting but it actually makes a lot of sense and it's having the ability and the self-awareness to just let her talk. Don't try to fix anything she might be talking about and avoid trying to win the conversation. Here's what I mean. Maybe she says something about a crazy family member, right? We've all got those. But avoid trying to top her story with your story about your super crazy family member. Again, don't try to win the conversation. All right, the next trait that older guys have that women find very sexy is kindness. I've talked about this quite a lot before in other videos and there's a big difference between being a nice guy and a kind man. I would even say this one for me would be on my short list for traits in women that men find attractive. I have been at dinner tables with people who treat the service staff like absolute trash and that is in my opinion one of the ugliest human behaviors that I think I've ever seen. There's literally no need for it. It's just so easy to be kind to people, like be kind to everyone. Let the guy go in traffic. Let somebody go in front of you in line at the grocery store with only a few items. Hold the door for people. Smile. Give random compliments. Give people how you want to be treated because nobody wants to be treated poorly so just stop doing it because you're not impressing her at all by putting other people down. You're only showing her how ugly you can be. Okay, another sexy trait that older guys have is having emotional intelligence and having the ability to regulate your emotions and not be overly reactive. I actually just talked about this in a video last week and here's the thing. Babies and little kids scream and cry when they don't get their way or when they're upset about something. As we get older, the more we should be able to regulate those emotions so you don't run around acting like an overgrown child. If you stay calm and collected when things get stressful, that's one sign of having high emotional intelligence which women clearly find sexy. The next trait that women find very sexy is having hobbies and healthy outlets for yourself outside of their relationship. Maybe for you it's going to the gym or playing golf or learning a new instrument, whatever it might be. If you just go to work, come home, go to bed and rinse and repeat every single day, unfortunately my friend, you're going to be viewed as kind of boring. Think about it, women are attracted to men who have stuff going on and if you live an interesting life and you're physically and socially active, she's going to want to be part of your life because you're out there having a fun and interesting life. And also consider that one of the first things most people talk about on first dates is like, so hey, what do you like to do for fun? What are your hobbies? What do you like to do when you're not at work? And if you can't answer that question with some of your hobbies and some of your activities, again my friend, you'll be viewed as a little bit boring. And with that gentlemen, please consider subscribing if you're not already because I would love to have you part of the Legends family. Thank you so much for watching, live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Alright gentlemen, a different video lined up for you guys today. So what I'm about to show you is a series of outfits that I have been wearing recently. Pretty much since about the spring and all summer long. This is, I guess you'd call this my outfit of choice recently. And I've been wearing outfits just like this in these basic combinations. If I've got a dinner that I'm going to or an event that I'm going to, I tend to do a lot of events and outings. And this is kind of what I've been running with. And I like to call this polished casual. I don't know if anybody else uses that term or maybe elevated casual. I don't know. I like the term polished casual. It seems to work for me and how I like to, how I like to dress. This is basically to hopefully give you guys some ideas or inspiration. If you're struggling with maybe like your date night outfit or something like that. So maybe take a look at your closet and see if you can replicate anything that I'm about to show you in this video. So let's dive in. I'm going to roll the music and we'll get started."

        "transcript": " At its core, attractiveness is the ability to draw people towards you. Now, whether that's through your physical appearance, your personality, or your behavior. Now, it's not only about looking a certain way, but more about how you care yourself and how you interact with other people and how you make them feel. And also, attractiveness is subjective and of course it varies from person to person. However, there are some undeniable universal traits that most people will genuinely perceive as attractive. Like kindness, confidence, and a sense of purpose. Okay, first things first though, let's address the elephant in the room and that's of course physical attractiveness. But again, this can vary from person to person because we all just kind of like what we like. But taking care of your body through exercise, diet, and grooming goes a very long way because it not only improves your general overall appearance, but it also signals that you're healthy, that you have discipline, and that you can handle commitment. Because committing to a healthy lifestyle is generally the more difficult path to take. Attractiveness also comes from our own individual personal style. Again, subjective. But here's something that I want you to think about. Changing your appearance with the clothes that you wear is the easiest thing you can do to be more attractive, especially as a man. It basically comes down to this. Wear better looking clothes and you'll instantly be more attractive. It's really that simple. I mean, think about how easy that is and then think about all the steps that women have to go through, right? I mean, women have the hair, the nails, the lashes, the makeup, the shoes, the dress, the accessories, the whole thing. But all you really need to do to start being viewed as more attractive is to wear nicer clothes. I'm closing in on 900 videos on my channel and the majority of those videos are about style and fashion for men over 40. So if you need somewhere to start, just click on one of my playlist and grab some popcorn. But I don't want to just leave it at that. I want to give you two places to start right now. First, your shoes. Wear nicer shoes. If you're a work boot guy, maybe wear nicer versions of work boots when you're out somewhere like not at work. Maybe you're a sneaker guy. But you don't have to wear nicer sneakers. You don't have to wear dress shoes all the time. You get the idea. So the next place to start is with your belt. I know, sounds very simple, but most men own exactly two belts, a black one and a brown one. I mean, those are good and you should have those. But what about everything in between? Because black and brown don't necessarily go with everything. Now, if you've been around for a while, you know that I'm a huge fan of Anson Belt and Buckle. I have been supporters of my channel from the very beginning. And I think it was about six or seven years ago when I first talked about Anson Belt on my channel. You guys, I did this whole video shoot out in the sand dunes, running around barefoot, wearing a couple of different suits. So if you haven't seen that video, it's a pretty quick one. It's different, but I'll leave the link for you down below. Anson Belt is sponsoring today's video and I have mentioned on multiple occasions that these are basically the only belts that I wear anymore. They're good looking, they're amazing quality. The fit is always perfect. The buckles are interchangeable and they've got colors and styles to match any outfit and any shoe. And one of the coolest things about Anson Belt is never having to worry about a bad fit. All of their belts are designed with this little micro adjustment that always gives you a perfect fit. I mean, if you think about it, traditional belts have their holes spaced out one inch apart and they never seem to be in the right place. But these micro adjustments are spaced out a quarter inch apart. So even if you're wearing like a thick pair of jeans or really thin slacks or trousers, you'll always have a perfect fit. Anson Belts are fashionable. They're functional and affordable. They also have a ton of different styles and colors and materials when it comes to their belt combinations. The straps come in leather, canvas, nylon, cloth, microsweat as well as vegan and some other premium limited edition materials. I'm telling you guys, hit that link down below in the description and go check out their box sets of three straps and two buckles that you can choose for yourself. So I would say do like one leather dress belt and then two casual canvas belts and be well on your way to looking more attractive. Thank you, Anson Belt for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Okay, one more quick thing about style and how that relates to overall attractiveness. And then we're going to move on to some other meteor topics. How you dress communicates a lot about who you are. It communicates how much you value yourself. It communicates if you pay attention to details. It communicates self-confidence, self-worth and self-respect. And when you boil it all down, the simple fact is people who dress better are viewed as more attractive. It's that simple. All right, we covered physical attractiveness and we've covered clothing. So now let's dig in just a little bit deeper and talk about emotional intelligence. People who fly off the handle when the smallest little things go wrong are viewed as having low emotional intelligence. But if you're able to manage your emotions and remain cool when things start to go sideways, you will be viewed as having higher emotional intelligence. So maybe over the next couple of days or a few weeks, just monitor yourself and take a look at how quickly you raise your voice in arguments. Do you remain chill or do you get really heated and raise your voice very quickly? Here's the thing. It's not about being the loudest guy in the room. I mean, maybe somebody spilled some red wine on your pants. Sure, that might suck, but they make more pants. It's not the end of the world. So here's another way to think about it that might hit home. So think about it this way. Babies and toddlers yell, scream and cry when they don't get what they want or when they're upset. The older we get, the more we should be able to regulate those emotions so we don't act like overgrown toddlers. If you stay cool and collected when things get stressful, you have higher emotional intelligence and that's attractive. Another trait that's viewed as attractive is a genuine interest in other people asking questions and conversation and not over talking. So here's a personal story. Last weekend, I took myself out for dinner at one of my favorite little cocktail lounges. I'm sitting there at the bar and a guy comes up to me and says he recognizes me from my YouTube channel and he just wanted to come over and say hi. We had a nice chat. We took a couple of pictures and then he went back to his table where his wife was sitting with some of their friends. After maybe 10 or 15 minutes or so, I was feeling kind of spicy, so I sent their table champagne. They were all very thankful and they waved me over to say thank you. I went over and I ended up sitting with these guys for probably the next two hours or so just getting to know them and enjoying conversation. But here's the thing though. So at one point, they were asking me about my channel and how I started it and why. So I began talking about all of that. But after a couple of minutes of talking, I kind of realized how much I was actually doing all the talking and not asking questions about their lives. Now, of course, they did ask me those questions and I was answering. But after a few minutes, I just wanted to shift the conversation away from me and learn more about them. So I guess the point is having enough self-awareness to realize that you're the only one that's been doing all the talking for a while is a good thing. But of course, we all like to talk about ourselves, but after a while, it gets to be old. So be a good listener and shift the conversation back to them. Ask them some questions and get them talking about themselves. Because having a genuine interest in other people enough to want to get to know them better is another very attractive trait. Another attractive trait is, of course, confidence. But this is where I think a lot of people get it wrong because sometimes having confidence means admitting that you don't have all the answers. Think about it like this. Isn't it easier to just admit that you're not an expert on a given subject than it is to put on a whole show trying to fake it? So other people like you or think that you're smart because the thing is most people can see right through that act. With that said, though, I believe that confidence comes from having been there and done that. It comes from experience and also expertise. It's also kind of this fearless attitude that even if you fail at something, it's all good. For example, like when you walk up and approach that woman and get rejected, no big deal. You didn't know her a minute ago, so you're right where you started. But you also had confidence to go talk to her in the first place. It's all good. Confident signals that you're comfortable with who you are and it conveys the message that you are trustworthy. It's not about being arrogant and announcing to the world that you are confident. It's more about having a quiet assurance in your abilities and your self-worth. Something else that's attractive is knowing what you're about and knowing who you are. It's about knowing your values and your boundaries and understanding and knowing what you're trying to achieve and having a plan to achieve it. And that is the advantage of being older, my friends, because younger guys just haven't quite figured that out yet. They're still trying to play the chameleon to fit in everywhere. Men in their 20s and 30s will, say, find a new girlfriend and then immediately change who they are to fit into what she's looking for. They haven't figured out who they are yet, but older guys have been there, done that, we've played those games and we're done with it. We're on a whole different trajectory and most of us are still building something. We still have strength and energy to make should happen, reach our goals and achieve a lot more. We're not dead yet. And I would say, in a lot of ways, at this point in life, this is when a lot of us wake up. I'll leave it there for now, gentlemen, but if you're new here, please consider subscribing. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " What's going on gang? Last minute Q&A video coming your way right now so let's go ahead and dive in. But before we get going I want to let you know that all these questions come in from Instagram. So just yesterday I put out an Instagram story saying ask me anything. So that's where all these questions come from. I'm going to try to get through a bunch of them. Some aren't really that appropriate so I'm going to get through as much as many as I can and I will try not to ramble. If you guys have seen some of my other Q&A videos I tend to kind of go off on tangents and I'm going to try not to do that today. So let's dive right in and we'll keep this video relatively short. What are you driving now? I have a 2022 C8 Corvette Stingray. It's a really cool car. I like it. Some people really don't like the Corvette because they think it signals like midlife crisis or older guy and whatever. I totally understand that because I resisted the Corvette for a long time but I got to say bang for the buck. And I've said this before it's hard to beat the Corvette platform. But yeah that's what I got. Can a classy guy still wear muscle shirts? Sure in the gym or if you're exercising or hiking or doing something athletic. Sure absolutely. Why would you choose to wear that shirt out in public or out somewhere, out to dinner, out to lunch, right out to whatever you're doing? Why would you choose that shirt? I think that's more my question. Are you trying to signal and show people that you're healthy and you're fit and you're muscular? I mean that's the question right because there are other ways, more classy ways to do that and to show how fit you are without wearing a sleeveless shirt right? I mean you could wear a more fitted polo, a more fitted henley, something like that. But muscle shirts in the gym totally fine. Okay I guess nothing's off limits. How much do you make with your YouTube channel? I talk about this. I make videos every single year around January, early February where I release my earnings report from YouTube. So if you're curious go back and look at some of my January, February videos and you'll find the last couple years where I have given out that information. Nice watch, share your watch collection. So in the Instagram story, I don't have it on right now, but I'm wearing my Tudor Black Bay GMT. Share my watch collection. Maybe in an upcoming video, we'll see. Your videos are very inspiring for men above 40. Keep them coming and stay blessed. Thank you. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that because I mean this is quite frankly a lot of work. It is a full-time job and I don't know how it looks on like your end. You see me sitting here making these you know eight to ten minute videos and that's all you see. But that video took me the entire day to make right? I've got to write the script. I've got to do the research. I've got to film. I've got to edit. I've got to make the thumbnail. I've got a keyword. I'm not complaining. Not at all. But I will yeah, that's just it's a lot of work. So thank you. Okay if you could go on vacation anywhere, where would it be and why? Europe specifically Italy. I've never been to Europe. I've never been to Italy. I'm half Italian. Sicilian to be exact. So I would love to go spend some time in Europe and Italy. You look great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay had to make a quick trip to the garage for this next one. What cleaning products are you using on the car? All right let me just run down a couple things. So I recently bought an electric pressure washer and that's been kind of a game changer. It's got the cool foam cannon and everything on it. So I went and got a bunch of this chemical guys. Mr. Pink, I've heard lots of good things about chemical guys. I've got their wheel cleaner. You can see the wheel cleaner. I've got this. If you're interested, I'll put Amazon links for you if you want to go check some of this stuff out. I'll leave those in the description. McGuire's quick detailer in between washes. I've also got the California car duster and a bunch of microfiber stuff and this is what I use on the tires. If you can see that this Mr. Wet. Black Magic tire wet. It works pretty good. So that's kind of a basic rundown. I've got some you know window cleaner and some stuff and brushes and things like that but this is I guess the majority of the cleaning products. This next one is from my buddy Ryan and he's asking favorite restaurant in Temecula. I don't know that I have a favorite. I would say Gourmet Italia ranks pretty high. Great Italian food, great atmosphere on the weekends. They've got this like fortified piece jazz band. Those guys are amazing. So I always like to try to sit on the bar side. I saw you there about two months ago I think. Gabbling Cowboy is good for steak. Journey at Pachonga. I've been out there a couple times recently and when my buddy was in town I took him out there. Pretty pretty cool. I like that one. And speaking of Pachonga, the steakhouse. Great oak. I think yeah it's great oak steakhouse inside Pachonga, inside the casino. Fantastic. Like that places I don't know what it is. It's got to be like a five star experience. I've had amazing food there. I haven't been for a little while but I need to go back because it is fantastic. Oh boy here we go. Gay or straight. I am 100 straight. I do like women. Camilla or Trump. I am not even going to go there. Would you ever wear a Bolo tie or western style clothes? It's just not my thing. If I were to do that I would feel uncomfortable. I would feel awkward. I would feel like I would be wearing like a costume right? It just wouldn't feel quite right. Not that I've got anything against western apparel. Not at all. I think for me it would just feel awkward because it's just not what I identify with. The style that I identify with. So I would feel a little bit out of place. But yeah. When was the last time you played golf? Oh my god. It has been a minute. It has been a year. I don't know. It's probably been about a year. I haven't touched my clubs. I keep thinking that I want to get fit. I want to go to a fitting center and get fit for some new irons. My driver's great. My three-woods awesome. Putter's still cool. Wedges are good. It's just my irons. Like three through pitching wedge. I would kind of... I've had my clubs for a long time. They got to be 15, 20 years old at this point. And I know this new technology. I was waiting for the new Mizuno 245s to come out. The 225s. The 245 is a replacement for the 225. And I'm hearing lots of good things. I'm seeing a bunch of reviews on YouTube and they look amazing. But I want to go get fit for the right set. The right angle. All of the things. Lying angle. Loft. All the things. But I want to work on my swing before I go get fit. So I need to get my ass up to the range. You may have answered this before. What makes you do what you do? I'm pretty sure that's what you meant. What makes you do what you do? When I started making YouTube videos, it was a hobby, right? And it was just... The YouTube videos were a way to send traffic back to my website. Because that's where everything was. I was a blogger. That's all I really did. What I realized when I made the YouTube videos is that people really latched on. Because at that time, there were no other men making lifestyle content for men specifically over 40. Like I was it. And I think that's why I grew as quickly as I did. So it was just... I'm the guy whose hobby sort of accidentally turned into a full-time job. And I'm super grateful and thankful for that. Why have I continued though? I love it. I love it. I feel like in a lot of ways I was put on this planet to help people. Yeah. And that's why I do it. That's why I keep doing it. I mean, am I going to make everybody happy? No. I'm on here just promoting my opinion as usual. My opinion. And just to self-improve, right? That's what this channel is all about. And that's why I keep doing it. Motley Crew or Poison? Man, I don't know. I don't know. Motley Crew goes back a lot longer. I don't know. I like them both. I really like both of those bands. If I had to choose though, I'd probably go Motley Crew. Favorite underwear? Lots of options. I know. Dude, it's endless, the amount of underwear. It's like t-shirt companies. There are so many brands that claim to make the best t-shirt. And there's also a million brands claiming to make the best underwear. I would say for me, so I've got these new silk cut underwear. And I did a promo for them. So this isn't part of that at all. I'm just saying that what they sent me is really, really good. I also have some Calvin Klein steel micro trunks. You can get them on Amazon. If I find them, I'll link to those down below too. I'm a trunk guy. I'm not really a brief guy. And I'm not like a boxer guy. I'm not a boxer brief guy. I don't like how far down the boxer briefs go down my thighs. I like trunks. It's what's most comfortable for me. So yeah, those are my two favorite brands at the moment. What's your 2024 goal? Maybe you missed my videos. So I make goal setting videos every single year, at the beginning of the year. So around January, I make those videos. Go back and look, you'll probably see them from the last couple of years. It's basically a recap, a revisit of my goals for the following year. And like, did I reach those goals that I set for myself last year? Yes or no? If I didn't, let's try to move forward and continue to try to reach those goals for this year. Anyway, I do those videos every single year. Some men wear their pants above the ankle. That's not the proper length for a suit, isn't it? Yes and no, it's a style preference, right? Do you wear slim fitting suits? Not skinny. I'm not talking about skinny. Slim fit suits versus like classic cut. Do you want a cuff on your pant leg or no cuff? It's a style choice, right? So I don't, above the ankle seems to me to be a little bit too short for suit pants. I've got some casual trousers that are a little bit, you know, when I wear them with a loafer, my entire ankle is sort of there, right? And I don't necessarily mind that, especially where I live here in Southern California. It's hot during the summer and the summer evenings get pretty, stay pretty warm too. So if I'm going to go out somewhere on a Friday night, Saturday night, you know, somewhere nice to a nice dinner, I'm not going to wear shorts, right? I want to wear some nicer pants. And some of those happen to be cut a little bit shorter. It's just a style preference. If you left the West Coast and moved east, where would you go? I don't know. I've been to Atlanta a few times. I did like, I did like Atlanta. I've been to Florida a few times. I haven't been, I've been up to Maine once. Haven't been to New York or anything like that. But it probably somewhere in Florida, I would have to guess just based on my travel experiences, either Atlanta or Florida, because I've been there. I've been to those two places and that's kind of all I know. Got any videos on how you style your hair? Conditioner, blow dry, styling products, etc. Yeah, I have done, I've done a few of those actually. If you go way back in my videos, look for a video called embrace your gray. I talk about, I know it's a couple years old, my hair was a lot poofier and longer back then. It's funny to go back and look at the, look at that video. But I do sort of go into detail there with products I use. I've made some more videos recently, the blow dryer video. But yeah, there are videos out there on my channel. But right now, I used a Leifenswift blow dryer. I use, what is it, the Laywright Cement Clay for a styling product. And that's kind of it. That's basically it. There are some other little peripheral things that I use every now and then. There's an argon oil that I put in my hair when it's still wet. Shampoo changes all the time, conditioner changes all the time. But I do use also a purple shampoo about every two, I'm sorry, two to three times per week to keep the kind of silver, the silver so it doesn't get yellow. But that's that's about it. Your go to sense, tough one because I like to have a daytime and a nighttime like I like to have two. But I would say based just just solely on what I have in my fragrance collection, you ready for this? It's probably not what you expect. Mont Blanc Legend Spirit, if you guys can see that. This is just your go anywhere, do anything. It's crowd pleasing. It's fresh ish, but also rich as well. So it could, it works. It just, it just works for every single thing. Now, is it the most expensive smelling? Is it the most interesting? No, it does smell a bit synthetic. But I've probably received more comments or compliments, I should say, wearing this than anything else I own. I have received compliments. I've got some Tom Ford stuff. I've got a couple of Creed fragrances and those are, as you know, very, very nice. If I had to choose one, I guess this would be it. All right, I had to come back because I do have one more, I thought about it and I do have one more scent that could be kind of your do anything, go anywhere. And it's kind of a new one for me. It's Zhezhev, Naxos. It's got a little bit, a little hint of a floral note in the same way that like Tom Ford Black Orchid has a little bit of florals. It's still a super masculine fragrance. So don't let that put you off. Go smell Tom Ford Black Orchid and you'll kind of get similar vibes from this, although this is not as dark as the Tom Ford. But anyway, another go to go anywhere, one fragrance for life kind of situation. Oh boy, is marriage still an option for you? Anything's an option. Is that something that I want for myself? I don't know. I don't know. I honestly, I don't know. I've been married. I'm divorced. I honestly don't know. I just don't. That's not an answer that you're probably looking for. I just really don't know. Real teeth. Yes and no. Basically, my forefront upper teeth are veneers. And I will say, I have developed a lisp. I'm sure you probably heard me talk enough to where you can kind of identify that I slur a little bit on my esses. And that's why. I don't know what happened. Let me back up. In my early 40s, I had braces, right? I didn't like my teeth. They were all jacked up. I wanted a better looking grill. So I got these braces, but they were six month smile is what they were called. So they didn't go all the way back. They went like halfway back, both front, top and bottom. And it was just to correct misalignment. It wasn't bike correction, anything like that. After I got out of braces, I got veneers on my four front upper teeth. One of my teeth in the front, I don't know which one it was, was dead. I got on a bike accident when I was a kid. I had a root canal. The tooth was dead and it was discoloring. So there's nothing you could really do to match that color to my other teeth. So it was let's get veneers. So we did. My canines were like really funny shape too, really sharp. Anyway, so that the answer is yes and no, but I hope that helps. One more quick word on the teeth thing. It's that since I've had the braces and the veneers, that's when I developed this list that I seem to have right now. It's frustrating. But it is what it is. I don't know really what I could do about it at this point. I think my teeth just got sort of narrowed or something or my tongue's too big for my mouth. I have no idea. But it is what it is. But that's all I've got for you guys. Thank you so much for watching. Enjoy the rest of your day, weekend, week, afternoon, evening, whatever it is for you. Thanks so much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Today I want to talk about some overrated items and rules that appear in menswear. Now, I'm probably going to get some pushback on some of these and that's fine. This is just my opinion. But if you have a rational counterpoint against some of these things I'm going to talk about in this video, I welcome your rational comments down below. Now these are in no particular order, but the first overrated item in menswear in my opinion are cross body bags. I get it though, it's a place to put all your stuff just like a purse. So let's go back a few years to the fanny pack. Now these got really popular in like the late 90s and early 2000s, but just within a matter of a few years they became a punchline and they still are. So fast forward to just a few years ago and these things started gaining massive popularity among the younger generation and they started wearing them a little bit differently. So instead of wearing them like a belt around your waist, guys were wearing them over one shoulder and across their torso. And we also can't forget that it was all about the luxury brand names which we'll get to in just a minute. And it got to the point where you were seeing these things literally everywhere, but at least for me. I just never really understood the hype. I mean I get it, it's the place to put your stuff, but how much stuff are you actually carrying as a man? Now personally for me, I carry the key fob for my car, my phone and my wallet. And all of that stuff fits pretty nicely in either my pants pockets or my jacket pockets. And for the record, I'm not necessarily saying this is a bad thing and you shouldn't use one, but I guess what I am saying is at least in my opinion they look absolutely terrible. And it's just one of those menswear accessories that I believe is way overrated. And speaking of luxury brands, that's also overrated in my opinion. Now a couple years ago it was all about the flashy big brand logos and it was almost like this big flex that you were able to afford like a $900 Gucci t-shirt. Now currently the whole quiet luxury trend is happening where all those sort of overly obvious luxury logos are just no longer in style. And I am a huge fan of that. I've never been into the big logos. With that said, however, luxury brands are able to pivot pretty quickly and tone down the look of some of their pieces. But even with that, luxury brands and wearing luxury brands still seems to be a pretty big flex. But listen, you can be stylish and relevant without going broke buying luxury brands. I mean, you can go to the mall right now and head up stores like Macy's Express and Nordstrom and buy an entire wardrobe for probably less than what it would cost for a shirt and a pair of shoes from some luxury brand. Again, completely overrated. And because I just mentioned shoes, another completely overrated menswear item are chunky loafers and dad sneakers. This whole look has never really done it for me and I can almost guarantee you that in maybe like a year or two from now, we'll look back on this stuff and just laugh and wonder what the heck we were doing. My advice is to stick with the classics, especially if you're over 40. We're talking streamlined round to toe dress shoes, streamlined classic loafers and minimal clean design leather sneakers, just like these right here. Here's the deal. These are brand new from Thursday sneakers and they were nice enough to sponsor today's video. I've been wanting a shoe just like this from Thursday for a long time and they finally did it. So check this out. So they do have the premier low top that you can get in all white and they come with metal eyelets for the laces. Awesome shoes. I've got some and it's a nice casual option. Now another brand new option is the court model. Now these come in a bunch of different cool colors with like more design elements like the perforated toe. Then they've got the legacy model that comes with blind eyelets, which I prefer. Now these are going to come with a gum sole. I've got two pair of these. I wear them literally all the time. They're super comfortable, but they're not all white. That brings us to the brand new Encore model. This is exactly what I've been looking for. I mean, look, it's all white. It's got a clean design with blind eyelets. And in my opinion, that gives the shoe a more expensive and elegant look. I absolutely love these things. Now not only did I get these, but I also got a pair of their premier low tops in this beautiful Carmel suede. I've had my eyes on these for a very long time and I finally got some. They're absolutely beautiful. Something else you should know is these are comfortable right out of the box. Thursday offers the lowest direct to consumer prices on all of their products. And these are all made with premium USA leather. They're also designed and constructed with the highest quality. And because Thursday is direct to consumer, you don't have to pay those ridiculous retail markups. So if you want to go check these out, which I absolutely recommend, just click the link down below in the description and go surf around and just take a few minutes to look at all the different styles and colors that they have. Because look, not only do they have these amazing sneakers, but they've also got boots, leather jackets, and a lot more. The link is in the description. These things are an absolute home run. Thank you, Thursday Boot Company for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. All right, now this is the part of the video where I might get a lot of pushback, especially this one. Now, the next menswear item, in my opinion, that's overrated are luxury watches. Now listen, I totally understand and respect the appeal and the heritage of luxury watches. I think the problem comes in is when certain people say that you need to have certain brands, otherwise, you're just wasting your money. And that's where I call BS. There are hundreds of amazing watches out there from small brands that are just trying to grow their business and make a quality product. And a lot of those brands have quartz movements. And it's a known fact that quartz movements keep more accurate time than automatic movements. But some people seem to be just stuck on the idea that it has to be automatic or nothing. And that's fine, right? You can totally have that opinion. But the fact is, you don't have to spend 10 to 20 grand for a luxury watch brand. So here's an example. I bought this Seiko right here, which has an automatic movement. I got this on Amazon for 300 bucks. No, it's not a Rolex. It's not an Omega. And it's not a Patek Philippe. I've been wearing this watch in a whole bunch of videos recently for the simple fact that it's, it's a nice looking watch from an average brand. It looks cool. It tells time. And that's really all that matters to a whole lot of people. Even if this was a quartz movement, I would still wear it. And I know some of you guys might call me out and say that I have an Omega and I have a Tudor, but both of those are going to be up for sale very soon because I'm trying to fund my side project. But anyway, my point is luxury watch brands, while very cool, in my opinion, are overrated. All right, moving away from actual physical items, here's a couple of men's wear rules that are also overrated. The first one is that black and blue don't go together. That's absolute BS. Check this out. So I've got this really dressy blue velvet tuxedo jacket. I've worn this at a bunch of different events over the last couple of years. And look, it was designed with a black lapel. So if blue and black don't go together, and if that's a fashion sin, this jacket wouldn't exist. The next men's wear rule that's overrated is that everything needs to fit you perfectly. And I know, look, I talk about fit like literally all the time. And I encourage you to take your clothes to a tailor to have them altered to fit you better. But that doesn't mean everything needs to fit perfectly. Now, there are some pieces that you do find that fit you perfectly, but your clothes should fit your body well. That's it. The clothes you wear shouldn't be super loose and baggy, and they shouldn't be super tight and constricting. So when I talk about fit and tailoring, I'm just talking about altering a specific item to fit your body better. If your sleeves are too long, have the sleeves taken up to fit your body. If your pants are too long and maybe too loose, have the pant legs hemmed and tapered to fit your body better. Don't get caught up in chasing perfection because it doesn't exist. And really quick, if you're new here, please consider subscribing. And as always, I welcome your comments down below. Thank you so much for watching. Live well, and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " If you want to get more out of your casual wardrobe and your grown man, this might be the video for you. In the last couple years or so, my wardrobe has changed from very blue collar to then like super dapper and now to what I like to call elevated casual. Where I live right now in Southern California, it's a pretty casual area. So wearing suits and sport coats can be viewed as somewhat overkill. However, that doesn't stop me from dressing up on occasion, but that does bring up a really interesting point about geographics. I mean if you live in a rural part of Iowa or Maine, some of what I'm going to talk about today might seem a little bit too dressed up and maybe not casual enough for where you live and I totally get that. But I guess what I like you to try to do though is to take a look at some of the examples I show and then get a little bit creative with different ways you could apply similar items in a way that works for you and your comfort level. And that brings us to the first item and that's to find your specific uniform. So if you're a rock and roll guy or a biker, you and the people that you hang out with will most likely have a specific uniform. And it's pretty easy to spot, right? I mean if you're a Wall Street or finance guy in a big city and a lot of your friends are in a similar field, chances are you guys also have a specific uniform. And even just by living in certain parts of the country can also dictate that specific uniform. So the question is, is that your uniform? I mean if it is, but you feel like maybe leveling up just a little bit, the first thing to do is to start wearing nicer, better fitting versions of what you already wear. So if it's work boots, jeans and t-shirts, maybe try to find nicer versions of those things and then just start there. Just think about it, you're basically wearing the same stuff you've always worn, you're just now wearing some nicer options. The next way to dress casual as a grown-up man is to stop wearing t-shirts every day everywhere. I know, super controversial. But look, here's the thing. We've become so incredibly casual in the last few years that somehow t-shirts have become like this standard and then even something like a simple polo shirt or any shirt with a collar is now somehow viewed as like super dressy. I'll even go on record right now and say that besides like tank tops, t-shirts are the lowest item on the totem pole when it comes to formality. So what that basically means is they're essentially pajamas. And also for the record, most t-shirts don't look good on the majority of guys, especially if you're carrying some extra weight. Now of course, of course, there are some really nice deluxe t-shirts out there that are made with really nice material, but you just need to understand that t-shirts are not a dressy piece. So then my advice is to go with a nice polo. For example, this one that I'm wearing right now, this is the brand new Maranello Retro Stripe Polo from Collars & Co. This thing fits like absolute perfection. It's lightweight, it's breathable, it's made with this premium cotton and silk blend and it has these cool rib knit cuffs on the sleeves and also the lower hem. So you can wear this thing tucked in or untucked. You can also get this in a buttonless Johnny Collar style, which I'm definitely going to get next. Collars & Co is sponsoring today's video and you probably already know about all the really nice dress collar polo shirts that have these built-in collar stays so the collar always looks great. This collar is a little bit different though, it's a little bit softer. But if you haven't been to their website for a while, they've got some really cool brand new pieces. They've got lightweight quarter zip sweaters. They've got some really good looking knit sweater blazers. They've got outerwear pants and shoes and basically everything you need to expand your own wardrobe from head to toe day to night. There's going to be a link down below in the description to a special offer that's going to get you a discount on anything that you want to go pick up. And I really do encourage you guys to go surf around their website and see all the new stuff they have because I'm sure you'll find something that you need like this polo for example. Hit that link and go check out everything they have and check out this polo because the quality, the fit, the feel is absolutely amazing. Thank you Collars & Co for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. The next way to dress casually as a grown-up man is to limit the use of bold patterns and immature slogans. So I'm okay with subtle pattern but sometimes that really bold colorful pattern can sort of come off a little bit try hard. So I would suggest going with subtle patterns or just stick with solid colors. Now I know that some of you might think that that's boring and I can see your point. I really can. But my response is solid colors just always work and always look good. Busy patterns on the other hand aren't always appropriate for the occasion and can clash very easily. Solids like this shirt just always work all the time for any situation. But again, like I said at the top of this video you can wear whatever you want. But if you came here for my advice and opinion that's what I'm going to give you. Oh and one thing about slogans and graphic t-shirts. Nobody really cares because if you're trying to be ironic or funny with the slogan on your t-shirt like nobody really gets it. I mean you get it and maybe your buddies get it but everybody else just thinks you're kind of weird or even douchey. I'm just saying. Alright now let's talk about shoes for a second and remember we're talking about grown-up men here. This is not appropriate. This is not appropriate. And this is not appropriate. All of these signal that you either haven't grown up yet or that you've just given up on yourself. And that is not what we do as men. We don't give up on ourselves. So as far as casual footwear options go with simple leather sneakers. No athletic shoes. Now white is always going to be a solid choice but if you're maybe concerned about those scuff marks on the side of the sole go with something with a gum sole. You can do brown, blue, black or even something like this in suede. And because it's summertime at least right now another casual choice is going to be a suede loafer. You can wear these with shorts or with chinos. They're lightweight. They're breathable and you can wear them without socks or with no-show socks. But of course if that's not your thing or if it's not warm out and you're wearing pants go with just a regular pair of socks. Now something else here really quick that I want to throw in is the overall fit of the things that you're wearing. If your shirt or your pants are too loose and baggy it doesn't matter how nice that thing is that you're wearing. It just makes you look a little sloppy and it makes you look like you're kind of wearing somebody else's clothes. And if your pants are too long and they sort of stack up and puddle on top of your shoes that's just too long. So take them into a tailor and have them hemmed up to fit you better. Same thing goes with your shirts. If they're really loose and long you either need to start over with a smaller size or see if a tailor can help get that fit dialed in a little bit better. And I know this was a pretty general list but if you want me to drill down and get a little more specific please feel free to let me know down in the comments. And as always my friends thank you very much for watching. Live well and I will see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever time it is for you. Right now it's a late morning for me on Friday, what is it, August 16th? I'm gonna post this video tomorrow, Saturday morning. Anyway, I think I'm gonna post it. I don't know if I'm gonna post this or not because I'm gonna say a lot of things in this video without really saying much and you'll understand in just a second. I will say right up front that I'm nervous but also excited about what's happening. So I will say that I'm on the verge of starting a new business and it's freaking me out because I don't know really all that much about the business side of what I'm doing and I'm learning as I go. I'm learning on the fly and there's just a lot more to it than I had initially anticipated. There's also, we're running into some timing issues so I'm trying to launch, my goal is to launch around the holidays this fall. However, I'm a little behind the eight ball because I should have been doing this about two or three months ago. One of the issues is, how do I say this without saying it, there's some legal stuff that needs to happen that I wasn't familiar with until recently that might take like a month. So there is some approval from the state of California that needs to happen on the thing and that takes about a month, four weeks is what I'm told. So on top of that, there's other things that need to happen in the meantime so that I can hopefully try to launch this thing in November. I don't know. We will see and I'm sorry I really do apologize for being cryptic because I'm not sure if this is even going to happen. There's a huge financial side of this as well that I have not committed to yet. So I'm very, very close but since I haven't committed to it, it's not like a done deal so I don't want to say what the thing is. I hope you can understand that. But I want you to get excited about it because I'm really excited. I'm really excited for it but I'm nervous. I've never done anything like this before. I don't live the entrepreneurial lifestyle besides the YouTube thing and some other side coaching stuff that I've done and wardrobe styling that I've done in the past. I've never started another business so I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I'm learning as I go and it's interesting. It's fun and it's exciting but it's stressful and I'm nervous because like I said there's a bit of a financial aspect to this as well. I need to come up with give or take because I don't know what direction I'm going to go yet but there could be easily $10,000 to $15,000 up front and I don't have that in a shoe box in my house. That's a big chunk of change and it could even be more. I don't have all of the financials you get but that's the idea, the numbers that I have in my head and I hope it's not more than that but if it is we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. So I'm probably selling a few of my watches, my Omega will be for sale, my Tudor will be for sale which is fine. That's not a big deal to me. This is my cheap say go that I got on Amazon for like $300. So and that's fine. Those watches don't have like a life moment significance so I'm okay letting them go. Here's where I want you to sort of start getting excited if you want to. If you want to support me when this whole thing happens. I want to call this kind of on the down low and use Project Dino, D-I-N-O as sort of the underground sort of secret project title. That's what I kind of want to say what it is. So let's use Project Dino as the working title of what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm saying. I hope you guys are still here. If you made it this far like I love you. I want you to hear about it now but I don't want to have a crappy video. Anyway we're rambling again gentlemen so I'm going to drop it off right here. Quick video. Hold on let's do this. Oh there's a wheel spin. Holy shit. That never gets old. Alright on that note guys I'm going to go ahead and let you go. I'm just driving around Wine Country right now. It's just kind of what I do and where I go when I need to clear my head and work through some thoughts. I don't know what it is about being behind the wheel and driving that I accomplish things in my head better than sitting at my computer in my desk or in my office. I hope to tell you guys exactly what's going on very soon. I've got some meetings set up this week early on Monday and we'll see kind of how things go. I'm going to talk to a gentleman tonight. I'm going to a little event tonight where I'm going to talk to a guy and then I have another phone call with another guy on Monday and hopefully buy next week. Today's Friday. Hopefully buy next week at some point I will have something a little more solidified and dialed in. So where we have like an actual commitment. So we'll see. Until then gentlemen live well. I know I'm trying. Have a good one. We'll talk to you soon."

        "transcript": " What's going on you guys welcome to the video we're doing something different today We're gonna have a pretty good time and you're coming with me. We're gonna take a ride And then I actually get moving. I'm a little bit late So we're gonna go to the gym and I won't take no for an answer. You're coming with me We're gonna do a workout together and your guys are gonna meet Logan my trainer He's a he's pretty good at what he does and oh my god It's a hundred degrees outside. It is roasty So we're gonna go to the gym and we're gonna talk to Logan and he's gonna walk us through a full body workout Basically what he does for me during my twice a week workouts He's gonna explain more about what he does, but I mean we're trying to you know Prevent injury like if I get hurt I'm down for like a month. I can't have that so we're trying to get strong. We're trying to get fit We're trying to get healthy. We're trying to look good with our clothes off all the cool things But anyway really quick. Have you guys do follow the Instagram? Do you follow the Instagram because if you do? Have you seen the new bronze wheels? They're not new bronze wheels. They're the same wheels I had there were gloss black and I just had them powder coated this bronze color. I Don't know I'm dropping in some car content here for you guys. There were so hard to keep clean gloss black the cars matte and Anyway, I went with this bronze color. I think it looks pretty sick Anyway enough about that Let's get moving you guys Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Good to see you Going good right on nice shirt. Thank you. You like the quality. I do like that fit. Yeah, what is it? Um, it's actually cuts Dude, I'm wearing cuts. Oh, no way way totally dude. Good thing today's video is sponsored by cuts. Let's get in a little bit later All right, you guys so this is Logan my trainer. I've been hanging out with this guy for what about seven months now since since I think it might be eight months eight months. Yeah since January. Yeah. Yeah So that's when I started down here I see Logan twice a week and we do full body workouts And we're gonna get into kind of what I do and what basically a typical workout is what we're gonna sort of go through Today, but Logan tell me a little bit about yourself and what you're all about and what you do. Yeah um So I've been a trainer for the past four years and uh, I'm really just inspired to help people Start their healthy lifestyle and just that's what I really like to put a big emphasis on when it comes to weight training is Hey, let's make this a part of your lifestyle. Let's make sure that it's not about getting in super good shape Absolutely, you can do that with weight training, but it's all about mainly that mental health aspect Making you do something that makes you feel good And then when you hit a workout, then that's gonna make you eat a little bit healthier throughout the day It's all about balance at the end of the day and that's what we talk about with john It's just snowball too Like once you start looking better and feeling better you want to do things to make that happen faster and do better things At then the day like as a man I feel like I need a couple hours a week to just be able to be focusing on myself So then I can show up for others and that's really what this is all about is Just taking care of yourself and then making you you feel a little bit better So and this is why I like to do the full body weight training because it's good on the time efficiency So you're able to get in and out of here within an hour But most importantly it creates a satisfying soreness Where you're not super sore the next couple days because if you hit a full one hour leg workout You are going to be super sore for the next two days where you can't walk up the stairs pretty much or you can't sit down in the Toilet so that's why we do full body weight training because we do one to two movements per muscle group And it just creates a satisfying soreness the next day So we're going to walk through a typical full body workout for me today. Yeah, okay And normally we start with a five minute cardio warm-up just to get that heart rate up and make sure that the body temperature is raised And that you're aware that you're working out and then we go into like about a 10 minute core warm-up It's all about just activating the core. You don't need to spend an hour doing core So exactly well I get john starting on some cardio then we'll go into a little core Warm-up and then go into the weight training. Let's go. Let's go Okay, so for the sake of the video We talked about it and I think that we're going to do kind of a beginner to moderate beginner Workout and movements We're going to do some machine work and some dumbbell work and I think I was kind of thinking about how to do this and structure the the workouts And I thought that if you're new and just in like going to the gym yourself These are some kind of easy basic movements. Just basic movements. Yeah. Yeah. So let's do that We're starting with what leg press. Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and get started with legs And that's john's favorite. No, I hate legs, but we're doing it. Let's get into it. Okay, you guys before we jump into leg press I do want to take just a minute and let you know about cups clothing because These guys are having a massive sale and it's going on right now and you can save 30 off site-wide I'm just a huge fan of everything these guys are doing and I would say That some of my favorite pieces are of course the t-shirts. I wear those to the gym all the time This brand new polo shirt that fits absolutely perfectly I got the shorts on if you guys can see the shorts. These are stretchy. They're super lightweight. They feel amazing I also love that long sleeve zip up and of course the joggers And they've got a lot of other pieces like sweatshirts outerwear, of course shorts pants and joggers basically Everything you need for a good-looking casual wardrobe and they make everything with all the right proportions So I believe they look better on a much wider range of guys Their pieces are super high quality and made with this cotton poly and spandex blend that you can still Machine wash and dry and everything comes pre-shrunk. So I think generally they'll do like 20 off But like I said right now, there's a huge site-wide sale going on where you can save 30 off anything that you want to go Grab for yourself. So don't miss out on this deal The direct link is in the description and thank you cups clothing for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video Let's get back to the workout and let's go ahead and get started on to the leg press I'm going to have you go ahead and get seated in there. Um, just remember you don't want to be slouched down into the machine You want to make sure that you're standing up proud Making sure that your head is all the way back because we want that spine flat Then your feet placement is going to be a little bit higher up on the platform Uh, then most importantly when you extend up, I don't want you to lock out your knees because then that can invert your knees So we want to keep a slight bend in your knees throughout the movement So and then also you already got your feet placement covered You want your toes slightly pointed out higher up on the platform. Great. So I'm gonna have you go ahead and press up You're gonna release these two safety clamps right here So knees going out towards your shoulders and we're gonna do 15 reps for this one. Okay. All right sounds good There you go extend down perfect Good form three two One there you go So the leg press is really good at targeting all parts of that leg muscle But John how are you feeling after this one? Feel good. Yeah, you like it. Yeah. All right. You ready to do three more sets Uh, I think we need to add some more weight. What do you think? Yeah, let's do it. Let's add some more plates Make sure you keep that core tight there you go two One there you go. Good job So this would be a really good machine to do four sets of 15 if you only have access to this machine Or simply you can just do three sets of 15 and then pair it with another movement I like to keep the rep range for uh accessory and machine movements in that 10 to 15 range And then for compound movements, I like to keep it in that six to 12 range So let's go ahead and get it started on to chest for our upper body So john we're gonna go ahead and go into flat dumbbell presses. Okay So I'm gonna have you go ahead and grab a lighter weight. Maybe like 20s or 25s And then we're gonna go into a four sets of 12. Okay. I'll go ahead and give you your instructions as well I'm gonna grab 30s though. I guess we can stroke our ego for the camera. It is what it is brother Go ahead and lay flat on your back. There you go. Okay. Remember our elbows want to be tilted in right there Right about that halfway position and then our forearms also want to be tilted in you don't want to be out wide while you're pressing Right now you're gonna go ahead and press up top the corners of the dumbbells right above your chin There you go. Now you're gonna go bring it back down off to the side of your chest Now press back up How many of these we're gonna do 12 reps of this one. Okay There you go Perfect So normally we would either do just four sets straight through and just really prioritize just bumping up the weight and just maxing out your weight Yep, but today we're just gonna kind of keep it quicker. So let's go ahead and superset it with some chest flies Over at the cable pulleys. I really like the cable pulleys because they're really great for injury prevention So that's a main priority priority with john recovering from his shoulder injuries. So let's go ahead and get into that Yeah, so if they don't know I my my left shoulder is a little jacked up and we were doing A dumbbell flies and it just it messes with my shoulder We switched to cable flies And I feel way more comfortable and I feel I feel the burn a lot more Oh, yeah, then I ever did with dumbbells. So I think that's a really good movement in case people don't want to get injured like I did It's all about injury prevention. Exactly. Let's go. Let's go So one main priority is that we want to make sure that this cable pulleys right at shoulder width So i'm a little bit taller. So it's gonna be higher up for me But john let's have you stand right next to it right about there is probably a good height right there Then we're gonna do the same thing for the other one. We want to make sure that they're even So then from here, we're gonna grab one handle at a time Grab both of them taking two steps out Bring those cable attachments out like this You want to be slightly leaning forward as well. And then you want to be extending out kind of like you're doing a Hugging motion. So right here. This is the beginning part. Then you're bringing it out squeezing the chest at the top And now if you want to get a little bit more advanced, I kind of like to tilt the handles in kind of Tackle together. Get that real good squeeze. So john go ahead and get into that We're gonna do three sets of 15 for this one. Okay. Okay, so then we're gonna superset it with the dumbbell presses Got it right there. Perfect That Form okay that form looks great Perfect. The coolest is that you can really feel that connection to that muscle And sometimes it's kind of hard to get that with that freeway So that's why it's always good to kind of have a combination of machines cables and then dumbbells. Yeah, I feel that Yeah, I love that. That's a nice burn. Yeah Yeah, way better than uh than dumbbell flies. Oh, yeah Yeah, dumbbell flies are a little bit rough on the shoulder. Yeah for sure. That's that's a good one. I love that one All right So normally what we would do like logan mentioned is we'd superset these two exercises So I would be over on bench again flat bench doing dumbbell press and then I'd come back over here and do cables So we do like three sets of those. Yeah, and then we'd move on but I think for the sake of the video We're just gonna move on. I don't want to get like you guys bored. So what let's go ahead and dive into some triceps Triceps. Oh my god. Let's do it and we'll actually stay right here on the cable pole. So let's dive into it. Okay So I'm gonna go ahead and bring this to the top pulley or the top of the pole I'm gonna go ahead and grab a rope attachment So we're gonna do another tricep superset and again, we're just gonna do three sets for this one So we'll start with just single arm cable tricep extensions. All right elbows are gonna be off to the side john Okay forearm right at that 90 degree angle mark hand across that rail And then you're gonna extend down off to the side of your hip Bring it back up to that 90 degree angle mark and then extend back down We're gonna do 12 reps on each side. All right sounds good There you go 12 reps on each arm So your triceps two-thirds of your arm so your tricep is really important to grow because that's what's gonna ultimately add that muscle mass To the arm and create that size. So exactly very important to Prioritize your triceps and then to this training All right, so then we're going to go into cable rope attachments So I like to have my hands at the bottom of this attachment Push those elbows back keep them off to the side Then bring my forearms up to that 90 degree angle mark and then I'm gonna extend down off to the side of the legs And sometimes if someone has a back injury, I'll do one foot in front of the other to kind of take off that pressure from that lower back So I'll extend down right here So let's do one. There you go Really good good form I like to superset with the cable Single arm and then going to these we've even done some like overhead stuff. Oh, yeah I know that's one of your favorites. Yeah the cable overhead. Yeah, love that one. Yesterday. We were here We did a workout yesterday and we did triceps and I was like you probably felt that a little bit And I smoked you yesterday with our workout. Oh, yeah. It was a good one. Yeah, good good workout yesterday And so that's what's important with the training is that really base it off of how you're feeling So when john comes in and he's a little bit more tired or a little bit more stressed from work We don't really absolutely kill him We listen to his body and kind of slow down the training But then when he comes in and he's ready to go and I can tell he's amped up. Yeah Yeah, we're gonna smoke him. So we do a lot of supersets high intensity. Make sure that was yesterday. That's really good So yeah yesterday he had a really hard workout. So one thing that I do want to mention is What I like about Logan is he's not like militant Right. It's like I'm too old for that shit. Like if you're gonna just yell at me one more Like I'm not that guy like so like yeah, he pushes me but he's not he's not in my face I've been the dad. I understand that man is it takes it. It's hard to listen to another man So I like to have that balance where I'm just not overstepping but more just like hey, this is what I would do or Hey, let's do this. It's a lot of like this is what I would do or let's do this It's very in a friendly approach. I wouldn't I wouldn't have continued if he was too militant So I tried screaming at him one time and he fired me. So then we had a kind of we had this learning lesson. Exactly All right, what's next? All right, let's go into back. All right, cool. All right So john, we're gonna do wide grip lat pull downs for this one It's I really put a big effinces on putting your hands at the curve of the bar Yep, just like really get that squeeze in that lat muscle But most importantly we want to make sure that our thumbs are over the bar Just so then it doesn't put a big effinces on the forearms and it really just targets that lat muscle When you're doing pull downs, you really want to imagine that your hands are hooks and that you're just pulling it down And you're not really gripping the bar if you're gripping the bar a lot Then you're gonna feel it a lot in your forearm. So we'll go into this one We're gonna get directly underneath that cable pulling then we're gonna slightly lean back right here And then we're gonna bring it down to our chin We want to hold it down at your chin for about half a second and I want to stay slightly leaning back I don't want to be rotating up at the top of the movement There we go. So lean slightly back bring it down to your chin. There we go Good now, let's do 12 reps for this one. Okay, cool. Okay one more there we go Okay, so let's go ahead and do some curls over at the rock. Okay curls for the girls. So let's go curls for the girls Is that what he said? I didn't say he said it Since we want to make sure our ego is all good. We're gonna grab the 20s right here We're gonna start with our dumbbells off to the side. Then we're gonna curl up right into our between our chest and our shoulder Okay, it's important that we have our elbows off to the side for all our arm exercises Sorry, I just need to get a pump real quick. I see that I see that. All right, so it's your workout today. Is that right? Yeah, I guess so Okay, well, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with 25. Oh, okay, buddy. Let me grab the 30s All right, there we go Good So to finish up the workout, we're gonna dive into some shoulders. Okay, my favorite muscle, but all right All right, so we're gonna go into some lateral raises and front raises We're gonna do 10 reps for each one So for our lateral raises that you want to have your elbow your dumbbells kind of tilted inwards at the bottom You're gonna roll those shoulders back chest up again. Then we're gonna extend out lateral right here And you don't really you want to make sure that your elbows are above the dumbbells throughout the whole movement And then you also don't want to be extending over your Traps I would say okay, so I'm just keeping it parallel. I'm not really I'm not going all the way up here I'm just keeping it right here one cool Two so we're gonna do 10 reps. Oh man, my shoulders are already burning Then we're gonna do one foot in front of the other just because if we do front raises like this Then it ends up being a lot swinging and then that hurts the spine So okay, we want to make sure that we're one foot in front of the other leaning slightly forward Dumbbells starting off to the side Then we're gonna bring it up to our chin and kind of rotate at the top cap the dumbbells together at your chin Okay, so I roll those shoulders back chest up hit my hands right here. Okay There you go good And we're gonna do 10 reps Good now remember one foot in front of the other you already did that feeling perfect dumbbells off to the side tapping together That was good how did that feel I feel that yeah feels good Did hurt that shoulder or anything? No, it's good on the shoulder. Okay good. You felt it in the muscle. Oh, definitely For sure. Awesome. So are you ready for our mile run outside a mile run? Yes. Let's make it too. Yeah It's only 100 degrees. I know it's 103 It's 103. Okay. Wow. That's what my car said on the way when we're targeting a certain muscle like so let's say we're doing back And we're doing what just one movement John's gonna do four sets But if we're doing two movements, then we're gonna do three sets. So again with the full body weight training It's all about just going in the gym and doing one to two movements per muscle group and just getting in and out Weight training workouts should only really be 30 to 45 minutes if you're not on your phone scrolling So John can't do that because I'm his trainer and I have to it's kind of awkward if he if he pulls out his phone No, I put it in the locker now. Yeah, I know better not to yell at him though. So really quick though Um, we didn't do abs to start this. Yeah workout today. Should we finish with abs? Yeah, let's go ahead and dive into it. Yeah, let's do let's do some abs really quick and show you guys kind of what What we do kind of on and off on different days. Let's do it. All right. What are we not doing because I think it's boring We're not doing a plank. We already had this argument before we started shooting this I threw out a plank and John said no, we're not doing a playing. It's boring to watch. You guys don't want to watch me They're doing a plank. So we're gonna do we're gonna do some cross table crossovers Okay, and we're targeting the bleak with this movement I always like to start them the workout with crossovers because it kind of gets a good full body stretch You're kind of working out the hips a little bit your back. So we're with this movement We're gonna take two steps out right here Then we're gonna extend out our arms right here go down and then we're gonna extend out one. So we're gonna cross over And I'm really just trying to keep my body facing forward the entire time With just a slight rotation at the beginning part and at the end part. So right here cool And again, this movement's really good at targeting the largest part of the muscle abdominal area Which is going to be that oblique muscle. So this is an essential movement for really building a nice core area Yeah, yeah, get that v-shape. Yeah, I've learned to like focus on my abs. It's like pretty much tighten my abs the entire time Yeah, but ultimately just tightening your core. Yeah, because you want to make sure that your core is tight And that's why I always like to kind of start with core. Yeah So just like a slight bend with that opposite arm And you're really driving through with this arm there we go It's also really good for your golf swing. Yeah, right. I got to work on that. Yeah Don't you live on like a golf course or something? I live two blocks off a golf course and I don't play. Yeah, exactly It's pretty sad. Thank you very much for reminding me. Well, you used to play. So this is just a reminder That's another reason why john really has a trainer john knows how to exercise now He knows a lot about nutrition and he is fairly healthy, but it's kind of just on his journey It's about accountability Realistically pretty much holding someone like and it makes it fun for john like he gets to come talk to me Yeah, we catch up and then I just get to hold john accountable and really just check in on how he's doing with his nutrition You know, I mean that's a lot of it. Honestly, it's accountability and that's why You know, I've told a lot of people when I talk about fitness and stuff on the channel Not that I'm like a fitness expert by any means, but It's like it's accountability. Yeah, and like do you trust yourself to go to the gym? You know three times a week. Yeah, and I I know myself. I'm not gonna drive to the gym I'm just not gonna go and also like another big part of like and you don't have to go and hire a trainer Simply get started with your a friend and just like when you're getting started with a friend Just make sure that you guys both are like signing an agreement or just doing a verbal agreement That's saying like hey, let's make sure that we hold each other accountable But most importantly just be there as a friend to like because we all have that good voice and that negative voice in our head It's and like you just need someone to support you along the way to remind you that you're doing good And that you just need to continue to push forward and just continue to stay consistent and not to give up Oh, that's right. We're doing leg raises. You're dynamic fun movement. Come on. Let's go. Oh, shit I thought we were done. No, we're not done, buddy. All right, John once you get up on this platform Just remember I don't want your legs going behind you You always want to keep your legs in front of you your feet in front of you Just because if you're swinging back behind you that's gonna start causing some lower back pain Again, it's all about injury prevention. Cool. So go ahead and rest your elbows right up there Kind of push away to kind of brace that core a little bit better Then bring those legs out in front of you. Don't let them go behind you There we go. Keep them out in front of you. There you go 15 right there Really good job This is hands down John's favorite movement right here. Yeah There's that grunting I think I can see my ugly face today That's like unless are you on a pool party tomorrow? Then we should probably do it Probably just do some more. Yeah, you could get those abs popping the next day Yeah, so this is generally like I said how we would start to work out but we're ending with it today and it's uh That's good. Yeah, it was a good workout. Yeah, thank you You break a sweat a little bit right there a little bit a little bit. We didn't go through like the entire Workout we sort of you know made it a little bit shorter just for the sake of time, but dude Thank you. I appreciate you. Yeah, I appreciate you. Thanks for doing this Yeah, it was fun. I'll leave his info down below if you're in the Temecula Murrieta area and you want to hang out with Logan And oh, yeah, have him smack you around a little bit male or female Um, yeah, it's it's a good time. He's been He's been good. It's been Yeah, I can't say enough about him. So anyway, that's enough. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, nice shirt by the way I know I'm gonna yeah continue to wear it for the rest of the day. So I love my cuts. I'll see you guys in the next video. Thanks for watching"

        "transcript": " Alright you guys we're finally doing it today. We're finally getting to the outfit critique video I know I promised it to you about two weeks ago I do apologize lots lots of stuff sort of happening over here on my end and by the way this little picture thing It might be changing as we go throughout the video. It's just a random series of contemporary modern art I think it's kind of cool. It's a YouTube channel Anyway enough of that This video When I do call outs for you guys to send me pictures of yourself in Whatever outfit the theme is going to be for that round of videos this time It's a summer basically your go-to summer outfit I will send a call out on Instagram and one of my Instagram stories and say hey We're doing the video DM me a picture of yourself head to toe Wearing your go-to summer outfit or your go-to winter fall spring whatever the the season is we're doing summer I'm a little scattered. I've got lots going on here and I was doing a lot before I sat down to film this We're doing it. Thank you to everyone. Let me get back on track here. Thank you to every single one of you who sent in pictures I couldn't get to every single person Otherwise the video would just be super long and I tend to ramble like I'm doing right now. So Let's just get right to it. What do you say and also just so we're all clear here when I do these kinds of videos specifically this kind where I'm critiquing outfits I'm just critiquing the clothes right I'm critiquing things like fit and Style choices and color choices and those types of things I'm not critiquing the individual because all these guys are brave To be able to send in their pictures so I can do this and I appreciate it very much. So with that let's move on All right, we're starting off with our friend Corey. So Corey sent me two pictures I want to I want to check out both of them the first one black Shoes white trousers black polo shirt. I think the overall outfit works Really well. I just think that there's a fit issue with the shirt Corey I think the shirt's a little bit too big for you and and the reason I say that let me sort of squeeze in on this picture And I'll try to put it on screen here It's there's a lot of gathering around the waist on the sides and the shoulder seam So let me I don't know if this is going to translate on video But the shoulder seam right here where this where the basically the body the yoke of the shirt meets the sleeve That is down here off your shoulder. It needs to be on top of the shoulder and yours is down here off the shoulder It just gives it a look that it's too big but otherwise I like I Like the big contrast that you've got going on Otherwise, I think it's a pretty solid outfit just a shirt looks a little bit big and Speaking of that. I want to get to the next picture for this next one. I love everything about the outfit I love the white sneakers. I like the white shorts. I like that blue and white pattern shirt that you have on My only thing I got two things that I'm just going to point out and they're just sort of things that are my opinion I think that the shorts are a little bit too long for you and perhaps even a little bit too wide I would maybe go an inch shorter on the shorts just to get it like at the knee or above the knee slightly They appear to be like below your kneecap and that just gives it kind of a just an outdated look This shirt I like this shirt. I got no problems with the shirt, but I think that the cut of the shirt is more It's cut full and you're like you're a slender guy What I what I'm seeing is First and foremost the sleeve. It's a really big wide sleeve opening and you've got regular average size arms You can't feel that whole sleeve out So it looks like the shirts like a lot bigger on you and also it might be It might be a little bit big because again the shoulder seam is down off your I'm sorry The sleeve seam is off the shoulder and I like to see it on top of the shoulder Maybe look for some slim fit shirts because you're a slim fit guy I would say this seems to be like a fuller boxier cut shirt instead of something that's more like tailored and Trim fit or slim fit not that it needs to be super tight on you But you're a slim guy and it just appears anyway in the photo that you're wearing stuff That's a little bit bigger cut for you. Okay, next we have Alex. So Alex sent me a whole bunch of photos I'm only gonna use a few of them starting with this one where I think he looks fantastic Everything works the white sneakers are working the Navy shorts are working They're right above the knee right where I think they should be anyway The shirt is working We're picking up some Navy with the shorts in in the pattern of the shirt The pink is cool. It's just giving me like a vacation vibe and I like it I won't dock too many points for the Apple watch, but whatever. I'm just just kidding. Let's see the next one Okay, I had to put this one in here because I think it's great like it's a go-to summer outfit So that was like a really casual outfit and this is more of a dressy outfit So we starting starting at the feet great looking pair of medium brown shoes the dress pants are looking great I looks like we've got like a windowpane pattern going on here the pink shirt. I think it's a Navy jacket I can't tell if it's Navy or black. I'm assuming it's Navy We've got the pink pattern pocket square to go with the shirt the shirts tucked in you look like a million bucks dude Well done. All right last one. So Alex is liking his pattern. I got no problems with that I think I like the pattern on this shirt actually really really well I like that a lot the white sneakers the white shorts to hit you right above the knee. They're not super baggy on you They're not really wide the shirt fits your body really well. It's not too long It doesn't need to be tucked in you can wear it out just like that Everything about everything about it is working. You're picking up the white in the shirt with the shorts and the shoes Overall well done, dude. Thank you so much next we have Jean So I'm gonna show two pictures of Jean this first one dialed in love everything about it We've got the white sneakers that look fantastic. We've got some burgundy chinos on we've got the brown belt I'm cool with that good looking watch by the way I don't know what that is But the strap is really cool and the shirt fits you really good here It's I don't know if you can see it on the screen, but it's a really subtle like powder blue pattern with some little white dots on it I think But overall really well done the next photo though not so sure Jean what happened All right starting with what I do like and then we'll get into what I think Jean can do a little bit better Starting with the shoes love the suede loafers. I've got two pair similar to this I wear them all the time the shorts fit you really good. They hit you right above the knee. I think that's perfect Jean the shirt is a little bit big on you now. Let me get into it a little bit. I know that it's a summer shirt It's a camp collar shirt It's it's sort of that summer oversized sort of loose fitting vibe. I got no problem with that what? What what happens is it looks like you're wearing? Someone else's shirt or it looks like it's a size too big Here's what I mean Like I talked about on Corey look at your shoulder where your natural shoulder is and look where the seam is Where the shirt attaches to the arm or the sleeve? It's just way down off your shoulder the sleeves are really long That's his style choice But I think the sleeves are kind of long for you and they're a little bit wide for you You're a slender guy. You don't need to be wearing a shirt. That's that baggy in my opinion I think if that shirt was a size down or maybe just a different style of shirt That's not so loose and oversized you look like a million bucks. Otherwise. I mean it's still a good overall choice Everything works well together Colors and all that stuff work really good together We're going kind of neutral which I do like it's just the size of the shirt I think could be a little bit better. Thank you so much for sending in your pictures. All right now We've got Greg so Greg is a regular in all my critique videos dude. Thank you very much But you're showing off at this point to look at look at this guy Incredible I mean what can I say here that the white sneakers are awesome the dark denim. No distressing is awesome The salmon color polo fits you really good. I mean what what can I say? I've got nothing I've got nothing to say there looks fantastic in this other one now You're just posing you're posing you're just a big show off at this point Love the white sneakers We've got Is that a gray or blue? I'm pretty sure it's blue. I don't know if it's just a white balance But I think it's a blue pair of chinos. We got a black belt. We've got another blue polo. We've got the cool bag We've got the cool watch. We've got the cool sunglasses Yeah, well done dude. Well done. Thank you so much next. We have our friend Jeff So Jeff I gotta ask you a question because when I first looked at these pictures I'm thinking that these are like AI background now. I'm not sure because there's one in here that actually looks like you were there I mean they all look like you were there. I need you to comment and let me know where this was Because they look really cool the backgrounds are very very nice. Okay, you look like a million bucks my friend Look at we've got the tan boat shoes Tan shorts fit you good brown belt. I don't know if this is a white shirt That's picking up all the green of the palm trees or if it's like a green coral Kind of a color the sunglasses look great. The hat looks great Let's move on to the next one because this one looks really good. All right. We've got our friend the palm tree again You're looking dialed in those loafers Those are looking fantastic ox blood. I'm thinking those are ox blood White trousers the belt to match the shoes the casual blue shirt. We've got the hat again I mean everything fits you really good everything just fits and this is This is what Jeff does really well besides like matching up everything Jeff is just nailed to fit well done. Okay last one and this is the picture that looks like you're actually out somewhere So you're at it. You're at a bar somewhere, but but the floor doesn't look quite right. I'm so confused on these pictures I don't know why but did you need to you need to let me know where this was?

We've got a powder blue light blue pair of shorts on the belt matches the shoes and We've got a really cool looking pattern shirt that's screaming tropical vacation vibes To me anyway, it's it's a it's a bold choice I think you can pull it off. It might be a little bit much for me But I have no issues with it at all. I think it looks good and bonus points for tucking the shirt in I got no problems with tucking shirts like that into pair of shorts I know people were afraid to tuck shirts into shorts. I'm telling you it works. It works. Look it works I'm not sure what's going on here, but I think you guys are all just a bunch of big show offs because you're all doing a really good job All right, we have our friend Larry so Larry well done You've got a really high contrast outfit going on here, but it works really well You've got the shoes that matches the shirt you're doing the sandwich method very very nice You've got the white sorts that fit you great They're right above the knee just right above the knee and I think that's really good length You sent me two more pictures. Let's look at those Larry I don't know what you're trying to do here But I think you might be trying to take my title away from me as most interesting man in the world man That's mine. All right, really well done You've got the brown suede loafers No socks or maybe some no-show socks. I just think it's such a cool casual breathable summertime look We've got the white pants and we've got two different shades of blue on our upper half And I think we've got a really subtle pattern in that sports jacket looks really really good The bonus and the cherry on top for me is the pocket square I'll try to squeeze in on this for you guys or zoom in on it and give you guys a close-up But it's a yellow and blue pattern pocket square yellow and blue are opposite on the color wheel So they always look good together and Larry just threw that in there Like as a pro move And it just works really well.

I mean how pro move is that well done? I think it looks really cool I think a pair of loafers like tan like a like a cream or like a tan loafer would look really well with this also Pink shorts white shirt the wash is looking cool I probably do a gray belt instead of a black belt the black belt just kind of cuts you right down the middle Either way, it's not a bad move or maybe like a yeah if you were doing a Pair of loafers like Tanner Brown loafers with a brown belt that'd be just Completely dialed in but this next one totally takes the cake for me. I mean calm on dude Let's go with the Ascot. Is that a seersucker jacket? Ascot seersucker jacket white button down maybe chinos Those might even be blue shoes if I know Oz either blue shoes They might be black, but they look they kind of a blue tint to it.

Pay attention to the fit if things are a little bit loose and long or baggy either don't buy it Or if you do buy it take it to a tailor I mean 25 to 35 bucks at a tailor will probably Take care of most all of your sort of simple nip and tuck adjustments All you guys look fantastic and you all did a really good job So I want to thank each and every one of you and everyone else who sent in pictures It's that takes a lot to send in pictures so I can do this and I appreciate that very very much you guys Thanks again live well, and I'll see you all in the next video"

        "transcript": " Today, gentlemen, I want to go over some really cool style tricks that a lot of guys just don't even know about. Now, some of these tricks might seem sort of obvious, but then some other ones, you might scratch your head and go like, that actually makes a lot of sense. So, as we get moving and go along, if you pick up something new, please hit the like button to help YouTube show this video to more guys that might need to see it. Okay, we're starting with removing those ugly white deodorant marks that you get on the sides of your shirt. Now, generally, you should put your deodorant on after you put your shirt on, but I know things happen and now you need to change your shirt. Now, as much as you try to avoid it, you still end up with those crazy deodorant marks. So, here's what you do. Grab a used up dryer sheet and then just start erasing those deodorant marks. I don't know why and I don't know how this works as well as it does, but it instantly removes all of those marks. But just make sure you use an old dryer sheet, not a new one. Okay, next we have avoiding those ugly shoulder bumps that you get from your shirts by using better quality hangers. If you're still using those skinny plastic hangers or worse yet, those tiny metal ones, those things are terrible because just within like a day or so, they stretch out the fabric in that one little spot in your shoulders which leaves those weird looking bumps. Get yourself some wood hangers like these. So, these have several benefits. First, I mean they look awesome in your closet. Second, they're a lot longer so they extend it down past the yoke and further down your shoulder. And thirdly, these are a lot thicker so they put less pressure in one small point that causes those bumps. Now, something else you can do if you've got some like knit polos or some thinner fabric summertime shirts is get yourself some of these thicker coat hangers. Now, these are generally meant for your like thicker heavier coats and sports jackets, but they also work really well for your thinner shirts and some of your knit shirts. Because look, as you can see, these cover a much bigger area of the shoulder and they won't cause those shoulder bumps. The next clothing trick is to use some double-sided fabric tape. Now, this stuff comes in really handy for several different reasons. One of the main reasons though is to help with your placets on your button-up shirts. So, you probably have some shirts that always seem to gap in between the buttons, whether it's in your chest area or maybe down towards your belt line. Use a little bit of this double-sided fabric tape in between those buttons and that problem just goes away. Now, you can also use it to keep your pocket square up and in place and to keep your collar points down. And on the subject of collars, my next style trick is to use one of these. Now, this little guy is from Slit Collar and they were nice enough to sponsor today's video. This is a flexible piece of thin plastic with these silicone pads out towards the end. So, basically, you pop your collar up, you put this around the back of your neck and then flip your collar back down. And because of this design, it helps keep your collar looking good, but more importantly, it helps your placets stand up and be a lot straighter. And that's one of the main downsides of dress shirts if you have some of these top buttons undone because the upper placet area doesn't have any support and it always looks kind of weird and floppy. The Slit Collar fixes that problem without having to cut open your shirts or modify anything. You buy this guy once and then you swap it over from shirt to shirt. It's simple and after like 10 seconds, you totally forget you even have it on because it's that comfortable. Now, they've got these new bundle kits with three different sizes. You've got the regular size, which is pretty much perfect for most shirt collars. They've got the slim size, which is good for polo shirts and thinner collar shirts. Then you have the athletic size for larger neck sizes and larger shirt collars. And they're all fully adjustable to fit any neck size and the silicone pads keep this thing in place so it doesn't slide around. I've done a few promotions for these guys before and a lot of you guys give me feedback that you absolutely love these things. So there's going to be a special link down below in the description, along with the discount code that's going to get you a great deal. So go get yours today. Thank you Slit Collar for supporting my channel and for sponsoring today's video. Alright, I want to jump back over to hangers for a second and talk about the reverse hanger trick. So here's the deal. Go to your closet and then flip around your hangers the opposite way. So then when you wear something and then wash it and then hang it back up, hang it back up the regular way. So after a few months, take a look at the things that are still reversed because if you haven't worn that thing in like two or three months and it's in season, chances are you just don't like it for whatever reason and you should probably consider getting rid of it, donating it, or just getting it out of your closet. Now let's talk about a really big pain point for a lot of us and that's getting rid of wrinkles quickly and easily. Now of course, you can bust out the iron or the steamer, but sometimes you just don't want to go through that hassle. Here's what I do. I've got one of these super fine mist spray bottles that I got on Amazon. So what I'll do is just spray a little bit of water on the shirt just to give it a little bit of moisture without getting it totally wet. And then throw that in the dryer. Now depending on the shirt, I might grab like a bath towel and throw it in there as well just to give it something else to kind of flop around with. Now I've also heard that you can throw in an ice cube in the dryer and that's another way to do it. But honestly, I've really never tried it that way, but everyone seems to say that that way works. Now you could also just spray some water on the shirt with it still hanging up on the hanger and then grab a blow dryer and then blow the wrinkles out that way. Now here's another really good idea. So say you've got some dress shoes that you really like, but they're just not quite as comfortable as you wish they were. Grab the insoles out of your athletic sneakers and then put those inside of your dress shoes. Now most insoles in running shoes are of course removable and it makes a world of difference inside your dress shoes. You can basically go from like a three in terms of comfort to a nine. Okay, now I want to move on to a few tricks you can use when you're putting your outfits together for the day. First things first. If you're wearing a suit jacket or a sports jacket, please, you've got to make sure to cut and remove that little tack stitching off the jacket vents in the back. That little thin stitch is only there to prevent damage during packing and shipping. That thread is supposed to be removed so those vents can open up freely like they're supposed to. Now this next one is kind of a big deal because it's summertime right now, but if you're wearing white pants, wear skin colored underwear. Now I know the obvious choice would seem to wear white underwear, but white underwear shows through white clothing big time. So if you're a darker skinned guy, you're kind of in luck because you can get away with wearing something darker. But if you're a lighter skinned guy, try to find if you can like nude color underwear or if you can't wear something in a light gray. Again, don't wear white underwear under white pants. Another clothing trick is to stick with solid colors in neutral earth tones. Earth tones always look good together and always go together so you don't have to worry too much about clashing your colors. Because the thing is, patterns can get to be a little busy and bold sometimes, but solid colors always look good. They make you look more sophisticated and dare I say, more expensive and higher class. They just always work. So now this brings up a few different ways that you can wear your solid colors. Try both of these ideas and see what you think. Now first is to wear contrasting outfits. If you have a little extra weight around the middle, wear darker solids at the top and then lighter color pants. That contrast is going to visually slim you down because dark colors are slimming because they subtract light and light colors are bulking because they reflect light adding some size. Now the second idea is to wear monochrome outfits. So this is basically wearing the same general color but in different shades. So if you're wearing dark blue jeans, try like a medium blue to light blue shirt. Maybe you're wearing say gray slacks go with a dark gray or maybe a black sweater. You get the idea. The next trick is to use the sandwich method. I've talked about this a few times recently, but it's basically wearing a similar color shirt to your shoes. So maybe you've got a brown jacket on with blue jeans. Go with a brown pair of boots or shoes. If you're wearing a white shirt, go with white sneakers. Now this isn't like a necessary thing or any type of a solid rule, but it's just one trick that you can use to add a lot more balance and interest to what you're wearing. Once again, gentlemen, if you enjoyed this one, please hit that like button and consider subscribing if you're not already. And as always, my friends, thank you so much for watching. Live well and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " I recently published a video about things people waste money on. I sparked a lot of great conversation, including this one comment, idea for a sequel video would be things worth spending money on. I love that idea. So in this video, we're talking about how to use money to actually enhance your life in meaningful ways. So when you're an old man on your deathbed, you look back and think, I spent my money wisely. No regrets. By the way, this video is sponsored by Stitch Fix, where I got this lovely sweater. I'll talk more about them in a bit. For now, let's get right into the list. Number one, buy your time back. Money's greatest intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time. That quote is from The Psychology of Money, which is probably the best personal finance book that I've ever read. See time, unlike money, is a finite resource. Even billionaires have the same 24 hours each day that us plebs do. But you can keep more of those hours for yourself by using money to outsource certain tasks. The most obvious examples are housework and yard work. Like if it takes you four hours to clean your house, but you can pay a company $200 to do it for you, you just bought four hours of free time at $50 an hour. Now some people will say that this is only worth it if your hourly rate is high enough to cover that cost. But I don't think this sort of arbitrage mindset makes sense. Like if you use those four hours to go on a hike with your wife or visit your parents or play pickleball with friends, that's money well spent. Those experiences are priceless. I mean, think about it. On your deathbed, how much money would you pay to have one more afternoon with your wife or lunch with your parents? I'm guessing it's way more than $200. So buying your time back is always a good way to spend money. Number two, rent expertise. We live in an extremely individualistic society in which we're encouraged to do everything on our own. Like 50 years ago, it was common even for middle class people to outsource their vacation planning to an expert. But now we all act as our own travel agents and tax accountants and personal trainers and handymen. This often works out okay, but the truth is sometimes it makes sense to hire a pro. Like when you partner up with today's sponsor, Stitch Fix to upgrade your style the easy way. It can be hard to figure out which clothes fit your body, what colors to wear, and how to combine different pieces in a cohesive way. With Stitch Fix, you can leverage the power of technology and real human style experts to find clothes that you love and really dial in your personal style. Here's how it works. First, you take your style quiz to tell Stitch Fix about your aesthetic, your budget, and your sizes. It's very easy and only takes a few minutes. Next, you're matched with a stylist. Yes, a real person and you can share any additional notes or concerns with them. Then they pick five pieces and send your fix straight to your front door and you can keep anything you like. The foundation of my first fix or first delivery is this pair of faded black jeans in a straight fit. I let my stylist know that I have been preferring a straighter leg recently and she delivered. These jeans work well with all the tops that I received. My favorite of which is this bright blue wool crew neck. This is a piece that I wouldn't necessarily have bought for myself as I tend to stay away from brighter colors. But I actually love it. I think the color works well on me and it goes nicely with the less saturated denim. It also fits well. It's incredibly comfortable, which is an absolute must for me these days. Stitch Fix also nailed it with the shoe selection. I'm a huge New Balance fan and these BB80s are a good balance, pun intended, of comfort and style. I like the neutral colorway because it goes with any casual outfit, including this one. Speaking of casual, I also received this green North Face hoodie. I think the drop shoulder construction and comfortable fit works well with the jeans and the color is right up my alley. This is another piece that I might have overlooked while doing my own shopping and it makes me think that Stitch Fix could be a good way to inject some new life into your style if you feel like you've been in a rut. Of course, many of the items like this beige thermal henley can be easily incorporated into my existing wardrobe. It's all very interchangeable, which I love. Bottom line, I think Stitch Fix is a great service for guys who simply want to look good without spending a ton of time and mental energy on it. Your fixes will get more personalized over time as you provide feedback to your stylist. You can get regular deliveries if you'd like or just as needed. You can set a budget. The service is really designed to be adaptable to your individual needs, but no matter how you use it, you're going to save time, look great and feel more confident. Talk about money well spent. To learn more, check the link below in the description or go to stitchfix.com. Thank you again to Stitch Fix for supporting the channel. Okay, back to the list. How to spend your money wisely. Number three, buy experiences. Research consistently shows that buying things, you know, cars, phones, watches, leads to only short-term satisfaction. But investing in experiences leads to long-term fulfillment and happiness. I say investing because when you purchase an experience like a vacation or concert tickets, you get two distinct benefits. First, you get to live through the actual experience, which is fulfilling in the moment. And second, you get to replay the memories for the rest of your life. You can even share those memories with other people by telling the story. In his book, Die With Zero, Bill Perkins calls this the memory dividend. To maximize your returns on these memory dividends, it's a good idea to have as many experiences early in life as possible. Don't be one of those people who assumes they'll finally travel when they have enough time and money. You might not make it that long, and even if you do, you'll have less time to enjoy those memories. I'm not saying you should go into massive credit card debt to hit every stop on the Eris tour. I'm saying that when it comes to discretionary income, you should prioritize experiences over possessions. Number four, buy extra lives. Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin said, a reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one. This is so true. A good book can transport you into another universe or someone else's life. I loved the Game of Thrones series. Same with Harry Potter. I read both series multiple times. And yeah, I watched them too, but there's something special about a book. Whether you read it or listen to the audio version, you're forced to use your imagination to picture these characters and environments. It's not like TV where you can half-pay attention and scroll TikTok on your phone. With a book, you are entirely engrossed. My favorites tend to be sci-fi and fantasy. I just finished the Red Rising series, which was excellent. I'm eagerly awaiting for the last book, the series finale, to come out. I can't wait to read Harry Potter to my girls once they're old enough. So no matter how old you are, how much money you have, what you do for work, anybody can live a thousand lives just by buying books. Number five, buy accountability. Some people don't need any external accountability to do hard things. Intrinsic motivation can go pretty far. Like, maybe you just really want a six-pack, so you hit the gym every day and you watch what you eat. Personally, I find that I'm much more likely to stick with something if someone else is holding me accountable. I mean, if it weren't for GPAs and final exams, I never would have done any homework or cracked a textbook. Don't get me wrong. I'm not going to do anything else that I will do just because I want to, like train jujitsu or play drums or make these videos. But even those things can be a struggle sometimes. I'm much more likely to make a video if I have a sponsor and a deadline. Hey, oh really, I haven't even looked at it. I'm recording. All right, sounds good. Bye. Where was I? So if you can identify habits or activities that you know are good for you but that you tend to drag your feet on, it might make sense to invest in accountability in those areas of your life. For example, let's say that you know you should exercise more but you just can't stick with it. Hiring a personal trainer or joining a group class where you'll be expected to show up and people will ask about you if you're not there is a smart way to spend your money. Maybe you've always wanted to learn guitar and you've even bought some online courses but you just haven't made enough progress. Sign up for a few weeks of in-person lessons with a local guitar teacher. If someone else is expecting you to practice and to show up, you probably will. It's just human nature. We don't want to disappoint other people. I've always made much more progress under the watchful eye of a coach or a teacher than I have alone. So skip the new iPhone and instead go buy yourself some accountability. Number six, buy access. Another great way to spend money is to buy access to the people that you look up to and want to meet. The most obvious example is attending a conference. Much of my professional network and a lot of my close friends are a direct result of going to conferences and meetups in my industry. You know, between plane tickets and meals and hotels, this isn't cheap but I've never regretted spending the money. In our hyper online world, it's easy to forget about the power of an in-person, face-to-face meeting. It's just different. Once you meet somebody in person, you can stay connected for the rest of your life even if you rarely see each other face-to-face. It's much easier to ask for somebody's phone number when you're looking right at them. So for example, if you're an aspiring YouTuber, try to make it to one of the big conferences like VidCon or VidSummit. It's going to feel expensive and time consuming but I guarantee you'll come back feeling connected and motivated and full of new ideas. Number 7. Buy safety. There are certain areas in which it's okay to be frugal. If you're buying a new refrigerator, it's prudent to go with the mid-range option from a reputable brand. You don't need all the bells and whistles. But there are certain things that you shouldn't skimp on, especially when it impacts your or your family's safety. An obvious example is tires. You should never put off buying new tires just to save money. If they're even close to being worn out, you've got to replace them as soon as possible. And you don't have to save up for the expensive ones. A triple A study found that the age and the wear of your tires is more important than the price, at least when it comes to safety. In the same way, you should buy the right number of CO2 and smoke detectors for your home. You know, make sure you have a fire extinguisher in your house. Basically when it comes to purchases that increase the safety of you and your loved ones, don't pinch panties, just pony up. Number 8. Upgrade the boring stuff. I think it's important to avoid lifestyle creep or you spend more and more money on the big ticket items like your house and your car and travel. But I think it makes sense to spend money upgrading these small, often boring things that you interact with every day. For example, I put this 2-in-1 wireless charging station on my bedside table. It was a little more expensive than a regular phone charger, of course, but it's way easier to use in the dark and my two main devices, my phone and AirPods, are both fully charged each morning. It's a small but noticeable quality of life upgrade. Another example, I've systematically upgraded all of my socks and underwear over the years. I don't own any bad pairs and I never run out. One goes for household items. Like a few years ago, we bought a really nice cordless vacuum and it's a game changer. We use it so much that the cost per use is virtually zero. So when it comes to the stuff that you use every single day, towels and bed sheets, it makes sense to spend a little more on the slightly nicer version. Number 9. Last but not least, buy health. You should never sacrifice your health to save money. If you're not healthy, you won't live as long. But more importantly, the years that you do have won't be as enjoyable. You should think of your health span as being more important than your lifespan. Which is why any money spent on health is money spent wisely. I'm not saying you have to go full Brian Johnson and spend every waking moment pursuing the fountain of youth. I mean, many steps towards a healthier life are shockingly simple. One easy one, sleep better. Get yourself a really comfy mattress. Make sure your room is nice and cool, even if it means buying a portable AC or mini-split unit. Get a white noise machine and an eye mask and earplugs and a pillow that you just can't wait to lay your head on each night. Wear good shoes. Never sacrifice comfort for fashion. This will have consequences later in life. Go to the dentist, even if you have to pay out of pocket. You should get your teeth cleaned at least once a year, preferably twice. Get a checkup every year and make sure you understand your blood work, like ask your doctor about your cholesterol levels. Don't eat bottom tier fast foods. Spend a little more for a slightly nicer restaurant. Buy produce, fruits, veggies, and nuts. If you work on a computer all day, get yourself a standing desk and a really comfortable chair and a big monitor so you're not hunched over your laptop for hours on end. All of these things are cheap compared to the serious health complications that most people deal with later in life. So never sacrifice your health and well-being to save money. And that is my list of ways to spend your money wisely. What did I miss? What would you add? Let me know in the comments section.

        "transcript": " Almost everyone feels like they need more money. Seems like everybody is upset about inflation, everybody is underpaid. But the truth is, we all waste a lot of money. People aren't great at spending their money wisely, let alone saving it. This video is about popular purchases that are actually a huge waste of money. By the way, don't feel bad if you've bought some of this stuff. We're all irrational when it comes to money, and spending is subjective. I buy things that most people would consider a huge waste of money, like watches. No one needs a watch. People are irrational. Also a huge thank you to my go-to skincare brand, Geology, for sponsoring this video. I'll talk more about them later. First let's get into the list, starting with possibly the number one biggest waste of money, supplements. The vast majority of supplements don't work. That is simply the truth. Centuries ago, we had traveling salesmen tricking people into buying snake oil, and it worked. Nowadays, we have web-savvy business bros slinging CBD oil, and it's still working. That is the marketing tactics are working. The oil is not working. The truth is, there's no hard data to support most supplement brands' claims. That's why in every supplement bottle, you'll always see vague language, like supports healthy immune defense, or enhances mental agility. Of course, you'll also see much more specific disclaimers, like this product is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any disease. So it's like, well, which is it? Does it do anything or not? Because you're kind of saying both on the bottle. It's not. Supplements are expensive, too. This is a $100 billion industry, billion with a B. But other than a handful of time-tested, scientifically validated supplements like creatine or vitamin D, they're pretty much all worthless. And even the ones that do work aren't for everybody. After all, these are supplements, meaning that they can fill a deficiency if needed. My advice is to not waste any money on supplements unless you're 100% sure that you need them based on advice from your doctor or lab tests or very strong personal anecdotal evidence. All natural beauty products. The all-natural beauty industry is booming right now. People don't want chemicals on their skin. They want to believe that natural ingredients will make them look and feel better. Well, first off, the terms natural and clean are unregulated, so they don't actually mean anything. Because any brand can just slap these words on the label regardless of which ingredients they're actually using. Also, natural doesn't necessarily mean safe. Naturally derived ingredients can be bad for you just like synthetic ones can. Regardless, here's the harsh reality. Natural ingredients aren't as effective as synthetic ones. Take acne treatment, for example. All the aloe vera and tea tree oil in the world will not make your pimples disappear. But salicylic acid and certain retinoids will almost certainly help. These are safe and effective synthetic ingredients backed by loads of science and decades of anecdotal evidence. I'm telling you, don't waste your money on homeopathic skincare or grooming products. They just don't work. You know what does work? High quality, derm-grade skincare products with ingredients that are backed by science. Like the ones made by today's sponsor, Geology. Geology is an award-winning skin, hair, and body care company with over 10,000 five-star reviews. From moisturizer to shampoo and deodorant, they have your whole routine covered. I've tested Geology's entire lineup. I use their products every day and I can personally vouch for their quality and efficacy. This isn't a luxury brand with crazy markups. These aren't trendy products with dubious claims. It's just simple, high quality, personal care powered by dermatologists-approved ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and vitamin C. If you're new to the brand or looking to upgrade your routine, I recommend trying out Geology's personalized skincare trial set. You take a 60-second quiz about your skincare goals, then you get a personalized five-piece routine delivered to your door, including face wash, SPF moisturizer, retinol cream, and eye cream. It's a great way to test drive Geology's system for less than $10. Then if you're happy with the results, you can re-up or you can tweak your custom routine until you dial it in just right. So whether you're dealing with acne breakouts or wrinkles, or you just want to protect your skin as you get older, I highly recommend giving Geology a shot.

That's a huge discount, so take advantage of it, link below in the description. Okay, moving on. Huge Knife Sets. Too many people buy these huge 20-plus-piece knife sets. You know the kind that come in those blocks with all the slots. You see these on wedding registries all the time, and it's a great way to buy 37 low-quality knives. The truth is, you only need like three or four different types of knives, and a good knife is pretty expensive. It's not that a set is a bad idea. I mean, those blocks are actually a really good way to store your knives. I'm just saying buy a smaller one. Focus on the basics. A high-quality chef's knife, paring knife, maybe a serrated knife or slicing bread. Go for a respectable brand like Wustov, Misono, or Mercer. Get them sharpened when they seem dull. You can usually find a knife sharpener at your local farmer's market. Again, let your kids fight over them when you're dead. Generic box store art. Yes, you can buy art from places like Target or Ikea or World Market, but these are the empty calories of home decor. This art doesn't mean anything to anyone. It was mass-produced in some Chinese factory. Thousands of other people have the exact same print hanging on their wall. Personally, I'd rather have nothing on my wall than these generic mass-market prints. Now, if you see a piece that you genuinely love and really connect with in one of these big box stores, by all means, buy it. Well, let's be honest, most people are only buying decor from these big box stores to fill the empty space on their wall or on their mantel or in their heart. Instead, just be patient. Go thrifting. Go to local art and craft markets. Buy something made by a real human being, maybe even someone who lives in your town. Pay a little more for something that really speaks to you. If you're at a loss, you can never go wrong with photos of friends and family. Lottery tickets. Every year, people spend hundreds of billions of dollars on lottery tickets. Friends alone spend over a hundred billion dollars a year playing the lottery. And we all know our chance of winning big is virtually zero. It's completely irrational, just like playing the slot machines in Vegas or yelling at an inanimate object after you stub your toe on the sofa. Now, I'm not one of those people. Not because I'm smarter or anything, I'm just too risk averse with my money. I've never been drawn to playing the lottery. I like index funds. I'm practical with my money to the point of being boring, some might argue. The uncomfortable truth is, most people like me, educated, wealthier, and white, aren't spending a lot of money on lottery tickets. It's mostly lower income, less educated, and non-white people who are spending money that they don't have on lotteries they won't win. In other words, it's kind of a predatory industry. Personally, I think the lottery should just be illegal. I think this is one area where the free market has clearly failed us and the government should just step in and regulate. But that'll never happen, so the only solution is to opt out and save your hard-earned money. Bottled water. Bottled water has to be one of the biggest consumer scams of all time. Some brilliant capitalists was like, let's take something that people already have a virtually free, unlimited supply of in their house, and let's bottle it up and make them drive to the store to get less of it. Oh, and we're going to charge like 30 times more than they'd normally pay. One last thing, let's use single-use plastic containers. They won't mind. Now, obviously, I'm talking about developed countries with clean drinking water here. But that's a lot of the world, which is why the bottled water industry raked in $342 billion last year. That's despite the fact that many countries like here in the US, we have tap water that's totally safe to drink. Some people complain about the taste. Personally, I've never been bothered by it. But if you really don't like the taste, there are all sorts of filtration devices that you can buy, many of which cost less than a pack of bottled water. Food delivery services. Getting food that's ready to eat delivered to your front door used to be a luxury. I remember growing up in the 90s, we would occasionally get pizza or Chinese food delivered to the house. Those were your only two choices back then. And it was a special occasion. This is not something we were doing every night or even every week. Now people are using Grubhub and DoorDash to get whatever they want delivered on a regular basis. And they're paying for it on average an extra $2 to $5 plus tip. And it's funny because before app delivery was a thing, you would just give this $2 to $5 directly to the delivery person in cash. Now these ethically dubious tech companies are raking in billions acting as the shady middlemen of dinner. The crazy thing is you don't need your food delivered. You can just go pick it up. But even in hyper walkable cities like New York, people are still using app delivery because they just won't leave their apartment. It's always seemed so crazy to me. Like just save your $5, get off the couch, go grab your takeout. Or, this is kind of radical, cook alcohol. People spend so much money on booze. I said booze. The worst offenders are single men with high paying jobs. I think that kind of makes sense because they have both time and cash to burn. But most people, regardless of income or marital status, spend money on alcohol each month. The average millennial spends $110 per month on alcohol. That's like a week's worth of groceries or three tanks of gas or a subscription to every streaming service. And not only is it totally unnecessary, it actually leads to all sorts of health problems. I'm no T-totaler. I spend money on alcohol too. But I've cut back on my drinking as I've gotten older. And you know what? I'm healthier and wealthier for it. New phones. Before the iPhone came out, mobile device manufacturers like Nokia and BlackBerry didn't release new models every year. They launched new products when they had new products ready to launch. Incremental updates didn't get much attention. We didn't watch annual keynotes. We were just wowed every few years when some new tech came out like the first flip phone or camera phone or touchscreen. Then the first iPhone came out and it was incredible. But every year Apple would make a huge deal about the new version. Some of these updates were impressive, but especially recently, a lot of them just felt forced. Like is the iPhone 16 really that much different or better than the 15 or 14? No. Do our $1000 phones stop working after just one year? Of course not. My iPhone 13 mini is still going strong and I don't plan on replacing it until I have to. The thing is tech companies have done such a good job in making us feel like we need the latest model. And the tricky thing is our phones don't feel expensive because most of us are on payment plans through our carrier like T-Mobile or Verizon. But don't be fooled, you're still paying that full $1000 one way or another. So I say ignore the hype, if your phone is still working, there's no need to upgrade. Storage units. Isn't it crazy that we have so much stuff, we have to buy extra space outside of our house just to hold on to it all? Self storage is a $44 billion industry. Their entire blog is dedicated to teaching people how to make money in the self storage industry. There are some very cautious startup bros bragging about their storage business profits on Twitter. The crazy thing is every year 150,000 storage units are auctioned off. This means that whoever purchased those units and put their stuff in it either died or just abandoned it. I guess it turns out that whatever they were keeping in there wasn't very important to them after all. If you find yourself wanting extra space to keep your things, ask yourself, do you really want to hold on to that stuff? Could you sell it or donate it instead of paying $150 a month to hoard it away in a dark concrete box? I bet that if you let this stuff go, you'd never think about it again and you'd feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders. Extravagant weddings. The wedding industry is like Las Vegas. It's been perfectly optimized over many decades to separate people from their money. For example, a regular hair and makeup job from a salon might run you $75 to $100. But to tell them it's for a wedding and all of a sudden it's $300 plus tip. Same goes for florists, bakeries, venues, photographers. That's why in 2023 the average cost for a wedding in the United States was $35,000. This is up $5,000 from the previous year and you still see everybody complaining about the job market and inflation. Like hey, maybe don't spend the price of a brand new car or a down payment on a house on one freaking day. It's actually insane if you think about it. My wife and I had a small family-only wedding at a friend's house. Our reception was at a small brewery nearby. We probably spent a few thousand dollars total including on a pretty nice honeymoon outside of Cabo. Yeah, I got some flak about doing it this way. People are brainwashed by this industry. But you don't have to buy into the wedding madness. If you want to get married at the courthouse and spend your money on a nice honeymoon, I say go for it. Speaking of wedding industry madness, diamonds. Diamonds are one of the longest running consumer scams. And even though everybody kind of knows this, diamond sales continue to rise. Most people kind of know that diamonds aren't as scarce or precious as the diamond industry would have us believe. I mean, we now have access to conflict-free lab-grown diamonds. Yet still, the diamond industry will generate over a hundred billion dollars this year. This is largely due to people spending on average fifty-five hundred dollars on diamond engagement rings. Why? You could use that money to pay off credit card debt or student loans or go on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation. Or you could put that money in an index fund, do literally nothing, and in ten years you'll have thirteen thousand dollars. Now I get that there's a ton of social pressure to buy an expensive diamond engagement ring in the same way that there's pressure to have an extravagant wedding. You've probably heard that old adage that men should spend two to three months' salary on an engagement ring. So this ridiculous guideline was invented by De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer. That's gotta be one of the best marketing campaigns of all time. Never mind the fact that it was dreamed up by a sketchy, monopolistic company with a history of price-fixing and mistreatment of indigenous people. Let's not argue about who killed who. My point is diamonds are a huge scam with very little inherent value outside of industrial use. They're not an investment. Natural diamonds are not better than lab-grown diamonds. We all need to stop wasting our money on these dumb rocks. Home fitness equipment. Some people use their peloton every day, and that's great. But most home gym equipment ends up collecting dust in the garage or the basement. Just go to Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace and see how many treadmills and exercise bikes are listed for sale. About forty percent of Americans own home gym equipment. Oddly, forty percent of Americans are obese. Something doesn't add up. And this gear is expensive, like a high-quality exercise bike or weightlifting setup is gonna run you over a thousand dollars. For that same amount of money, you could get yourself a fancy gym membership for a whole year, a new workout clothes, and even a few sessions with a personal trainer. I think home gym equipment makes sense for people who already have an exercise habit. Like if you've been strength training four times a week for the last few years and you're ready for the convenience of being able to lift at home, yeah, invest in a squat rack. But if you don't work out regularly and you think that buying a new treadmill or a kettlebell set will transform your relationship to fitness, it probably won't. Overall, if you really wanted to go for a jog, you could just walk outside and start running. I'm just saying, be honest with yourself. Be realistic. If you do want to invest in your health, I think the best thing you can buy is a coach. Find somebody local who can hold you accountable to actually show up to the gym and get a workout in. That is money well spent. Luxury cars. Isn't it funny that we assume people who are driving expensive cars are wealthy? Because when you see somebody driving a $70,000 Mercedes, it only means one thing. They have $70,000 less than they used to. More more likely, they now owe somebody $70,000. That's like $1,300 a month for five years. And now the true cost of that car is over $80,000. So that person is literally less wealthy for owning that car, not more wealthy. And while that bends my cum with some fun bells and whistles, it doesn't get them from point A to point B any faster or safer than a cheaper car would. In fact, luxury cars are often less reliable and much more expensive to maintain. I get it. They're probably the most recognizable status symbol in modern society. Like most people probably could spot the difference between a $200 off the rack suit and a $2,000 bespoke suit. But everyone inherently understands the price gap between a BMW and a Honda. I'm not immune to this desire. In my 20s, when I was driving an old Buick Le Sabre, best car I ever owned, then after that a used Nissan Altima, not so great. I really wanted a Lexus IS250. I just loved that car. I test drove it a few times and not gonna lie, I almost bought one. But instead, I stuck with my Altima until it died. Then I shared my wife's old Sentra before inheriting a 2000 Honda Accord, which ran way better than it looked. Then after we had our first kid, I bought the only new car I've ever purchased, a Honda CR-V. And honestly, it's fantastic. So I say forget status and reputation, buy a car that you can afford, preferably in cash, unless you can get a really low interest rate, then drive it into the ground. Sports and political paraphernalia. License Sports Merchandise is a $33 billion market. And at $130 for a watered down version of your favorite NFL players jersey, kinda makes sense. I mean, that's a lot of money for an oversized polyester t-shirt you're gonna wear five times a year. People spend a ton of money on sports and political paraphernalia and memorabilia. Now I can understand paying to go see a game or to watch sports at home, although it's not how I choose to spend my time. Buying all the merch, I just don't get it. Right now, the average American has $8,674 of credit card debt. How is anyone affording $130 jerseys? The answer of course is they're not. That jersey is just getting them deeper into debt. You can still be a good fan without all the trappings. You know, trust me, your favorite players and coaches and managers and stadiums, they're making enough money. And same goes for political merch, which honestly is even worse because at least sports are fun. Monthly Subscription Boxes. There's a subscription box for literally everything. Prepping for the nuclear apocalypse? There's a box for that. Are you a quirky old cat lady? There's a box for that too. As if we all didn't have enough stuff in our lives already. In my opinion, the only subscriptions that make sense are for perishable items like razors or meal kits. But even then, it's often cheaper to just buy the exact thing you want in the right amount from a store or online. And if you're thinking that these niche subscription boxes might make for good holiday gifts, I'd urge you to think a little harder about what your special somebody might really want. Something that's not just going to clutter up their house and end up in a storage unit. Energy Drinks. If you want caffeine, just drink a cup of coffee. Energy drinks are loaded with a bunch of chemicals that don't actually do anything. Even worse, many of them have loads of sugar, sometimes an entire day's worth of sugar in one can. And the sugar-free options have lots of artificial sweeteners like aspartame, which are addictive and possibly harmful in other ways. I can see using energy drinks in very specific situations like for a pre-workout boost, but to stay up late gaming? Come on. Plus, if you do need a pre-workout boost, coffee works just as well for that. It's also safe, cheap, low calorie, even if you put some cream in it. Energy drinks are a big business. That's why there are so many different brands. They're so aggressive with their marketing, always shilling these dubious health benefits. Now they're even targeting kids, which is crazy. Save your money, just make a cup of coffee at home, or just stop drinking caffeine entirely. Designer clothes and accessories. Paying a crazy markup for brand name clothing and accessories is totally irrational. Don't get me wrong, you often get what you pay for when it comes to clothing. Like a $40 Pima Cotton t-shirt is going to be way better than the $5 synthetic blend that you find on Timu. But there's a point of diminishing returns and most designer luxury brands exist way beyond that point. Think about like Supreme Hoodies or Gucci Handbags or Golden Goose sneakers. Sure, they're probably made with high quality materials, but that's really not what people are paying for. These goods are marked up way beyond industry standards simply because of the hype. See, these designer brands are masters at creating false scarcity, dropping limited numbers of special edition products, and then using endorsement marketing like paying celebrities and influencers to be seen wearing the brand to create a desire for these products. And it works. Us humans are simple creatures, we're easily duped. But the truth is, paying $200 for a Supreme Hoodie or $1000 for a Gucci Handbag is just dumb. These are depreciating assets, mass manufactured in the same factories that regular brands are using. And despite the clever marketing, they're really just thinly veiled status symbols. I say spend money on quality, but try to be agnostic to brands and logos. Disposable fashion. On the other end of the spectrum, we have fast disposable fashion. This is even worse than designer fashion because despite the crazy markups, luxury products will probably last a long time if you treat them well. In contrast, the clothes that you buy from T-Moo and Shine and Forever 21 are only going to last one or two years before needing to be replaced. It's helpful to think about clothing and accessories in terms of cost per wear or cost per use. Like if you buy a $20 genuine leather belt and it starts cracking after say 50 wares, that belt actually cost you 40 cents per wear. But if you buy a $100 full grain leather belt and it lasts you for 10 years or 1500 wares, that belt actually cost you 6 cents per wear. Plus you'll enjoy it more. It's just a better belt. It'll look better and feel better and it was probably produced in a more ethical way. Buy less, buy better. So that's my list. I want to thank Geology again for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. Definitely go check them out. Links below in the description. I'd love to hear from you. Do you agree or disagree with my list? What are some other things that people waste money on? Let me know in the comments. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " If you're looking for an aesthetically beautiful, technology-rich desk setup, bursting with the latest and greatest in workplace commodities, I'm sorry, but you're in the wrong place. The thing is, there are so many desk setup videos here on YouTube, and I like them as much as you do. The new design, the fluorescent tube lights, and walnut wood grain. It's fun to see the newest gadgets and peripherals, and sometimes I get sucked in. I buy the mechanical keyboard, and I think if I can just find the right laptop stand, maybe I'll be that much more productive. But in reality, at least for me, new gear rarely makes me more productive. Often, it just adds more visual clutter to my workspace. Even worse, some gadgets are more trouble than they're worth. Like wireless keyboards look cool, but sometimes a Bluetooth connection can be unreliable, and batteries run out. My point is, sometimes less is more. I recently stripped down my desk setup to the bare necessities, and then I tried to add back in some thoughtful upgrades, things that would actually improve my ergonomics and workflow. And I'm pretty happy with it. As always, I'll link to everything you see in this video down below in the description. Two quick disclaimers. Some of the stuff you see in this video was sent to me for free, but I'm under no obligation to say anything specific about any of these brands. In fact, some stuff that was sent to me doesn't even appear in the video because it wasn't really up to par. Two, this video was brought to you by Veir, a really impressive watch brand that I'll talk about later. By the way, if I look and sound a bit bedrackled, I've been sick for what feels like a month. I'm kind of coming out of it now, but still feeling a bit rough. Alright, let's start with the desk. I'd been using the same 42 by 27 desk for over seven years from a now defunct brand called Fully. Its small size served me well in many different rooms, including a 320 square foot Manhattan studio. But sometimes it felt too small, especially as my monitor size has increased over the years. Now that I have more space to work with, I thought that a slightly bigger desk would make sense. This standing desk from Branch is 48 by 30, so just a few inches longer and deeper than my old one. The extra length is nice, but the extra depth is even more important. That's what she said. With the extra length, I can comfortably fit my chair underneath the desk without the legs colliding. The extra depth lets me sit far enough away from my now larger monitor. I don't switch between sitting and standing a lot, but I do appreciate the option. This dual motor desk moves up and down quickly and much more quietly than my old desk. I use the memory function to store my favorite standing and sitting positions. I like an adjustable desk because you can get it a bit lower than the standard 30 inch desk. Like if your my height is shorter and you're seated at a regular 30 inch desk, you're probably going to need a foot rest for a proper healthy setup. But if I can get the desktop to about 27 inches, I can keep my feet on the ground. The only modification to this desk is this laptop stand that I drilled in to the bottom so I can shelf my closed laptop and then plug it in so it's out of sight. This desk also has built in power in the back, including a USB and USB C port, which is a really convenient touch. So there's really only one cable running from the desk to the wall, which I ran through this white tube. And that means when I go from sitting and standing, it doesn't pull or stretch any cords. For cable management, I just wanted to make sure that you couldn't see any loose cords underneath the desk. So I used the zip ties that came with the desk to run tables. I used some double sided tape to attach any power bricks to the underside of the desk. I also used these little Velcro cord keepers to clean things up and these flexible cord wraps from NightEyes to wrap excess cordage. These are the best cord wraps in my opinion. I think they're far better than your standard twist ties. I'll link to them down below in the description. I really like this fog gray desktop paired with the white base. It's just a clean, neutral look that works well with monochromatic elements like black, white, and gray, but it also works well with any pop of color that you might add. Okay, real quick, huge thank you to today's sponsor, Veyer. I like my watches like I like my desk setups, high quality, attractive, and practical. And Veyer watches fit the bill perfectly. Here are four things I love about this brand. One, every single watch they make has a minimum water resistance rating of 10 ATM, which makes them functionally waterproof for any activity outside of deep sea scuba diving. Two, their watches ship with not one, but two interchangeable straps. Three, they make plenty of watches in smaller sizes like 36 and 38 millimeters, which is great for anybody with smaller wrists like myself. Four, they prioritize USA sourcing and American assembly. I have two of their watches here today, the A12, a dirty dozen, and the C3 design and Navy. Both are 36 millimeters with a 43 millimeter lug to lug, the perfect size in my humble opinion. Both have AR coated sapphire crystal over the dials. The A12 also has a sapphire case back, also with anti-reflective coating, which lets you gaze upon the Swiss made automatic movement. I've actually had the C3 for a few years. It was my daily driver for most of 2022. This time only watch can build up a six month power reserve from just six hours of light. It has bright blue and green loom on the hands and numerals, and it's assembled in the United States. Even if you love mechanical watches, you have to admit there's something so practical about a solar quartz. They're extremely accurate, they never have to be wound or reset. For me, a waterproof solar powered watch just makes sense. But of course, I do appreciate the engineering marvel that is an automatic timepiece. Like the A12, it's powered by the movement of my wrist. A truly symbiotic relationship between watch and wearer. It's no less durable than the C3. It still has bright loom and 100 meters water resistance due to the locking screw down crown. Like technically, these are two very different watches, but both fit my lifestyle perfectly. So if you're in the market for a new watch, whether it's a higher end Swiss auto or a USA assembled solar quartz, you need to check out Veier. Go to veierwatches.com or check the link below in the description. Thanks again to Veier for supporting the channel. Okay, where were we? Ah, chairs. This is the Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro. Same brand as the desk. It's the highest end chair they offer. This is the mesh mineral color with the optional headrest. Actually got this as a press sample before launch, but it is available now. When Branch offered to send this chair, I let them know that I already had the Steelcase Amia to their credit. They agreed that the Steelcase is a great chair. Branch's flagship is sort of a direct competitor to the Amia, but it's way more affordable. After comparing the two side by side, I have to admit that the more expensive Steelcase is better. The Armonomic Pro technically has all the adjustability that the Amia has, including armrests that move in every direction, adjustable lumbar support, adjustable seat depth, and even seat tilt, which the Amia doesn't have. But when you sit in both chairs and use all the adjustments, you just feel the difference in build quality. Like a Kia might have the same specs as a Lexus, maybe even more bells and whistles. But if you drive both cars, they feel different. The Amia has more range across the board. It goes higher and lower. The arms move farther in every direction. The chair feels smooth, not clicky like the branch. And it just works. I've used it for a few years now and I've never had a problem. I can't say the same for the Argonomic Pro. Like even when I was shooting this B-roll, the lumbar adjuster got stuck and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I'm not saying it's a bad chair. For the price, Branch has managed to build in every type of adjustment you'd want, which means this chair is going to work for any body type. It's also a very good looking chair, especially with this desk. But if money isn't an issue or if you just really want the best, I'd probably go with Steelcase or Herman Miller. Like the Amia. It's firm and supportive, looks great. It's basically everything I want in a woman. A chair. Storage cabinet. This three drawer storage cabinet is from Ikea. It's part of the Besta Storage Collection. I can't actually find it on Ikea's website, so maybe it's been discontinued. It's surprisingly hard to find office storage that's the size and shape of a filing cabinet, but that's not actually for files. Like are people really filing that much paper anymore? This one is perfect. It's on wheels. It has three different size drawers, the bottom of which is deep enough for larger items. I think it looks pretty nice too. I had a piece lily on top, which pieced out to plant heaven, so now I have this snake plant instead, which will hopefully survive the low light environment, along with this little gift from my brother, which is a reminder that we are not our thoughts. Our brains are doing their best, but like a puppy, sometimes they misbehave and need to be ignored. This and my old silver play button are the only decor in this part of the office. I'd love to replace it with the gold button that you get when you hit a million subscribers. At this rate, that'll happen sometime in late 2035. Computer. This is a 2021 14 inch MacBook Pro in space gray. So it's the first of the M series Apple laptops. It's the M1 with 32 gigabytes of memory, 2 terabytes of storage. It's still really fast. Like I can export a 4K video from Final Cut Pro with logic running in the background while working on a thumbnail and Photoshop, and this little laptop just handles it. I don't even hear the fan running. I love the 14 inch size because it's super portable and it fits in all the same bags as my old 13 inch laptop. It has the MagSafe charger and the SD card reader, which I'm so glad Apple brought back. Compared to my last MacBook, the 2017 MacBook Pro with the little touch bar that was so worthless. This one is better in every way. Better build quality. The keyboard is way better. It's faster and I haven't noticed any glitches. I plan on keeping this one as long as I can. Monitor. So first up, the monitor arm is from Fully, the same defunct brand that made my old desk. I can move the screen up and down, forwards and backwards. You can tilt it back and forth and even pivot it 90 degrees if you want a portrait orientation. I just like being able to get the monitor in that exact right position. The monitor is from BenQ. I think that's how you say it, BenQ. It's their MA320U, a 32 inch display made specifically for Mac. It reminds me a lot of my old LG Ultra Fine, which was created by LG for Apple back when the first Thunderbolt MacBook Pros came out. That was a great display because it was simple and reliable. The only problem was it didn't have any extra inputs. This MA320U is sort of like a better version of those LG Ultra Fines. It's the biggest display I've ever had and at first it was a bit jarring. I was like, did I go too big? But I got used to it very quickly and unlike with my old 27 inch Dell, I never find myself wanting more room. I know some people prefer multiple monitors. Personally, I'd rather just partition one big screen into different sections as needed. So for example, I might have a note open on one side of the screen and a browser window on the other. Or if I'm doing like color correction on a video, I'll use the whole screen. This is a much better monitor than my old Dell. The first thing I noticed was just how much brighter it gets. It also has this nice matte finish that doesn't pick up any glare, even though it's right next to a window. The monitor is color calibrated out of the box to match the color of your MacBook. It also has a bunch of other fancy color tech for like designers and editors. And you can tweak all these settings with BenQ's display pilot app. Frankly, that's a bit beyond my understanding. All I know is this monitor looks fantastic and it integrates seamlessly with my MacBook Pro. Plus, it has actually usable speakers built in. And the sound and brightness are synced to the laptop so you can use your keyboard to adjust the volume or brightness. No need to go into the monitor's menu system. It has plenty of ports to connect other devices like tablets or phones or consoles. You could totally use this as your hub. But for a cleaner setup, I'm using an actual dock that I'll talk about in a minute. Desk light. BenQ also sent over one of their popular screen bars. I've seen these all over YouTube. So many tech creators swear by them. I've never really understood the benefits though. Like, why would you want to shine a light down from the top of your screen? To do some research and more importantly, just using it for a few weeks, I kinda get it. Like, it does seem to reduce eye strain a little bit during long writing or editing sessions. I think it'd be more noticeable for people working in darker rooms or at night. Maybe if you're watching a movie or gaming after dark. You know, the point is to gently light up your desktop surface without casting any glare onto your monitor. You can even change the temperature from cooler to warmer and adjust the brightness. The ScreenBar Pro has an auto on-off function so it'll turn on when you arrive at your desk and automatically turn off when you leave. The one problem with this is it takes up the spot where you would put a webcam. I've used this for a while. Given the choice between the ScreenBar and the webcam, I think I'd choose the webcam just because it's more practical given how many Zoom meetings we have these days. I put the ScreenBar in the nice to have category and while I really appreciate BenQ letting me test it out, I'm not sure if I'd buy one for myself. But it has excellent reviews and a lot of people love it so if you're curious, I think you should form your own opinion. Definitely give it a shot. Of course, I'll link to the ScreenBar and everything else you see here down below in the description. So this is the CalDigit TS4. I used the older version of this dock, the TS3 for a few years, but I noticed that it didn't work as well with my M1 MacBook Pro. The main problem was the SD card reader became kind of slow and unreliable, but this newer TS4 version has been super fast and reliable and glitch-free right out of the gate. Since it uses Thunderbolt versus a third-party software like DisplayLink, it works perfectly with Macs. I have the monitor and all of the peripherals connected to the back of this dock so all I have to do is place my laptop in the under desk shelf and connect it to the dock with a Thunderbolt 4 cable and then I'm ready to work. I use the SD card reader instead of hunting for my laptop's SD slot under the desk. I can also use the high bandwidth USB and USB-C ports in the front to plug in external hard drives or charged devices. It's just a solid, reliable dock for MacBook users and it does work with multiple monitors as well. I've tested other flashier docks that prioritize like device switching, but I have to say this CalDigit takes the cake. I never had speakers until recently. I'd either use my laptop's built-in speakers, which are decent or headphones. The thing is, if my laptop is closed under the desk, the speakers sound terrible. And I can't really use my AirPods or the monitor's speakers for editing because they're just not accurate enough. I've always wanted a good pair of desktop monitors, something high quality enough to edit my amateur drum covers, and just to make listening to music or watching videos more enjoyable. I kept seeing this one brand audio engine recommended here on YouTube and on Reddit sort of as a best bang for your buck desktop speaker. I actually reached out to them and they generously sent a pair of their HG3 desktop speakers, which is one of the smallest models they make. I don't have a huge desk, so these are perfect. I ended up buying a set of their speaker stands just for the aesthetic. These are fantastic speakers. I have them plugged in via USB, but you can use them wirelessly too. They even have aptX HG Bluetooth and frankly, I have no idea what that means. But I can tell you that they sound full and crisp and accurate and they get really loud. Like you could use these as your main speakers in a pretty large room. I love the fact that there's a headphone jack and a volume knob on the front of the speaker and they have all kinds of inputs on the back so you could use these with like a turntable or an actual receiver. They also just look nice. They kind of bookend my setup and they work well with the color scheme. These are a serious upgrade to my setup and my video creation workflow. Links in a pinned comment. Nintendo. So the Switch isn't always on my desk. In fact, it's usually in a drawer out of sight, but every few months I take it out for a while to play some Tears of the Kingdom. I've had this game since it was released and still haven't beaten it, which goes to show how much I play. But I like it because it's relaxing, it's not super addictive and you can sort of pick it up for just a few minutes if you'd like. I will say playing on this monitor with the Pro Controller is way better than just using the console. Like if you're gonna play, it might as well do it properly. If I ever feel like the Switch is becoming a distraction, I will put it back in the box, back in a drawer to get it out of sight out of mind. But it's been kind of a pleasant occasional escape. Keyboard. For the last few years, I've alternated between a Keychron, Mechanical Keyboard and my Laptops Keyboard. Honestly, I find this MacBook's keyboard to be more comfortable than most external keyboards that I've tried. I actually prefer the quieter action and less travel. I can type faster and make fewer mistakes compared to any mechanical keyboard. And the thing is, the Keychron didn't make my hands feel any better. If anything, my hands kind of hurt after using it for a long time. So I decided to ignore aesthetic and try to find the most hand-friendly keyboard on the market. I went down the rabbit hole of ergonomic keyboards, trying all the most popular models from brands like Logitech and HP to more obscure options from Mac-A-Lee and Knock-Free. I ended up with this split, slightly-tended keyboard from a brand called Perix. I hadn't heard of this brand, but they have a good reputation amongst the keyboard and mouse geeks on Reddit. That's always a good sign. It does take a while to get used to a split keyboard, but the idea is that it keeps your hands, elbows and shoulders in a more natural position. So your hands are slightly farther apart from each other and slightly externally rotated. It also forces you out of bad typing habits, like if you're used to reaching for the wire H keys with your left hand. You can't really do that anymore. I also have feet on the front that you can use to get negative tilt. Most keyboards come with positive tilt, which doesn't make any sense if it puts your wrist in a terrible position. Negative tilt helps keep your wrist in a natural position, and for me, it makes a difference. I love the layout of this one. I like having the arrow keys over here on their own so I can find them without looking down. This is really crucial for video editing. I don't need the number pad, which results in a keyboard that's too wide. It still has the home button bank, so you can program that for commonly used keystrokes or smart commands using third-party software. And yeah, this is a wired keyboard, and it's really nice. It's always ready to go. It never runs out of batteries. There's zero lag. The one thing I miss with any external keyboard is Touch ID. I use the MacBook's fingerprint reader all the time, just to unlock the laptop or to autofill payment information. But Touch ID is native to Apple, so you won't find it on any external keyboard. And that kind of sucks. But if you have hand or wrist pain from computer use, I think it's worth getting an ergonomic keyboard. And yes, there are better-looking, split-tended keyboards out there, like this one I tried from a brand called Knock Free. But in terms of practicality, this Perix was my top choice. Trackpad. I also used the Apple Magic Trackpad at version 2, which is substantially larger than your laptop's built-in trackpad. The thing is, I've just never found a mouse that's more comfortable for my hands than a trackpad. And I've tried a bunch of fancy ergonomic mice. I've tried many different configurations, including different combos of mouses and keyboards and trackpads. I always come back to just using the Magic Trackpad. This one has excellent battery life and perfect connectivity. I keep this little magnet lightning port thing plugged in, so when it does need a charge, I just snap on this 360 charger from a brand called Static. It's sort of like a modular charging system, so you can use the same cord with different devices. Like if I want to charge my Switch controller, I can just detach this cable from the trackpad and snap it onto the controller. It's the little upgrades in life, you know? Speaking of upgrades, quick tip for trackpad users on a Mac. Go to your Accessibility Settings and enable Three Finger Drag. This lets you click and drag using three fingers. It's much more comfortable than clicking with your thumb and dragging with your finger while holding your thumb down. Super helpful for like highlighting text or reorganizing windows, even dragging media around an editing timeline. The more you know. Desk Mat. The keyboard and trackpad sit on top of this Orbit Key Desk Mat. It's their larger size and it has a couple of cool little details. First, you can pick up the top layer and put documents underneath. It's not for like long term storage, but it's a nice way to get paperwork that's still being processed out of the way. I try to go totally paperless, but sometimes you have to hold on to like a check that hasn't cleared yet. This is where that stuff goes. Second, this little channel at the top. It can be used to keep a pen and for cable management. The mat comes with this little magnet that you can pass a cord through. It's a little detail, but I like it. The only issue I have with this mat is that they ship it rolled up and it's taking forever to totally flatten out. I have another smaller version of this mat that does lay totally flat, so I know it'll happen eventually. It's just taken a long time. Charger. Next piece, I have this wireless charging station from Anker. Whenever I need a new cable or charger, I almost always buy from Anker. They just make solid, reliable products. I especially love their braided cables. I like this two-in-one station because I can charge my phone and AirPods at the same time and it keeps them both within arm's reach so I can take a phone call if it comes in. I also like the clean, simple design and I think it works well with the rest of my setup. I actually really like the iPhone's standby mode, so you can change the look and feel of it and add different widgets, but for me, I like just having the clock and calendar right there. It's perfect. And that's it. I am really liking this setup right now. I think it's not only the best looking desk setup that I've had so far, but it's also the healthiest, the most ergonomic. It's super functional for what I do, which is a lot of writing and video editing. I'm sure it will evolve over time, but this is probably the most comfortable and ergonomically correct desk setup that I've ever had and I look forward to sitting and working here every day. That's the point, right? A good desk setup is supposed to reduce friction between you and work. Ideally, it can even motivate you and maybe spark some creativity. I'd love to hear from you. Well, it's something that you either added or removed from your desk setup that actually had an impact. Let me know in the comments. Thank you again to Veier for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " A lot of t-shirt videos here on YouTube and yeah, I guess I'm throwing my hat in the ring, chasing that elusive algorithm. The thing is I get it. Nowadays, the t-shirt is probably the most important staple in any guy's wardrobe. I wear a t-shirt pretty much every day. Now the best t-shirt is the one that works well for you. It doesn't matter what the internet thinks or what some celebrity is wearing. So here are my favorite t-shirts that I've been wearing every day for the last year. For reference, I'm about five, six, 125 pounds. I have a 35 inch chest and I usually wear a size small or extra small depending on the brand. And if you're thinking, wow, you look kind of rough. Did you get in a fight or something? I did get in a fight with a sinus infection and did one. I also need a haircut. I'm kind of tired. Our pets' heads are falling off, but the show must go on. So let's get into it. Starting with the Ashen Eerie Premium Crewneck. It's a size small and white. This is a 100% Pima Cotton T designed for the shorter build. If you're not familiar with this brand, Ashen Eerie makes clothes specifically for shorter men. This T fits me perfectly right out of the box. It's a midweight t-shirt that keeps its shape. Given the shorter body length, I prefer a size small for maximum comfort and drape. Ashen Eerie makes a few different t-shirt styles, but this one is my favorite. It's not cheap, but it's worth the price for the premium materials and the perfect fit in my opinion. This T has a ribbed collar. If you watch to the end of this video, you're gonna see a very similar T, but with a self fabric collar. So you'll be able to see the difference between those two construction styles. And before we move on to the next brand, I just wanna give an additional shout out to Ashen Eerie for making outerwear that fits me perfectly. Sleeve length is always just right, no tailoring needed. I appreciate you Ashen Eerie. Speaking of shorter guy friendly brands, abbreviated apparel heavyweight T, a size small in dark gray. This is another brand focused on shorter guys. It's also a fantastic t-shirt. It's just the right length for my five, six frame. It's also 100% cotton, but it's a lot heavier than the Ashen Eerie T at 250 GSM. It's also $15 cheaper at just $30 as opposed to 45. It has a more relaxed fit, but it's not oversized. It's extremely comfortable. The top stitched bound collar feels durable like it won't lose its shape no matter how hard my one year old pulls on it. Take a chill pill Reese. One note, this is a smaller neck opening, which I think a lot of guys prefer, but if you like a little more room in the neck, this might not be for you. Number three, Asget the T-shirt. This is a size small short in white. Here's another T that fits me perfectly right out of the box. Reason being Asget offers their tops in three different lengths. So you choose your size like small, medium, large, and then you choose your length, either short, regular, or long. I'm wearing a small short and it's one of the best fitting T-shirts I've ever tried on. It's not boxy or oversized, but it's also not really slim. I love that it doesn't hug my hips like some slim fit T's do. It's just sort of a regular fit, pretty much as timeless as it gets. Made from 180 GSM, organic, extra long staple cotton. This feels substantial, but not as thick as like the abbreviated apparel T. Definitely not as heavy as number seven on my list. The ribbed neck seems plenty durable and this $55 T just feels all around premium, which is good because it's not cheap. And by the way, with Asget, you're also paying for sustainability, traceability, transparency. This is a really cool brand. They're very committed to slow fashion and to reducing apparel waste. So kudos to them. If you can afford it, I think it makes sense to support brands like this. Unique low, subpoena cotton T-shirt. I'm gonna show you two of these, an extra small and a small. Let's start with the extra small. So this is a $25 Pima cotton T-shirt and it's often on sale. This pink one is size extra small. It has a nice, somewhat slim fit. The length is actually just right after a laundry cycle. I've heard people complain about the durability of these T-shirts, but I've had a few of them over the years and they last a long time. Granted, I usually air dry them. This dark gray one is a size small and it's a bit closer to how I like my T-shirts to fit these days, but honestly, I still wear both sizes regularly. I sort of try to match the size to my pants. Like if I'm wearing slimmer fit pants, I'll wear the extra small. If I'm wearing like straight fit pants, I'll reach for the small. These Pima cotton T's are available in a bunch of different colors. And I think if you compare them to the more expensive Pima T's on this list that are like 45 or 50 or even up to $80, these offer a lot of value. You know, they are made in Vietnam. That's why they're cheaper. But still, for a lot of people, I think these are the best bang for your buck T-shirts. Five, Uniqlo Ariesm Cotton T. So this is my other favorite Uniqlo T-shirt style. And by the way, I did a video comparing every T-shirt that Uniqlo makes, you can go check that out. This is not the U Ariesm Oversize T. This is just the regular Ariesm Cotton T. It's actually a cotton poly spandex blend. Honestly, it might be even more comfy than the Supima Cotton T-shirts. And at $15, it's a steal. These Ariesm T's are cut pretty similar to their Supima siblings. They do seem slightly shorter in length, which is great for me. The synthetic blend fabric doesn't really shrink, so I usually go for an extra small. Side note, if you find yourself wanting to leave a comment like, this guy wears extra small, really just rethink all of the decisions that you've made that have led you to this point. If somehow your conception of masculinity is tied to body size, you've made some mistakes along the way. You've been misled. So stop typing, go outside. The colors on these Ariesm T's aren't quite as durable as some of the other options on this list. I have seen some kind of wrinkling over time, but still for the price, you're gonna get plenty of wear out of these. They're also really good for like hiking or working out, but they look like cotton T's, so you can still wear them with jeans or chinos. Six, Flint and Tinder Cotton Hemp T-shirt. The size extra small in the natural color. I'm actually wearing this one right now. I had to double check to make sure this wasn't Flint and Tinder's Slub Cotton T because this Cotton Hemp blend feels like heavyweight slub. It has loads of texture and feels great against your skin. The natural color is warm. It's easy to pair with any color pants, especially if you like earth tones and blues and greens. At 180 GSM, the fabric feels substantial, probably slightly heavier than most T-shirts you'll find from mainstream brands. It's made in India, but if I hadn't seen the label, I'd have assumed it was from Flint and Tinder's made in the USA collection. Feels the same to me. At the time of writing, this T-shirt is sold out in almost every color and size, but I really hope Huckberry makes more of them because they're fantastic. Now these do run long, so I actually had this one hemmed a couple of inches to fit my shorter torso. This is something I do for a lot of my T-shirts, and in my opinion, it's worth the extra money. If you have more of an average build or height, these will probably work just fine for you off the rack. If you are a shorter guy, you might have to get these hemmed or just wear them tucked in if you like that look. Number seven, Flint and Tinder American Heavyweight Pocket T. The size extra small and white. This one is made in the USA by Huckberry's Flint and Tinder brand, and it's the heaviest T-shirt that I've ever worn. Constructed from 100% eight and a half ounce cotton. This one fits kind of like that last T, the cotton hemp one, which means I also had to get it hemmed. The sleeves are a bit wider, and I actually like to wear them cuffed. It shortens and tapers them, and given the heavyweight fabric, they hold a cuff really nicely. It stays in place all day. I'm kind of feeling these heavier weight structured T-shirts for fall and winter. They can just take a lot of abuse. They seem to break in nicely over time, and that's nice because of full retail of $68. These are not cheap shirts. If you haven't worn a heavyweight T-shirt before, I'll warn you, it feels a lot different than your standard T. It's probably not for everybody, but I think they're great for the cooler seasons. Number eight, Flint and Tinder vintage soft wash T-shirt. Size extra small in the forest color. Another made in the USA T, this one from 100% four and a half ounce cotton. So it's substantially lighter than that heavyweight T you just saw. More of a medium weight. Like the other Flint and Tinder T's I've showed you, I had this one hemmed a couple of inches to fit my five, six build. After that simple alteration, it might be my new favorite T-shirt. The fit is perfect. The fabric is soft, almost like brushed cotton, but substantial. It's heavier than like the Uniclo T-shirts. I also really like this forest color, which is like a faded black with a green tint. I find this type of dark color easier to wear than like a jet black. If I had to pick one T-shirt style from Flint and Tinder, this would probably be the one. Number nine, Katen Finley pocket T-shirt. The size small in Atlantic green. So Katen was a boating supplies, turned surf apparel brand. And this is actually my first experience with it. Again, I got this one hemmed a couple of inches, but other than that, the fit is really nice. Super comfy, enough room in all the right places without looking baggy. I know some guys prefer more fitted sleeves, but I find the extra room to be more comfortable. I love the size, shape and placement of the chest pocket. Sometimes chest pockets on T-shirts are too big and they sit too low, but this one is perfect. The 100% cotton fabric feels soft, almost brushed. And I love the off white and yarn dyed green stripes. I find myself reaching for this T-shirt a lot. Number 10, Wellyn sole performance T-shirt. Size extra small in pebble gray heather. So Wellyn is one of Huckberry's house brands, focuses on performance apparel. So I guess you could say it's kind of like Huckberry's Lululemon. This sole performance T is made from cool soft fabric, which is a poly-lyosel spandex blend. It's lightweight and airy, UPF 30, quick drying and moisture wicking. But it doesn't feel sticky or synthetic. You know, some performance T-shirts kinda stick to you, they cling to your body hairs. This one doesn't do that. It's actually really soft, probably due to the semi-synthetic Lio-cell. To me though, this does feel like a workout or hiking shirt. I'd wear it with athletic shorts or joggers, even swim trunks, probably not change your chinos. Also, if I got this one again, I'd probably size up to a small for a bit of extra room. I know this one looks nice and fitted on camera and a lot of guys prefer that look. They kinda want their shirts to hug their biceps, but I think especially for active wear, it makes sense to have a bit of extra space to move around. Last but not least, Orchard and Broome Pima Cotton Tee. Size small in the dusk color. Orchard and Broome is a luxury quality basics brand for men named after a New York City intersection. This Made in Peru 100% Pima Cotton Tee fit me perfectly after one wash in size small, which almost never happens. I mean, even the length was just right. It actually reminds me a lot of the first shirt you saw in this video, that one from Ash and Erie. Wow, that feels like so long ago, doesn't it? We've been through so much. You and me, haven't we? No matter what happens, I'm just glad to be on this journey with you. Really, it's been an honor. Anyway, that Ash and Erie Tee, it had a ribbed collar, but this one from Orchard and Broome has a self fabric collar, which means that the collar is made from Pima Cotton, just like the rest of the shirt, not a stretchy ribbed material. This kind of construction is often found on higher end, more expensive T-shirts. That doesn't mean it's for everybody though. If you like a heavier, more structured collar, you probably want a ribbed collar. That said, this might be the most luxurious feeling T-shirt in my collection. And the fit was perfect without any alterations. I love the dusk color. Purple is surprisingly easy to wear. Goes well with a lot of different colors, warm and cool. It works for pretty much any skin tone, very underrated color in my opinion. So that is it. Those are the T-shirts that I am wearing right now. I know there are many other brands out there, so if you have any favorite T-shirt brands, drop them down in the comments and I'll try to check them out. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Well, it's that season again, the most wonderful time of year. That sounded sarcastic, but I actually love the holidays. These days, it's much less about the presence and more about spending time with family and friends and taking a break from work and all the tasty food. I still like giving people gifts. It's so nice when you find that perfect present for the special someone in your life. The problem is many gifts kind of miss the mark. And no one needs more stuff in their life that they're not actually going to use. So in this gift guide, it's mostly aimed at men. I want to focus on safe bets. No brainers. Gifts that pretty much any guy can appreciate. First, we're going to talk about more affordable stocking stuffers. Then we'll cover some big ticket from Santa items. After that, we're talking risky gifness. Ideas that are popular, but that take a bit of finesse to pull off. And then we'll wrap things up with some guaranteed slam dunks. And by the way, this video is about physical presence, not experiential ones. I do think that experiences like concert tickets or a really nice dinner or planning a trip are some of the best presents. My only advice is some people actually enjoy physically unwrapping a gift. So if you do get them an experience, try to get them a small physical token to go with it. Like if you're getting your boyfriend concert tickets, maybe get him a band t-shirt that he can open on Christmas morning. Okay, let's get into it. Starting with stocking stuffers. Socks and underwear. As a kid, socks and underwear is like the most boring present. Even as a teenager who probably needed fresh undies, I remember being kind of disappointed when I got socks or underwear for Christmas. Like, hello, I want the new Final Fantasy. Now that I'm of a more mature, wiser age, I appreciate a high quality set of hosiery. It's an excellent gift for guys in their 30s, 40s and beyond. For socks, I recommend dedicated brands like Smartwool, Darn Tough, or Bombas. I'll link to some of my favorite pairs down in the description. For underwear, there are so many good brands to choose from. And again, I'll link to some of my favorites in the description. Recently, I've been enjoying these silk cut, micro-model air trunks and these more traditional cotton boxer briefs from Flint and Tender. Again, links below. A light. So this brand's night eyes is great for stocking stuffers. They make a bunch of affordable, practical, EDC-adjacent items that I've gotten a lot of use out of over the years. One such item is this task light. It's kind of like a headlamp, but instead of having a strap, it has these little bendy arms that can be used to attach the light to anything. I like to attach it to the stroller if I'm taking one of the kids for a walk at night. Hey, Reese, go to sleep already. How can you be hungry when you ate three times yesterday? You could attach it to a backpack or hang it from a tent or inside a shed. It has these magnets so you can stick it to any metal surface. It has a lot of practical use cases, and that's why it makes a great little stocking stuffer gift for any tinkerer or camper or dad that you know. Night eyes, gear wraps. The same brand also sells these little bendy things on their own in different sizes. They're like twist ties, but way better because they don't fall apart and they can be reused indefinitely. I use them as cord wraps around the house and office. You could even use the big ones as hooks. They're pretty strong. I'd recommend getting the Variety Pack with different sizes and colors. It's just a solid stocking stuffer gift for pretty much any guy. A small EDC knife. Big knives might be cool, but they're not practical. Most guys aren't going to carry around a six inch blade. In some places, this is even illegal, but a tiny knife, that just makes sense. I'm talking about a knife small enough to keep on your key chain that can be used for small tasks like opening a box or cutting off a loose thread. Some of these knives even have like bottle openers built in. I've gotten a lot of use out of this little Spyderco bug over the years, both as part of my key setup and on its own. Same with this slightly larger, but still key chain friendly, Kershaw Cinder. These are really affordable too, as they're kind of no brainer stocking stuffer ideas for any EDC enthusiast in your life. If you want to spend a little more, I'd go with an internet favorite brand like Wesson or the James brand. The Wesson Microblade is very small, it's built like a tank, and it just looks cool. The James brand Palmer Utility Knife is a bit larger, but super practical. If you're shopping for a younger guy like your preteen or teenage son, I think a classic Swiss Army knife is a great choice. Hot sauce. If there's a spicy food lover in your life, hot sauce is a guaranteed home run. You can either get them a refill of their favorite varietal or something they haven't tried yet. One fun idea is to get them the Hot Ones Pack. If you're shopping for somebody that likes hot sauce, I can almost guarantee they watch the show Hot Ones here on YouTube. And they'll probably enjoy running the gauntlet and testing their resolve against a bomb beyond insanity. If you don't want to spend that much, some other great brands are Marie Sharps, Yellowbird, and Secret Ardvark. One of my personal favorite local brands is the High Desert Sauce Company. I'll link to all that down below in the description. Just don't go insanely hot unless you're sure that they're into that sort of thing. Alright, let's talk about Santa-tier presents. Big ticket items. Airpods. These are the perfect gift for any Apple fanboys in your life that don't already have wireless earbuds. I'd probably go with the Pro version, which have a few extra features including physical volume controls. Also, a lot of people find them more comfortable. If you don't want to spend that much, get the new version of the regular AirPods, which also have noise cancellation. Either way, I guarantee these will be a big hit, especially if you give them to somebody who has not yet joined the wireless revolution. Fitness Ring. If you're looking for the perfect gift for an active, health-conscious man, consider a fitness tracker. If they don't already have one, I think a Ring-style tracker is a really cool gift. I've worn the Oro Ring and the Ultra Human Air. They're both great, but I think Ultra Human might be a little better because it doesn't come with a monthly subscription. I also found it to be slightly more comfortable on the finger. The Oro Ring app is a little more user-friendly. Either way, this is a really cool present for someone who's kind of into the quantified self-movement or biohacking, or just anybody who wants to take their health and sleep and fitness more seriously. Basically, if your guy listens to the Tim Ferriss podcast or Andrew Huberman, he's gonna like a fitness tracker ring. Watch EDC Box. This thing right here. If there's a man in your life who's into everyday carry or watches, he's gonna love this. How do you know if he's into this stuff? Well, he probably has more than one pocket knife. He doesn't simply carry his keys. He has a multi-tool and maybe even a small flashlight on his keychain attached to a carabiner suspended from his belt loop. He hopes somebody will notice his wristwatch so he can explain how the screw-down crown provides 100 meters of water resistance. And why, yes, it does glow in the dark thanks to the Swiss Super Luma Nova Lume. If this sounds like someone you know, they're gonna love a durable storage display box to keep their watches and other EDC gear. This one is made by Case Elegant. It's available on Huckberry. It's heavy-duty, but I think also pretty handsome. You can keep 10 watches in here or, like I did, remove some of the partitions to make room for other objects. It also has this little drawer on the bottom for other things like pens and knives. It has a cord pasta in the back if you want to keep a smart watch in there. I'm telling you for a certain type of guy, this is like the perfect gift. Waxed Trucker Jacket. The Waxed Trucker has always been a versatile, kind of sought-after outerwear piece, but it really took off after The Last of Us aired in 2023. This was a video game turned HBO miniseries in which the main character wore this jacket in pretty much every episode. It fit his frame and his personality perfectly. This flannel-lined version is great because it's warm enough to wear and fall and maybe even winter depending on where you live. It's not a heavy jacket like a parka, but it's warmer than you'd expect. It goes perfect with jeans, chinos, or really any casual pants. You could wear it over a t-shirt or layer it over a sweater or button up. If your guy is into style, chances are he already knows about this jacket. And while it's priced reasonably for what it is, it's not cheap, so he might never buy it for himself. And that's why it makes a great gift. It comes in a few different colors. It can be hard to pick one, so make sure that whoever you give this to has a chance to exchange it for the color they want. Risky Giftness. Okay, here are three gift ideas that are very common, but that actually take a bit of finesse to pull off. Cologne. I would only recommend buying somebody cologne with two big caveats. One, don't buy somebody cologne who doesn't already wear it. They probably won't start. And two, don't just pick some random scent based on what you like. Fragrances are so subjective, it's very hard to predict what somebody's gonna like. Something like Polo Red, for example. It's very popular, they'll probably push it at the department store, but it's really not for everybody. More like polarizing red, am I right? What you can do is get somebody a refill of their favorite bottle. So if they love Creed of Ventus, but they're running low and they're probably not looking forward to spending a couple hundred dollars on a refill, you can do that for them. Alternatively, you could get them a trial set or even a monthly subscription to try some new fragrances. If they're into cologne, like they wear it every day, they'll probably enjoy this sort of sampling experience. Just don't go out and pick a random full-size bottle of cologne for somebody who either doesn't wear it or who does wear it, but has specific preferences. Watches. Watches can also be tricky because just like cologne, they're very personal. If you're shopping for somebody who doesn't already wear a watch regularly, it's probably not a good gift. If they do wear watches like every day, they're probably kind of particular about which watch they wear. And chances are they already know what they want to add to their collection. So just picking some random watches is pretty risky. Like, do you know if they want a quartz or mechanical movement? What's the best case diameter for their wrist? Should you go with a field watch or a diver or something dressy? What you can do is try to figure out what's already on their wish list and then buy that for them. If you're feeling brave, you could check their browsing history. We'll just get them talking about watches and take notes. Better yet, get them a gift card to a shop that carries multiple watch brands and take them shopping. Make a day of it. Grab lunch. Let your big nerd tell you all about the water resistance level and power reserve meter on their new wrist candy. Say things like, but how does it tick if it doesn't have a battery? And sit back and watch your man try to explain automatic watch movements for a half hour, knowing that you totally nailed Christmas this year. Wallets. Wallets have to be one of the most popular holiday gifts for men. Well, the thing is most guys are pretty picky about their wallet. That's like one of the only things that men carry with them all the time. They probably prefer a certain format like a buy folder or a card holder. Maybe they like brown leather or black or something that's not leather at all. Maybe they really want to try a minimalist metal wallet. My point is the right wallet can be an amazing gift, but the wrong one will probably be wasted. So if your guys wallet is looking like it's ready for a wallet heaven, I recommend trying to feel out what kind of brands and formats he likes. If you really can't figure it out and you have to get him a wallet, I'll link to some of my favorites down below in the description. Definitely avoid fashion brands like Calvin Klein and Michael Kors and Tommy Hilfiger. Go with a dedicated leather or EDC brand like Bellroy, Ashland, Saddleback or Akinae. Again, I'll link to some of my favorites below, but tread carefully. All right, let's talk slam dunks. Here's some gift ideas that pretty much any guy can appreciate. It costs a bit more than stocking stuffers, but they're not crazy expensive. A good belt. There are two kinds of men in this world. Those who put a lot of thought into their belts and those who never think about them at all. But both of these guys will appreciate a really good belt. The enthusiast will admire the craftsmanship and the buy it for life quality. The other guy will just appreciate the fact that he doesn't have to buy another belt for 10 years. I recommend leather, either dark brown or black. Just go with the same color as his favorite pair of shoes or boots. Something like the Flint and Tinder Maiden USA 365 belt. Alternatively, you could go with a woven belt like this one from Ascot. These are naturally stretchy and micro adjustable. This is actually the belt I wear pretty much every day. Either way, having one good belt that you can just wear all the time for years is something that any guy of any age or creed can appreciate. His new favorite t-shirt. Every man, no matter his age, build or net worth, can appreciate a really comfortable t-shirt. And most guys could use a fresh one. If you're shopping for a younger guy or if you're on a budget, I recommend Uniqlo. You can go check out my video where I compared all of Uniqlo's t-shirts, but my favorite is probably their Supima Cotton Crewneck. I also like their Ariesm tees. Those are just $15, so you can get them a few. If you want to go higher end, check out Huckberry's Flint and Tinder brand. I really like their vintage softwashed t-shirts and their heavyweight tees. If you're shopping for a shorter guy, try the Ash and Eerie Premium tee. It's a 100% Pima Cotton tee that's designed for the shorter build. Or grab a heavyweight tee from abbreviated apparel, which is another short guy friendly brand. Your man will be thrilled to wear a shirt that's not too long for him. Comfy Loungewear. In the same way, every guy can appreciate a set of comfy loungewear. You know, with a lot of people working from home and menswear becoming increasingly casual, you just get a lot of mileage out of sweatpants and sweatshirts and casual shorts these days. When I'm at home, I usually wear casual shorts, like the kind with an elastic waistband. I like these 7-inch Cotton Linen drawstring shorts from Huckberry. These can even be dressed up a little bit with a short sleeve button down. I also like these Trumble sweatshorts. They have the thickest, softest waistband I've ever seen. For joggers, my favorites are probably from Ash and Eerie. They have a shorter inseam, which is great for me at 5'6\". I also like these classic gray sweats from Flint & Tender. I'll link to some options down below in the description. A cozy top like this oversized quarter zip from Trumble is also a good pick. You know, giving someone this kind of cozy loungewear is like giving them permission to just take it easy for a bit. Who doesn't need that every now and then? House slippers. So you're gonna need some house shoes to go with all that new comfy loungewear. They help keep your floors free from debris and outside germs. They also provide a bit of comfort if you have hardwood floors or tile. Here are three good options from affordable to fancy. The Minnetonka Double Bottom Moccasin style slippers. These have more of a barefoot feel, but they're very comfortable and break in nicely. Gray's Indoor Outdoor Slippers. These are the quilted version with a cork insole, super comfortable. Geese Fine Wool Clogs. Buy it for life quality European clogs. Not cheap, but they'll last you forever. Halflinger is another good brand for this style of clog, and you can probably find that one in stores near you. These are all very high quality choices, so you really can't go wrong with any of them. Finally, your time. The most important gift you can give somebody is your time and attention. The holidays are not special because we get new things, although that's fun. They're special because we get to take a break from the grind of everyday life to spend time with our loved ones, the people closest to us. So try to enjoy it. You know, really unplug. Leave your phone in the other room or just turn it off. Stay off social media. Go for lots of walks. Stay up late and talk. Have a nightcap. Indulge a little bit. It's okay to do that during this time of year. Remember, everything in moderation, including moderation. I hope this video helps you find the perfect gift for your special someone's, and I hope you have a wonderful holiday season. Until next time, stay stylish. Gotten a ton of use of... Oh, man, I'm struggling today. Ugh. Sorry. They have the thickest, plushest waistband. Plushest. Geesevine... Geesevine..."

By the way, this is part two of the series, so go check out part one for 27 more things under $50. Also, this video is sponsored by Silk Cut Underwear. I'll talk more about them later. For now, let's get into the video starting in the home. Soft closed toilet seats. Why do regular toilet seats even exist? Soft closed is obviously the way to go. Why? No more eardrum rattling seat slamming, looking at you toddlers. For us adults, no more accidental slams. That is, until you get used to having soft closed, then you go to somebody's house who doesn't have them, and you accidentally slam the lid and everybody wonders why you're so angry all the time. I'm angry because it's almost 2025 and regular toilet seats still exist. Toto, go soft or go home. Folding steps dual. I'm shocked at how much use we get out of this small folding steps dual. Granted, we're a short household, but still, most people have trouble reaching the highest cabinet or changing a light bulb. And now that we have a toddler, she uses it all the time too. She's always moving it around from the bathroom to the playroom in the closet, usually trying to reach something that's definitely not a toy. These little things fold up for easy storage. They're like $15 and they just disappear into any cabinet or closet. We also have a larger three steps dual, but honestly, the small one gets more use. Laundry drying rack. Speaking of useful, the best way to make your clothes last longer is to stop putting them in the dryer. Of course, some stuff should never be machine dried like 100% wool sweaters or raw denim jeans, but even cotton tees and socks won't last as long if you dry them regularly. You know all that lint that your dryer collects? That's just fibers from your clothes. The dryer is literally destroying your clothing. The solution is to air dry your clothes on a drying rack. I like these collapsible drying racks because they can be folded up and stored perfect for smaller homes. I use ours all the time, even for stuff that could technically be tumble dried like these luxurious boxer briefs from today's sponsor, Silk Cut Underwear. Sure, I could throw them in the dryer, but would you take a Bentley through a Dr. Wash? I don't think so. I remember trying Silk Cut Underwear like seven years ago back when the brand was still called Tanny. This was after wearing cheap, multi-pack boxers for most of my life. It was like going from an original Nintendo to a PlayStation 3. It was an epiphany. I was like, oh, there's better underwear? Since then, I've tried all the high-end underwear brands from mainstream to obscure. And still, I always have at least a couple pairs of Silk Cut in my drawer. I've also gifted Silk Cut Underwear to many guy friends over the years, including my own family members. You know, as an active, desert-dwelling dad, I just appreciate softer than silk undies that stay fresh all day long. My favorite Silk Cut pair is their Micro Modal Air Boxer Briefs, which are made from a soft and stretchy, moisture-wicking fabric, sustainably derived from beachwood trees. These feel light and breathable. The colors are flattering. There's no loud branding or goofy patterns. It's more of a quiet, luxury kind of vibe. They hug your thighs and hips without feeling restrictive. They also have tagless and seamless construction for minimal irritation and chafing, perfect for sensitive guys like myself. Plus, despite being so soft, the patented, soft-stretch waistband holds its shape through many years of regular wear. Of course, you can get trunks, briefs, boxers if you prefer a different length or cut. Either way, these will be some of the most luxurious-looking and feeling underwear you've ever worn. Silk Cut also makes t-shirts, tank tops, and undershirts, along with some of the comfiest loungewear you can get your hands on. So if you're ready to upgrade your undies or you're looking for a slam-dunk gift for a special guy in your life, check out Silk Cut underwear. I'll link to my favorite pair down below in the description. Until November 22nd, you can use the code BROCKBROCK to buy one, get one free on orders over $49. Stack that with the code Freeshipping and you can also get, you guessed it, Freeshipping. I'm no mathematician, but that's like a 50% discount. Again, use the code BROCK and Freeshipping and be sure to place your order before November 22nd. Okay, let's move on to the kitchen. You know what I enjoy? Hot food. You know what I don't enjoy? Cleaning the microwave. For some reason, certain foods splatter all over the place when you heat them up, looking at eulazania, and one incident can just wreck the inside of your microwave. The solution? Microwave safe bowl covers. These are cheap and effective. You can get a multi-pack with a few different sizes. They also double as lids, so you can basically turn any bowl into Tupperware. If you take one thing away from this video, it should be microwavable bowl covers. Please keep watching. Milk Fomer. Now that the law comes to visit, he brings this fancy espresso machine and makes these incredible vanilla lattes with lavender and sometimes a bit of Kahlua, but most days, I don't have time for all that. I need to mainline that caffeine straight into the bloodstream. So we use a regular old drip coffee maker. It's actually just fine. Now, I don't drink it black because I'm not cool or manly, so at the very least, I'll put some cream in there, maybe a little vanilla syrup if I'm feeling kind of wild. My diet starts tomorrow. In some mornings, I will use our milk foamer to transform a regular cup of Joe into a cafe latte. It really does change the texture and the taste in a good way, and it just makes the drink a little more special. By the way, if you're a single guy and you're making a special someone a cup of coffee in the morning, use a milk foamer and sprinkle some cinnamon or chocolate on top. Then go iron your best shirt because she's going to want you to meet her parents. Cutting Boards. I don't know why, but these are the best cutting boards. Like, yeah, wooden cutting boards are cool, but they're also heavy, thick, less durable, higher maintenance, less sanitary, and let's be honest, they take forever to dry. These little Emeko TPU cutting boards, they're thin, easy to clean, extremely durable, and they dry quickly. We have three of them, small, medium, and large, but you could totally get away with just having the one medium size. I use these multiple times every day, slicing an avocado, taking a hot egg out of the toaster oven, quartering grapes, so it takes my one-year-old longer to eat them, and I can finally enjoy my breakfast in relative peace and quiet, also so she doesn't choke. I'm telling you, these are the best cutting boards. Just grab them. Food Thermometer. I don't really enjoy cooking. I'm not very good at it. It kind of stresses me out. I mean, my wife is great cook, and she regularly whips up tasty meals for the whole fam. But on occasion, I will man the grill. Nothing crazy, just simple stuff like chicken thighs and grilled veggies. I used to stress about under- or over-cooking things. Classic grilling amateur, I would try to kind of eyeball it or just like cut the steak open a little bit and check it. I started using a food thermometer, and it's so much easier. You can use these on anything, you know, food, liquid, people? The best thing is there's no more stress about ruining a steak or under-cooking chicken. If you don't already have one of these, it's kind of a no-brainer purchase. I'll link to this one down below in the description. Oxo Grill Tools. Speaking of grilling, after using cheaper grill tongs and spatula for a long time, I upgraded to these higher quality ones from Oxo. This isn't sponsored or anything, but I have to say, Oxo is one of those brands that just doesn't miss. I've never been disappointed with anything I got from them. Yes, their stuff is slightly more expensive, but it's still pretty affordable. This two-pack grill tool set comes with a heavy-duty stainless steel turner and tongs. They're both grippy, heavy, long enough to keep your hands out of the heat, and easy to clean. It's $23 well spent. Maple Syrup Dispenser. We go through a lot of maple syrup in our household. I won't tell you how much because my wife will be embarrassed, but it's gallons. I'd like to blame this all on the three-year-old, but honestly, I'm part of the problem. Actually, if you could click on some of my affiliate links down in the description, that would really help out because maple syrup is expensive. The thing is, most maple syrup comes in a cool-looking, but totally impractical glass bottle. It's hard to pour the right amount, and no matter how careful you are, it drips down the side and creates a sticky mess that just gets worse over time. The solution is a restaurant-style dispenser. This produces a neat, controlled syrup stream without any sticky residue. So if you also live in a pancake-heavy household, I highly recommend picking one of these up. And yes, I did take that shot of syrup. Dish brush. Staying in the kitchen for a moment, here's a hot take. Brushes are better than sponges. I do a lot of dishes. In our household, I'm the go-to kitchen cleanup guy. My wife cooks, I clean. I used to hate washing dishes back when I thought you had to use a disgusting sponge, but then I discovered the dish brush and everything changed. Paid off my debt. I got in the best shape of my life. I met my dream gal, and I actually started enjoying keeping the kitchen tidy. Brushes stay cleaner than sponges. They last longer. You can just put them in the dishwasher. I think they're more effective, too. I like these Joseph Joseph brushes that you can hang on the edge of your sink. Classic Amazon brand, by the way. Joseph Joseph. But despite the goofy name, they're the best ones I've found and I've tried a bunch. Links below in the description. Last up in the kitchen category, dish soap. Yeah, you're watching a guy talk about soap. You know how most dish soap has that little cap on top and it gets all gunky with like half-dried soap? Believe it or not, there's a better design now. They make these no-mess bottles that sit with the opening on the bottom and you just squeeze the whole bottle to dispense the soap. It's faster and cleaner and they're the same price as the regular bottles. I genuinely love that there's someone out there dedicating their life and career to innovating on the dish soap bottle. It's the tiny upgrades in life, you know? Speaking of tiny upgrades, car window shades. So it is very hot where I live in the Southwest United States. I'm talking 100 plus degrees all summer. This desert heat turns our CRV into an easy-bake oven. That makes it even harder to stuff a toddler into a car seat. I don't blame the toddler, you can get a second degree burn from those buckles. Many vehicles come with tinted windows but it's just not enough. So I've tried two styles of window shades. First, these small panels that sort of stick to the inside of the glass and then these mesh covers that slip over the top of the door. The panels are okay but honestly, the covers work better even though they look pretty ugly. We keep them on our cars almost all year around. This is a function-overform decision, much like buying a Honda CRV and I'm okay with it. So we have a lot of cool stuff to do. We even took our car cooling efforts to the next level by acquiring these kids car seat ice packs. My wife found these and honestly I thought it was a gimmick. As a parent, you get desperate and you end up buying a lot of stuff that isn't as useful as advertised. But these ice packs are surprisingly awesome. For example, if I'm taking my toddler to the library and I know that the car will be parked outside in the baking hot sun for a couple hours, after I get her out of the car, I'll put one of these ice packs in her seat. When we get back to the car, the seat is actually cold. We don't have to wait for the car to cool down and if she knows that the seat isn't hot, she'll get right in. Not gonna lie, I kinda want to find a bigger one for the driver's seat. Shirt anchors. You know when you're wearing a button-up shirt, if you only leave the top button-on button it looks kinda dorky? But then if you unbutton two buttons, the placket can get kinda sloppy? Shirts should really come with like a hidden button between the second and third one. But they don't, so the next best thing is these little shirt anchors. They're like small squishy pucks that have enough stick to hold fabric together but they're not so sticky that they get stuck to your shirt. Well they do get stuck to your shirt, but not permanently. They're easy to remove and you can use them several times before they lose their stickiness. I often wear these with my casual button-up shirts, kinda like this one so I can get that perfect amount of open collar. You know that kinda effortless, casual look which is funny because it takes a bit more effort to achieve it. Or if you have like a polo shirt where the collar has kinda warped and is coming off the shirt, you can use these to stick it back down. I think it's worth having a pack of these on hand. They're pretty cheap and one pack will last you several years. I'll link to these in a pinned comment. Broom wall mount. This is probably unnecessary for anybody that lives in a more modern house or apartment that actually has a broom closet, but my house was built in the 50s and it doesn't have a whole lot of storage space. It's also just not a huge house. So to keep things organized, we try to get things off of the floor when we can. This little broom, Swiffer rack fits nicely behind the laundry room door and it gets these awkwardly long tools out of the way. It's just a cheap little upgrade that's perfect for anybody in tight living quarters. Electric fly swatter. I don't know how it is where you live, but around us we get a lot of mosquitoes. It's not like Florida level bugs, but it's enough that it can be kind of uncomfortable to be outside for a long time knowing that you're getting eaten alive. Now, I don't make it a habit to kill every bug I see. Crickets, for example, are humanely removed from the house, but some critters like wasps and of course mosquitoes have to go. And this is where the electric fly swatter comes in. It'll take a mosquito out mid-flight with a satisfying zap. Don't get me wrong, it's not a permanent solution. There's an endless army of mosquitoes waiting to take their fallen comrades' place on the battlefront. You're not winning this war, but you're crazy if you think I'm going down without a fight. Phone grip. Even with a smaller phone like the iPhone 13 mini, it can be hard to hold the phone in type with one hand. This little phone grip, the Snap 4 Lux, makes it easier to hold and reduces hand strain. It also doubles as a stand that can be used in landscape or portrait mode. It's magnetized so you can stick your phone to any metal surface. It's a nice little upgrade to any phone, in my humble opinion. Mag connect for your keys. If you live in a multi-car household, it can be cumbersome to carry around multiple fobs all the time. There's a lot of bulk on your key chain and in your pocket. The solution is to make your key setup modular so you can switch out your fobs depending on which car you're taking. You could also just have two sets of keys, one for each fob, but I like the modular setup for myself. You could even use these little magnet connectors for other things like gym tags or keys that you use less often. I'll link to these ones below in the description. 360 magnet charging cables. Have you seen these? Have you heard about these? This brand Static makes these magnetic swivel charging cables. Basically you plug in whatever tip you need, lightning or USB-C, and then you use these 360 cables to quickly connect any device. The cool thing is if you have multiple devices, even with different inputs, you can use the same cable. You just pop it off one device, like an Apple trackpad that has a lightning port, and snap it onto another device, like a switch controller that uses USB-C. It's pretty cool. Like I can just have one cable on my desk that can be used to charge multiple devices with different inputs. You could use these on your phone too. You just leave the tip inserted, and then you replace your regular charging cables with these static cables. An added benefit is it actually stops your phone's port from collecting dust. It also acts like Apple's MagSafe plug, so if the cord is pulled, it'll just disconnect the magnet versus pulling your device off the counter. I don't put these in the must-have category. It's just kind of a fun little upgrade to charging cables. I'm ask. You probably don't have to buy one of these. You've probably gotten some free ones from stays at hotels or long flights. I recommend using them, especially during summer when the sunlight tends to creep into your windows at like 5 a.m. Seriously, these really work. Even if I don't think they're going to work, they always help me sleep in a bit. It's really the only way I can go back to sleep after an early, unexpected wake up. If you don't have an eye mask, I'll link to a really good one down below in the description. Finally, earplugs. If you really want to supercharge your sleep, combine that eye mask with a good set of earplugs. I've never gone hunting. I really have no desire to kill an animal, except birds. Since 4.30 a.m. and this mockingbird is going absolutely ham outside my bedroom window, sounding like an aftermarket car alarm from the mid-90s, I've seriously considered purchasing a firearm. Instead, I pop in a set of earplugs, put on my eye mask, and go back to sleep. Earplugs are a lifesaver for anybody with small kids or light sleepers. There are a few different kinds. I'll link to the ones that I like down below. Alright, that's the end of my list. As always, I'd love to hear from you. What's one thing you bought for less than $50 that had a noticeable impact on your life? Let me know in the comments section. And if this video gets enough likes, I'll make part 3. Thank you again to Silcut Underwear for sponsoring this video. Check the description for links and discounts. Thank you as always for watching, and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Some watches are special the first time you put them on. You know, watches purchase to mark a big milestone or hand it down from a parent, but most watches don't really have much sentimental value at first. You might like the way a watch looks, but the real bond comes from wearing it as you live your life. The more you wear your watches, the more memories become embedded into them. Just like how we all feel emotionally attached to our first car or how a certain fragrance can teleport us back to a different time or place. Watches become more meaningful over time, if you wear them. And I'm not alone in feeling this way, that's why among watch fans, there's this concept of the go anywhere, do anything watch. A kind of timepiece that's never out of place that could even be a one watch collection, even if it's not. Even if I had to pick one watch to wear for the rest of my life, it would be a stainless steel dive watch with a dark dial and modest proportions. Like this one, the Zodiac Super Seawolf reference 691. It's the kind of watch you can wear to a business casual office gig during the week, then keep it on all weekend as you're running errands at the pool with your kids or taking your better half out to dinner. Why a diver? They just make sense. They're durable by design, they're built to withstand the elements and to be submerged. Many watches can't do that. And I don't know about you, but when I go to the pool or the beach, I want to wear a watch that I don't have to worry about. Like if I take it in the water, I know it won't get damaged. I don't want to have to hide my watch in the bottom of my shoe and hope that it's still there when I get back to my umbrella. I want my watch to stay where it belongs, on my wrist. And that's why I've always loved dive watches. I mean, anybody who's into watches probably has a diver or three in their collection. And while there are thousands to choose from, for me, a great dive watch has to check a few boxes. First, it has to be actually water resistant. Like this reference, 691 has 200 meters of water resistance, so you can actually take it swimming and snorkeling and even diving. Of course, getting caught in the rain or doing dishes with this on won't be a problem. Second, I prefer a brand with some heritage. I just enjoy a brand that has contributed to the trade of watchmaking, a watch that has a story behind it. Like Zodiac, they've been in the watch game for over 140 years, starting off with handmade pocket watches back in the late 1800s. This brand helped pioneer complications that we now take for granted, like the power reserve indicator. Then in the 1950s, Zodiac launched the Seawolf Collection, some of the first actual dive watches that regular people could buy. And this 691 reissue actually pays homage to those early mid-century Zodiac divers. Third, I prefer a mechanical watch. There's just something about having a small piece of analog gear attached to my person as I move about my increasingly digital life. I love the symbiotic relationship between watch and wearer. You know, with an automatic, the movement of your body powers the watch. With a manual wind movement like this one, you put your energy into the watch via the daily ritual of winding it up. It's something you have to remember to do, like marking off the day on an old-fashioned wall calendar or brewing your morning coffee. Sure, you could get a quartz watch, you could just use your phone. I think that's what makes it special. It's something that we choose. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I want a watch that looks good on my wrist. I have somewhat thin wrists at about 6 1\u20444 inches around. And it can be hard to find a diver that has a low enough profile that doesn't overpower my wrist. This Zodiac Super Sea Wolf Reference 691 reissue, a precursor to the brand's legendary Sea Wolf skin diver, has a 36mm case. So it's retro by today's standards, but perfect for me. It's also pretty thin for a dive watch at just 12mm, so it's ready to slide under the cuff of any shirt. With a compact 44mm lug to log in a tasteful 18mm lug width, this 691 has modern engineering housed inside of old-school dimensions. By the way, a quick note on watch size. Many camera lenses make watches look bigger than they actually are, and your phone's lens is like the worst offender. That's why a wrist shot taken with your phone always looks a bit off. To get a more realistic idea of what a watch looks like on your wrist, look in the mirror. It's always going to look a bit smaller in the mirror, and that's closer to how the human eye actually sees it. The more you know. Back to my point, this Zodiac is the perfect size for my wrist, and that means it checks all the boxes for a go anywhere, do anything watch. Let's take a closer look at it. The 36mm stainless steel case features a unidirectional countdown bezel and sapphire crystal over a glossy black dial. The applied numerals and hour markers are highly legible. With just three lines of printed text, it's a clean, uncluttered dial, especially by today's standards. The bottom crown is marked with Zodiac's logo. It's grippy and easy to turn. The quick release three-link bracelet, also stainless steel, tapers down to a butterfly deployment clasp that has a slight bit of stretch built in for comfort. I've actually never seen this, and I have to say it's really comfortable. If I get elected, all water fountains will be soda fountains, and all butterfly clasps will be stretchy. Vote for me. This Swiss diver is powered by a hand wound in-house mechanical movement. The new STP1-12M. It has a 40-hour power reserve, plenty of juice for a daily driver. You can use the bezel as a countdown timer. For example, I'll often write in 20-minute sprints. If I just line the minute hand up with the 20-minute hash mark, my timer is now set. When the minute hand reaches the black triangle, 20 minutes is up. I have to say this bezel is perfectly aligned with the minute markers, and it's extra clicky, satisfying to fidget with. ASMR. The hands and oversized Arabic even numbers are filled with creamy, superluminova loom. Loom is also used to mark the odd number hours and 12 o'clock, as well as the frame style second hand pointer. It's powerful loom with a bright green glow, and that's actually the only color you're going to find on this little dive watch. If you prefer a more colorful timepiece, you should take some time to browse the rest of Zodiac's Super Seawolf collection. The brand is sort of known for their fun color combos like Cream Sickle and Watermelon. They also have some interesting dials like Malachite and Lapis. If you like the style and proportions of this reference, 691, but you want a lighter dial, you should consider the limited edition Cream Colorway available from Kraft and Tailored. Of course, you can never go wrong with black on stainless steel, and that's why this is my preferred reference. To me, this reissue really does feel like a vintage dive watch, but without relying on artificial patina, which can be a bit gimmicky. It's the size, it's the manual winding movement, and the uncluttered dial, the mid-century styling. It all just comes together to produce a subtle old-school vibe. At the same time, it's good to know that the inner workings, the actual mechanical movement housed inside this 36 millimeter case, are the latest and greatest that Switzerland has to offer. Although unlike an actual vintage watch, this one doesn't have to be babyed. You don't have to leave it at home when you head out for your beach vacation. And that's great, because you should wear your watches as much as you can. Make it your companion through good times and bad. Wrap it in your memories. Build that sentimental value over time. With time, this little watch that you bought because you liked the way that it looked will become one of your most prized positions. And maybe one day you can pass the memories and the sentiment onto somebody else. I want to thank Zodiac Watches for supporting the channel by partnering with me on this video. It's pretty cool to be able to work with a 140-year-old brand that's still making their watches in the heart of Switzerland. I'd love to hear from you. What do you look for in a go anywhere, do anything watch? Let me know in the comments. Thank you as always for watching, and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " There are so many little touch points in your home. You know, things you interact with every day or at least look at every day as you go about your life. Most are functional, some are purely aesthetic, but all of these things impact your quality of life for better or worse. Like if the light bulb was out, it's gonna bother you every time you walk into the room. This video is all about optimizing all of those little things around your house or apartment to make sure that your space is working for you and not against you. Real quick, this video is sponsored by my favorite skincare brand, Geology. I'll talk more about them in a bit. First, let's get into the video, starting in the bedroom, if you catch my meaning. Motorized blinds. When we bought the house that we live in now, most of the windows didn't have any coverings. And after some research, we realized that motorized blinds weren't that much more expensive than manual ones. I was surprised by this. Honestly, I thought that motorized blinds were unnecessary, maybe even gimmicky, but my wife thought they were a good idea and she was right. They're amazing. They reduce wear and tear because there's no strings, there's nothing to break, nothing for kids to play with. They make it easy to control shades that are behind furniture, like behind your sofa or bed. You can raise or lower multiple shades with one push of a button. These electric motors only need to be charged like once every six months. You can either get little solar panel chargers if you never want to think about it. I'm not saying that I would replace good working manual blinds with these, but if I was buying new window coverings anyway, I would definitely consider paying just a little bit more for the motorized variety. Blackout shades. Even if we didn't get electric shades, we were definitely gonna get blackout window coverings, especially in the bedroom. And make such a huge difference, especially during summer when the sun comes up early. If you combine blackout shades with a white noise machine, you're on your way to the best sleep of your life. Speaking of upgrades, most guys would do well to upgrade their skincare regimen. And the best way to do that is with today's sponsor, Geology. It's an award-winning skin, hair, and body care company with over 10,000 five-star reviews. After using their products for the last four or five years, I get the hype. They sell simple and effective, DermGrade products, everything from eye cream and SPF moisturizer to body wash and deodorant. But I wanna focus in on their retinol night cream, which I use every evening. The problem is, fellas, our skin's cell turnover rate slows down as we age. This is what causes wrinkles and fine lines and uneven skin tone. Retinol accelerates cell turnover to slow down signs of aging. It's a safe, scientifically proven, anti-aging ingredient, and I think it should be part of every single guy's routine. Now, the best time to use retinol is at night before you go to bed, and that's where Geology's retinol night cream comes in. This stuff also has niacinamide for elasticity and hyaluronic acid for hydration. So you put it on before bed and you wake up with a smoother, younger-looking face smiling at you in the bathroom mirror. You should check out Geology's personalized skincare trial set. You take a 60-second quiz and you get a custom five-piece skincare routine that includes face wash, SPF moisturizer, retinol face cream, and eye cream. Over 500,000 people have upgraded their skincare routine with Geology. If you wanna join their ranks, use the code Brock80 to get 80% off your first personalized skincare trial set and 50% off any add-ons. You heard that right, this is an 80% discount. Check the link below in the description and use the code Brock80 at checkout. Okay, back to the bedroom. King-size bed. If you have the space and the funds, I highly recommend getting a king-size bed. It feels so much bigger than a queen-size bed. It's like you and your bedmate each have your own little island. Sure, you can cuddle up in the middle if you want, but when you're ready for your own space, you know that there's a nice, cool patch waiting for you off to the side. And that's one of the biggest benefits of going king-size. It's so much cooler because you have a lot more space between bodies. Plus, if you have kids, they're gonna think your king-size bed is a trampoline and it's a bit safer to jump on than a smaller bed. Wireless bedside charger. I don't think wireless charging is necessary everywhere. Wire charging is still way faster. But there's one place where it makes sense and that's the bedside table, you know, your nightstand. I know we're not supposed to have our phones in bed, blah, blah, blah. But I usually listen to like an audiobook or a podcast to help me fall asleep. Otherwise, it's just me and my memories and regrets. Anyway, the thing is with the charging table, I often forget to plug my phone in because I fall asleep while I'm listening. And the cord likes to fall off the back of the nightstand and it can be hard to find the cord in the dark. If I need my phone in the middle of the night, looking at you, Reese, I can be hard to unplug it and plug it back in in the pitch black dark. So a MagSafe wireless charger just makes sense. I like this two-in-one charger from Native Union via Huckberry because I can charge my AirPods at the same time. So when I wake up, my phone and AirPods are both ready to go fully charged. Soft-closed toilet seats. Why do regular toilet seats even exist anymore? Don't manufacturers know that soft clothes is available? The only downside to a soft-closed toilet seat is that you get used to them and then you end up slamming regular toilet seats. And then everyone wonders why you're so upset and it's like, I'm upset because you don't have soft clothes toilet seats in your house, Gary. That's why the best move is just to have soft clothes throughout the house in every bathroom. Actually, one of our toilets still needs this upgrade. Do as I say, not as I do. Entryway storage. I know that newer houses have like mud rooms and foyers with plenty of storage built in, but our old 1950s rancher just opens up right to the living room. There's no hallway or built-ins. And I'll be honest with you, this area is always a bit of a mess. It's just a natural dumping grounds for things like bags and shoes and mail. To help with this, we added three things. And by we, I mean my wife and I put my name on it. One, this Ikea shoe cabinet. This is a shallow cabinet. It's just deep enough for shoes stored kind of vertically and it's bolted into the wall. It comes in white, but my artsy wife added this cool wallpaper to make the unit look less Ikea. It also has a small drawer up top that becomes kind of a junk drawer and then a surface that we can use for like valet trays to keep our keys and sunglasses in my wallet. Two, this pegboard. I think this one is from Etsy. And the cool thing is you can customize it with different hooks and pegs. So you can add different sized shelves or you can just use hooks to hang things like backpacks and hats, which is what we do. Three, this bench. We actually got this from a local craftsman. It's the perfect size for this space. And it's nice to have something near the door that you can sit on to take your shoes off and put your shoes on. We also store like our house shoes and slippers underneath it. The coat hooks over the bench are also from Etsy. I got this a long time ago and have brought it to all the different places that I've lived. We mostly use it for hats and sweaters and jackets. Taken together, these three things are a huge improvement over what we had. Sure, the space still gets messy. Yes, I cleaned it up for this video. It doesn't always look this tidy, but it's much better than what we had. The right light bulbs. When we moved in, all of the overhead lighting in our house had these ultra bright white daylight bulbs. They felt kind of out of place in like the living room and the bedroom. It's fine during the day, but like in the evenings or when you're eating dinner, it's kind of weird to have these bright daylight bulbs. So I replaced most of them with slightly dimmer, warmer bulbs and the whole vibe changed. I think there's a right type of bulb in terms of brightness and light quality for every room. Like in our bedroom, I put a super low wattage, extra warm bulb in the bedside lamp and it produces a nice cozy feel. But then like in the kitchen, you might want bright daylight bulbs. My point is I recommend putting a little bit of thought into what kind of light you want in a trume and during different times of day. Wapping out light bulbs is a relatively easy and affordable way to upgrade the look and feel of your space. Nightlights. Speaking of lighting, here's an even easier and cheaper way to improve the vibe and the safety of your home. Buy a multi-pack of dim light sensing nightlights and put them in a few key places. I have one in each bathroom and one in the kitchen. The light only comes on when it's dark and the sensor is very reliable and it just creates this nice soft glow. It's just enough to see where you're going without having to turn on the light. This is great for midnight snacks or trips to the bathroom, midnight snacks in the bathroom. Seriously, they're great, they're cheap, you should buy some. House plants. This one is fake. You can improve almost any room with a house plant or three. Seriously, any room. I'm talking the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, closet. My go-to is the trusty old pathos. This is a fast growing vine that can tolerate really any kind of light and it's easy to propagate. So you can buy one and a year you could have like 20 of them. Tiny succulents work well for smaller places and they're very hard to kill. They require very little water. I like putting them on shelves. A larger leaf plant can add a dramatic touch to any corner although these can be higher maintenance. If a plant's not doing well, just move it somewhere else. It might just need a different kind of light. But if you want your space to look and feel a bit more sophisticated, just add a plant. Floating shelves. Shelves are a great alternative to wall art, especially for those of us who live in smaller homes. You know, a picture on the wall is purely decorative but if you put up a shelf, it can be decorative and functional. I like floating shelves. They're a bit harder to install but they look better. They look more integrated with the actual structure of your home. What should you put on your shelves? Anything. Sometimes it makes sense to store stuff there that you use regularly that you want within arm's reach. Or you can just display some of your favorite objects. I recommend choosing meaningful things like gifts that people gave you or souvenirs from different places. When in doubt, go to a local maker's market or hit up thrift stores to find something interesting. Try to avoid buying stuff from like Target or IKEA just to fill the space. A high quality dish rack. We all know those cheap plastic drying racks that get all gunky and move around when you try to use them. Those are fine for recreational dishwashers but for power users, you're gonna want something with a bit more horsepower. I'm talking commercial grade, like this simple human heavy duty dish rack. I'm the go-to kitchen cleanup guy around this house and with two young kids and a wife who likes to cook, I do a lot of dishes. I don't mind at all. It's actually pretty satisfying. I put on a podcast and it becomes a Zen-like experience. And this dish rack was a huge upgrade. Finally, there's enough space for a whole days worth of bottles and utensils and cutting boards. When I emptied the dishwasher, there's room for all the stuff that's still wet, looking at you Tupperware. My wife actually got this drying rack for me as a birthday present, which just goes to show how well she knows me. One of the best gifts I've ever received, 10 out of 10. GFCI outlets. When we bought our old house, the inspector noted that the outlets were all old and should probably eventually be replaced. Given that we had a one-year-old and another bun in the oven, we decided to just get it done. So we ponied up and had all of the outlets replaced with the latest and greatest GFCI variety. I didn't even know these kinds of tamper-proof outlets existed. Like these new outlets, you can't get shocked by sticking your finger in them. Even if you put a metal object into one of the slots, you still won't get shocked. It's not that they're 100% safe, but they're way safer than the old ones. Now we don't tell our kids that they're safe. We still treat them as if they're dangerous because we don't want to encourage our kids sticking forks into outlets in general. But it's nice to know that in our house, the outlets are modern and safe. They're also just better than a lot of the old outlets. Plugs stick into them better. They all have three prongs. This wasn't a cheap upgrade, but it was worth the money, in my opinion. Modern light switches. Similarly, we swapped out all of our old mismatched light switches for modern ones that are all the same in every room. This is a pretty cheap upgrade, and it makes a difference because you interact with light switches all day, every day. We went with the rocker-style switches throughout the house, and we made sure that any panels with multiple switches were in the right order. A small but noticeable improvement to everyday life. A fresh coat of paint and accent walls. A fresh coat of paint goes a long way, and this is true whether you buy a new house or an old one. Even if you're renting an apartment, a fresh coat of paint or an accent wall can really change the look and feel of your space. A lot of new houses are painted with this builder-grade white or gray paint, and some higher quality paint, even if you stick with white, will look a lot better. It's gonna feel cleaner and brighter. But while you're at it, I recommend doing a couple of accent walls. It's really not much more expensive. It's just a couple extra pints of paint because you don't need much for one wall. And they just make your living space feel so much more customized and unique. We did accent walls in the dining area, in our bedroom and also the kid's room. And I feel like the whole house just has so much more personality now. Like our bedroom legit feels like a hotel room. I love going in there. So yeah, fresh paint and an accent wall. Mini-split air conditioning. So this is a big ticket item. It is not cheap, although it's way cheaper than replacing your HVAC. Splits are small climate control units that are built into the wall permanently. So they're kind of somewhere in between like a window unit and central air. And they're great for cooling down a room or a part of the house that the HVAC doesn't reach. Or just for like cooling or heating a room without spending the money to cool or heat the whole house. We got one in the bedroom because I sleep way better when it's cold. You know, we don't wanna blast the whole house every night that's expensive. And we also don't want the kid's rooms to be super cold. This was an expensive upgrade, but it was worth every penny to me. I have the mini-split on a schedule. So at like seven, eight o'clock, it starts cooling the bedroom all the way down to 65 degrees. And then it shuts off in the morning. I'm telling you, it's an absolute game changer, especially if you tend to run hot in bed, mini-split. Keyless lock. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need any physical keys. You know, every lock would be digital and preferably automatic. Like if you got close to a door, it just unlocks. We're not quite there yet, but you can still replace locks with keyless versions. I haven't done this throughout the house, maybe one day, but we did replace our shed lock with a keypad. We use this shed a lot to store like bikes and yard equipment and toys, but I didn't like going in the house and finding the shed key every time I needed to open it. The keypad is so much more convenient. I would love to have this kind of lock on like the front and back doors too, but that's a bigger project, maybe one day. Shower heads. Showers with weak water pressure are like socks that slide down your calf, disappointing. Oftentimes, it's just the shower head that's the problem. And this is great because compared to like hiring a plumber and getting a new shower head is easy and cheap. I actually like really simple shower heads, not the kinds with like a million different spray options. I don't like the rainfall ones. They never have good pressure. Just a simple, powerful shower head. So if you're not happy with the pressure in your shower, I would consider a new shower head before more expensive and involved fixes. Everything I mentioned here is something that I bought that I actually use in my own space. I hope you got a couple of good ideas from this video. Thanks again to Geology for supporting the channel. Check the link in the description. Use the discount code. And I want to hear from you. What's an upgrade big or small that had an impact on your house or apartment? Let me know in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Let's talk about Fight Club. I remember this movie coming out in 1999, same year as the original Matrix. It was actually an incredible year for cinema. I wasn't allowed to see Fight Club when I was in the theaters because at the time I wasn't allowed to see rated R movies and I wasn't yet at the point where I was disobeying my parents. So I had to wait until it came out on DVD and yes, this is before streaming. I remember watching it for the first of many times. And oh boy, was I blown away. I mean, the visual effects, the writing, the freaking casting, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden has to be one of the most iconic characters of a generation. Still to this day, when you ask guys what their ideal body type is, many of them will say Brad Pitt and Fight Club or maybe Brad Pitt and Troy. Definitely Brad Pitt until they realize what it takes to get that body type of course and it's a different story. My point is Fight Club blew my teenage mind just like it did for millions of other guys who were coming of age in the late 90s and early 2000s. And with millennial pop culture making a comeback, all things 90s are cool again. I've seen references to Fight Club popping up on the internet and social media lately. Like I've seen teenage TikTokers with Fight Club posters in their bedrooms. It's pretty weird and yeah, kind of makes me feel old. And I don't really know how today's teenage boys and young men feel about Fight Club, but let me tell you, the impact on my generation was tangible. Seriously, like tiny watered down Fight Clubs were popping up in suburban basements across America, leather jacket sales spiked. Guys got tattoos of their favorite Fight Club platitude. There was just something about the anti-consumerism, red pill, snap out of it messaging that just really made you question your life and the things you supposedly cared about. Like yeah, maybe I'm not my fucking khakis. Now, I read the book too and I know that the author Chuck Palinick might have had other interpretations or other messages behind his story. But most people interpret Fight Club as a satirical critique of consumer capitalism. In other words, they take it more or less at face value. And at face value, it's a dark story. The arc of the main character is tragic. And while he does learn some meaningful lessons along the way, the ending is not happy. So rather than blindly glamorizing Fight Club and specifically Tyler Durdin's philosophies, I wanna take a look at what this movie, what this story got right and what it got wrong. Let's look at seven key lessons from Fight Club and see if they hold water. Number one, everyone should get in a fight. There's a pivotal scene in the first act of the movie where Tyler Durdin asks the narrator, Edward Norton, to hit him as hard as he can. I want you to hit me as hard as you can. What? I want you to hit me as hard as you can. Why? Well, he poses the question, how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? On the surface, this almost makes sense. It's kind of badass, but it's not true and it's horrible advice. You should avoid fighting at all costs. Fighting is dangerous. Sometimes it's deadly. There's almost never a good reason to fight. Don't get me wrong. Fighting for sport in a controlled environment can be fun. I think lots of young boys and young men rough house for good reason. It's kind of in our DNA. I do Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which involves some pretty intense sparring and it's a blast. But training martial arts or even fighting MMA is way different than a no-hold barred street fight. I think you can scratch that primal itch for combat in a safe way through something like jiu-jitsu or boxing. But choosing to actually fight somebody when you don't have to or starting a fight is insane. It's stupid. It's like driving without wearing a seatbelt. Tyler Durdin was wrong about this one. You don't have to get in a fight to truly know yourself. Number two, I don't wanna die without any scars. I don't wanna die without any scars. This is sage advice and I actually try to live by it. I'm not reckless, but I don't shy away from things that might cause some wear and tear like my aforementioned jiu-jitsu hobby. And it has caused a couple of tears and a bit of wear. I don't need to die from old age with a pristine body. I'm okay with some injuries, some patina. Cut spruces, even scars. These are like nicks and a sword or creases in a leather boot. Our bodies are meant to be used and pushed. Scars are a map of our lives. They tell a story. So I agree with Durdin here. You shouldn't shy away from activities just because they might be a little bit dangerous or they might cause a little bit of damage. Number three, the things you own end up owning you. Do you remember that early scene in Fight Club where the narrator is describing his apartment and all of the things in it? And it sort of feels like you're inside of a West Elm catalog. Then his apartment blows up and all of his stuff is destroyed. And according to Tyler Durdin, this is a good thing because the things you own end up owning you. The things you own end up owning you. There's some truth to this, but in the movie, it's taken to an extreme. We need things. It's okay to like the things that you own. It's okay to care about them and to wanna upgrade them and to put some thought and to research into the things that you buy. The truth is Edward Norton's character had a really nice apartment. I would love to live there. It's okay that he cared about his home's aesthetic. Now, of course, consumerism can go way too far and it often does. And I think this is what Fight Club was addressing. But you don't need to feel bad about owning or wanting nice things. And you definitely shouldn't try to be a minimalist just because of social pressure, just because it's trendy. Minimalism is not a virtue and it's not for everyone. It can be just as toxic as consumerism. So unless you're a hoarder, you're probably okay. Don't overthink it. Number four, you are not cackies. This is true. At the end of the day, if you did lose all of your nice things and your perfectly curated wardrobe and even your job, who would you be? Well, you'd still be you. You aren't your possessions. You're not your clothes. You're not even your job. You're valuable just because you're you and you're here. We all use these status symbols as a sort of armor. A nice watch, a cool car, the right outfit. These things make up our identity. They contribute to our self-image and to how other people see us. And I think Tyler Jordan was trying to tell us that they actually aren't that important. You know, what really matters is how we spend our time and our relationships with other people. Number five, self-improvement is masturbation. Now self-destruction. Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction. This is kind of the logical conclusion of Tyler Jordan's belief system. It's nihilism. Life is meaningless. Don't try to improve yourself. Don't worry about other people. There's no point to any of this. In some ways, it's an alluring philosophy, freeing even, but it's wrong. Self-improvement is not a waste of time and self-destruction is just stupid. No matter what you believe, everybody knows that we only get one life here on earth. It's not a dress rehearsal. And that alone makes it meaningful. Personally, I love self-improvement. I read self-help books. I listen to productivity podcasts. I believe in therapy. I believe in fitness. Why not? You know, what's the alternative? Sitting on the couch all day and playing video games and just being cynical about everything and everyone? That's a waste of life if you ask me. So yeah, go try to improve yourself. Number six, it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. Losing all hope is freedom. There's some truth to this. I mean, you see it in real life when people have a brush with death. And afterwards, they kind of appreciate the things that really matter. They quit their job to travel or spend more time with loved ones. Fight Club shows this literally like when the narrator's apartment explodes and he loses everything he owns. Then he loses his job, which was a big part of his identity. But the thing is, you don't actually have to literally lose everything to make use of this Buddhist-inspired wisdom. You can simply simulate loss or even just visualize it. For example, stoic philosophers might practice poverty. They'd intentionally live with less for a set period of time. And that helps you face the fear of losing everything. Like if you went without your phone for a full week and realized that nothing bad happened, nobody died, you're still here, you'd probably be a little less attached to your phone. You could also visualize the worst case scenarios in any situation. So bombing a presentation or failing a test or getting rejected by a potential date. Picture yourself surviving these situations because you will survive them. And honestly, they're gonna be way worse in your head than they are in real life. So yeah, losing everything may be freeing in some ways, but you don't have to actually lose it all to get a bit of that clarity and meaning in your life. Number seven, this is your life and it's ending one minute at a time. This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time. You are the same decaying, organic matter as everything else. Memento mori, this Latin phrase means, remember, you must die. It seems morbid, but I've actually found that for me, contemplating death is an energizing motivator. It can really help me snap out of a funk because Tyler Durden was right, life is finite. And if you picture yourself as an old man on your deathbed, at that point in life, what will really matter to you? That's the stuff that should matter now. So yeah, your life is ending one minute at a time. So is mine right now. I've been recording this video for 22 minutes and now I'm 22 minutes older. I have 22 minutes less life to live. That's okay, it just makes me want to make the most of it. Wrapping up, Fly Club was a great movie. It's one of my favorites, but it was fiction. It's kind of a dark story and the ending was not happy. Also, it was satire. It went to extremes in order to make a point. And yeah, Tyler Durden is super cool and yes, he has great abs. It doesn't mean that we should follow all of his advice. But I want to hear from you. I want to know how old you are when you first saw Fly Club and what sort of impact it had on you. Let me know down in the comments. If you like this type of video, give it a thumbs up, leave a comment, maybe share it. That way I'll know to make more content like this. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish, but don't get in a fight."

        "transcript": " Alright, it's been about 10 months since my last EDC update. I've made a couple little tweaks, couple changes. Let's just get into it. I wanna thank Nomad Lane for sponsoring this video. I'm gonna show you their popular Bento bag and their newer sling. Both are great for travel and EDC. I'll talk more about them later. First, let's get into the video. Okay, so we'll start with probably the most important part of any modern everyday carry, which is the phone. I don't know how tech YouTubers do it. Like, their stuff always looks so clean. These things are fingerprint magnets. This is the iPhone 13 mini. I actually thought it was broken because it was having trouble charging and it wouldn't connect to car play via USB. So I brought it to a Verizon store. And of course they told me that it was broken. The lightning port was damaged. There was nothing they could do. I had to buy a new phone. But then I brought it to a repair shop and in like 10 seconds, this guy pulls out a tic-tac-size dust bunny from the lightning port. Something that I tried to do myself, but couldn't. He said that was the problem and he didn't even wanna charge me. So I gave him 10 bucks. As I sat in my car enjoying my newly reliable Apple CarPlay, I reflected on three lessons learned. One, phone salespeople can't be trusted. Two, repair shops are underrated. And three, upgrading is often unnecessary. I really like the size of the 13 mini. And the iPhone no longer comes in smaller sizes. You can either get the regular or like the max, which is just way too big in my opinion. Sure, the latest generations have slightly faster processors, probably better cameras, but in my hand, the 15 feels too big. So I'm glad I got this phone fixed instead of upgrading or replacing it. I'm probably gonna keep using it until it slows down significantly or until the battery degrades. One small change here, as small as this phone is, it can still be a little bit hard to hold in one hand like while typing. So I've been testing this little Snap 4 Luxe from a brand called O-Snap. From my research, this is the lowest profile and highest quality phone grip slash stand that you can get. It's thin, it works with wireless charging and MagSafe. It seems to work well with or without a case. Like even if I have this leather case on, this one from, it's called Nomad Goods that I've been using for a while, the Snap 4 Luxe still sticks onto the phone just using the magnet and I can still wirelessly charge. I haven't decided yet if I wanna use it with or without the case, I kinda like having a case on the phone just to protect from drops. But what you're really supposed to do with this thing is pull the back off and use the adhesive to semi-permanently stick it onto your phone or your case. I'd prefer to use it without the case just to cut down on the bulk. Just can't commit. Anyway, this definitely makes your phone easier to use with one hand. It's also like kind of fidgetable. It's easy to prop up on the table like if I'm watching a YouTube video while I'm eating breakfast or FaceTiming somebody. Can also prop it up that way in vertical mode. It's pretty satisfying. And of course you can also stick your phone to any metal surface like the squat rack at the gym or your refrigerator. It's a very strong magnet. Bottom line, I think this is a pretty nifty, relatively affordable upgrade to your phone. And of course I will link to it below in the description along with everything else you see in this video. I've also been carrying this juice box power bank just in case I need to charge up on the go. It doesn't happen often, but when you need to charge, you usually really need it. And again, this one uses MaxSafe so you just stick it on the back of your phone like that and then boom, starts charging. Like I said, I don't use it all the time, but it is a lightweight way to combat the old battery anxiety. I'll link to this below as well. Okay, let's take a sec to talk about today's sponsor, Nomad Lane. I heard about this brand years ago from my friend Baron who runs Effortless Gent. And by the way, if you like my content, you will love Effortless Gent, so go check that out. Baron travels a lot and he's always sworn by Nomad Lane's bento bag as like a personal item or a carry-on, especially for people who like to pack light. Now that I've gotten my hands on the latest and greatest iteration of this bag, version four, I kind of understand the hype. I haven't really seen anything else like this bag. It's kind of like a blend between a laptop bag, a duffel and a small carry-on. Like you could use this for a business trip or a weekend getaway or even a longer vacation if you pack light. It's shaped like a structured weekend bag, but it opens flat like a suitcase. So unlike any duffel, you can actually pack folded clothes in this without them getting all wrinkled up. And it's much easier to get your clothes without digging through everything. The bento bag fits comfortably under airplane seats. It has a padded laptop sleeve and an external water bottle pocket and luggage sleeve. So you can slip this over the handle of your rolling luggage. Plus it comes with a toiletry pouch, a tech organizer and a shoulder strap. And these two pouches each have their own little easy access compartments. So for example, if you're going through airport security, you could just quickly grab your liquids without rifling through the main compartment. Then there's the Tamadachi sling. I almost said Tamagotchi, but no Tamadachi. Then there's the Tamadachi sling, which comes in two sizes. This is the larger one, the 2.5 liter in black. I can easily fit all of my everyday carry in this bag with room to spare. I can even fit some wipes and a couple diapers in here. So it could be like a very compact diaper bag. It would be perfect as a personal item on an airplane. The magnetic clasp is practical. It's satisfying to use. Like the Bento bag, this just feels premium. It feels like it could take a beating. And it has all these little details, like a stretchy key leash so you can unlock a door without actually taking your keys out of the bag. It also has a good amount of organization, but not too much. You know, some bags just have too many compartments. This one is just right. I could go on, but the bottom line is, I think I'm gonna get a lot of use out of these bags. If you wanna check them out for yourself, I'll link to both bags below in the description or you can go to nomadlane.com. Moving on to keys. You know, many people don't think about how they carry their keys. You should see my wife's key set up. It's chaos. But I hate having an untamed, pokey mess of keys in my pocket. And that's why, my friend, I've gone pretty deep down the rabbit hole of key organization. And yeah, sometimes I use that as an opening line when I'm talking to girls at the bar. Just kidding. I don't talk to girls. Gross. But for real, I have tried all of the most popular key wrangling widgets on the market. I even made a whole video comparing the best key organizers, which is a few years old, but it's still relevant. So you can go check that out. And I almost always go back to the simple carabiner because unlike most organizers, it gets the keys out of your pocket. The problem is, carabiners don't work without belt loops. And especially during summer, I'm often wearing casual shorts that don't have belt loops. That's why recently I've been liking this set up. I have all of my keys on this little key smart mini, which is basically just like a better key ring. That's basically like my home keys and office keys. Then I attached my gym tag and my fob on the end. The thing is we're a two car family and I always have hated carrying two fobs around. It's so bulky. So I'm using these little key smart magnet connectors and I can just swap out the fob depending on which car I'm driving. So I never have to carry both of them at the same time. You know, it's the little things in life, but for me, this was a big upgrade. I mean, if you have all this five keys, a gym tag and two fobs in your pocket, that's madness. So I've reduced some bulk with these little magnet connectors and I'm also playing with this little key smart dangle tool. So you can use this as like a carabiner to basically hang the keys on your belt loop. All told, this is a pretty elegant solution in my formerly modest opinion. Is it perfect? No. Do I lay awake at night longing for a completely digitized world in which keys have become obsolete and teenagers don't make fun of my no show socks on TikTok? Of course I do. But until that dream becomes a reality, this setup is working just fine. Let's talk watches. Now, if you actually follow this channel, you might be expecting me to talk about this recently refurbished Rolex Datejust. I made a whole video about that piece, which you can go check out if you're interested. Today, I have something new and exciting to show you. By the way, this box is from Case Elegance. You can find it on Huckberry. I'll link to it below. It can store 10 watches and even a plugged in Apple Watch, but it's modular. So I'm using it as more of a hybrid watch slash EDC storage box. So it has a few watches, a couple of knives and some watch tools. Don't worry, I'll talk more about this in future videos. The watch I'm wearing today is from a brand called Christopher Ward. You know, Christopher Ward is one of those watch brands that I've admired for years from a distance, but I never really got any wrist time with one of their pieces until recently. The brand generously sent me this C63C Lander in Dragonfly Blue. And it is a stunner. You know, when you're a little kid, it's like really important to have a favorite color and you really think about it. Like what color represents me? I could never decide between blue and green. I just love them both. And this dial is like the perfect blend between those two colors. It also has a complimentary pop of orange, most noticeably on the GMT hand, which can be used as a 24 hour clock or to track a second time zone. Speaking of which, do you know how hard it is to find a 36 millimeter GMT? Usually the more complications you add to a watch, the bigger the watch gets. There aren't many watches with a GMT hand and a date window housed in a tasteful 36 millimeter case. And this is cool because for me, no matter how good looking a watch is, if it's bigger than say 38 millimeters, I just won't wear it. It looks too big on my wrist. My sweet spot is really like 34 to 36 millimeters. And that really limits your options, especially for GMTs. So I just want to say kudos to Christopher Ward for making such a tastefully sized GMT watch. It's so cool. I also really like this consort bracelet, which is sort of like a Jubilee five link bracelet, but this one has a butterfly clasp. Very cool. It also has some micro adjustability built in in a very clever way. So on each side of this butterfly clasp, you can just adjust the bracelet by a few millimeters and you can do that on each side. So you can really get the perfect fit, which is awesome because oftentimes on bracelets with butterfly clasps, they're either too loose or too tight. But you know, you can get this on other bracelets and I think it would look good on pretty much anything or any other style of strap. I kind of let's try it on a rubber strap, but one with the curved edges for that integrated look. But this bracelet is very comfortable and I think pretty eye catching too. People compare the white and black versions of the C63 to Rolex's Explorer II, which I can kind of see, especially if you put it on an oyster bracelet. But this configuration with the consort bracelet and the dragonfly blue dial feels totally unique to me. Like I said, this is my first time wearing a Christopher Ward watch. And you know, they get really good reviews here on YouTube and I'll be honest, it exceeded my expectations. So if you are looking for that entry level luxury tier watch, or dare I say affordable luxury, but like actually affordable luxury, I think that this brand should be on your shortlist. Wallets, just like with keys, I'm pretty, how do you say, particular about my wallets. I guess most guys are, because it's like the one accessory that pretty much every guy carries. And we actually use it all the time. Over the years, I've increasingly preferred minimalist wallets, usually like card holders. So these are like slim, low profile wallets that don't actually open. I love that kind of wallet because you can carry it in your front or back pocket. It makes you mindful of what you're putting in it. And it just sort of vanishes. You don't even think about it. I haven't carried like a buy folder or a tri-fold in a long time. But this German brand Reform Carry sent out one of their card holders a while back. And it's been my daily driver for months. It's just such a good design. It's made from a synthetic rubber, which is kind of dry. It feels like nylon. It's an incredibly slim wallet with one of the best layouts that I've ever seen. It's not leather, but it still feels premium. I love that there's no visible branding on the outside. I wish more brands would do this. But my favorite feature is this magnetic closure. It's just very satisfying. And you get the sense that anything in the interior pockets is safe. It's not gonna fall out. So I keep my ID and my main credit card on this outer slot. That's the stuff that I use most often. On the inside, I keep three lesser used cards. On the other side, I keep some folded cash, my health insurance IDs, and of course my gold level membership to the local zoo. If you're on a hunt for a better wallet, I think this one is worth checking out. Solar powered Radio Shack Calculator. Now when I'm out at a fancy dinner with a hot date, I often try to stealthily pick up the check. I'm talking somewhere nice, you know, Red Lobster, Sizzler. And maybe you can relate, but sometimes I just get so distracted by my date's beauty that when it comes to calculating the tip, I just go blank. I know there's a shortcut like you move the decimal and you multiply by something, but I just can't concentrate. That's why I always carry my handy-dandy pocket calculator from my favorite tech retailer, Radio Shack. Incredibly, this one is powered by sunlight, so it's always ready to math. And I know what you're thinking. Can't you just use the calculator on your phone? Sure, lesser men might do this, but a gentleman never pulls out his phone at the dinner table, especially when seated across from a literal perfect 10. That's just low class. If you wanna keep things dignified, I recommend heading to your local Radio Shack and picking up one of these clever little gizmos. AirPods, Gen 2. Sticking with technology for a moment, I've mentioned the AirPods in my last couple of EDC updates. I still have the first pair that I bought. They're still going strong, no battery degradation. In an uncharacteristic move, I bought the second generation AirPods Pros when they were on sale, like 30% off on Amazon Prime Day. Thanks, M, for the heads up. I figured I'd just save them for when my Gen 1s inevitably died. But of course, I opened them up immediately and test them out. And I have to say, they are a noticeable improvement on an already really great product. The two biggest changes are the upgraded transparency mode, which is now adaptive, like it will automatically pause if you start talking and then it'll start again when you stop talking. It'll get louder or quieter based on what's happening in your environment. Then there's the physical volume controls on each earbud. With Gen 1, you had to either use Siri or change the volume on your phone. Using your phone is inconvenient and kinda defeats the purpose of going wireless and asking Siri to turn the volume down or just playing goofy. So the physical volume controls a huge upgrade. Basically, my Gen 1 AirPods Pros have been relegated to backup duty. These are now my daily drivers. I highly recommend AirPods Pros, especially if you're an Apple user. If you're not in the Apple ecosystem, there are probably better earbuds that cost less and sound better. But they're not designed by Apple in California. I almost forgot something. My sunglasses. These are the Ray-Ban Franks. I mostly wear cheap sunglasses because they take a beating, like I wear them to the pool. My kids play with them. They get plenty of sweat and sunscreen on them. But I do have this one nice repair from Ray-Ban. Now I know that Ray-Ban is owned by the Evil Juggernaut Corporation, Luxotica. And they're not even that nice. Like there are much better brands out there. They're mass produced. They're probably overpriced at full retail. I get it. But they feel pretty good to me compared to most other brands. They're heavy. The lenses are nice compared to cheaper brands that I've tried. I like the brown hue. It has a good amount of darkening and it just gives everything a nice glow. These are my go-to for long drives. Mostly I like the size and shape of these sunglasses. They're kind of like aviators, but a bit more angular in a subtle sort of way. They don't have that full tear drop shape. The width and the lens height works really well for my somewhat narrow face. Kind of feel like an LAPD bike cop, circa 1978. My only gripe is when I move around, these tend to slide down my nose a little bit. Maybe I can get them adjusted so they don't do that. But basically I don't wear these if I'm gonna be active. I wear them for like driving and things like that. If I got another pair of these, I might go with titanium because I feel like it could be a lot lighter and it might stay on my face a bit better. Jewelry. So I always wear a watch on my left wrist and I pretty much always wear this bracelet on my right wrist. It's a simple silver chain. This one is actually from Amazon. It's made by a brand that I had never heard of called Pore Jewelry. But it's surprisingly high quality. It's made in Italy from real 925 sterling silver. I've worn very similar ones from brands like Mianse and Mianse, Mianse, I don't know. But this feels basically the same at like one fourth of the cost. If you wanna check the current price, I'll link to this exact bracelet down below in the description. It's a 2.5 millimeter box link chain, which is the perfect size in my opinion, at least for my wrist. Very subtle, very understated, but it's not so thin that it feels like it's gonna rip off. I love the Franco box chain shape. It's sort of a squared off chain, which is really industrial looking, but not super chunky. Great size for my wrist. There's not much slack, but there's enough slack that it's easy to put on and take off. Along with my watch and bracelet, I usually wear this four millimeter slightly curved platinum wedding band on my left ring finger. Simple, timeless, indestructible. And at night, I've been wearing this ultra human air to track my sleep. I've worn the ORA ring in the past. I find this ultra human a bit more comfortable. The tracking is basically the same. I don't wear it during the day because it just feels like kind of a lot going on to have like two rings and a bracelet and a watch. So it's basically just a sleep tracker for me. I think if I was more into like the bio hacking, quantified self type stuff, I'd probably wear it all the time, but it's just a bit bulky. So for me, it's not worth wearing it 24 seven. Most days I don't even wear the wedding band because I feel like my hands just like change size and shape during the day. You know, they swell up and then go back down. So I just find rings to be generally kind of uncomfortable. It's weird because I'm not bothered by anything on my wrist like watches or bracelet, but rings for some reason, I just don't like them. Don't worry, my wife doesn't care. It's not a problem. That's it for today. I want to thank Nomad Lane again for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. This sling and the bento bag are both fantastic. I highly recommend them. And I'll link to both of them down below in the description. If you have any questions about anything I showed you or anything else, any suggestions for me, leave them down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching. And until next time, stay stylish. Forgot about the gum. I also carry this gum. More of a Trident guy than Orbit really. I feel like Orbit used to be good, but they kind of went downhill. Private equity probably got involved or something. Trident original though, it's where it's at. Anyway, hey, go check out these other videos. I think you'd like those too. Thanks for watching. Bye."

        "transcript": " Alright, let's talk about some clothing and accessory purchases that seemed like a great idea at the time, but ended up being a waste of money. Actually, most of these weren't really a waste of money, but I'll explain why at the end. Starting with my first custom jacket. After college, I worked for this small communications agency, and even though I was junior level, I occasionally had to meet with clients. I decided that I need a couple of sport coats or blazers because I didn't yet understand that dressing up does not equal dressing well. So I went to the same tailor that my dad had been using for years, Christopher Kim, in the fancy Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, DC. And I spent like $600 on these two jackets. The construction was great, the fabric was very nice, but the fit was way off. These jackets had wide padded shoulders. They were cut full through the chest and the stomach, and the overall length was way too long for my shorter build. They were probably a size 38 with a couple of alterations, like shortened sleeves. Little did I know, I really needed like a 34 short. I didn't understand back then that fit was more important than fabric or color or price or brand. The thing is this tailor, Christopher Kim, was a nice guy and he was actually a good fit for my dad, who had a stockier build than I did, and a more conservative sense of style because he worked as a consultant in Washington, DC. But he wasn't a great fit for me. I did wear these jackets quite a lot, but I never really felt good in them. I didn't understand why, but now I know. Speaking of fit, regret number two is skinny fit pants. I started learning about improving my personal style during the hashtag menswear era, which was in the early to mid-20s. During this time, slim and skinny fits were all the rage. I had never worn close fitting clothing, like in high school or college, so I was reluctant to get on board with this trend. But once I tried it, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a thin guy. I have pretty skinny legs, so for me, putting on a pair of slim or even skinny jeans just felt like wearing jeans that finally fit properly. These pants looked on me the way that regular fit pants look on regular shaped guys, but I'll admit, I took it too far. I bought some pants that were just too skinny. Specifically, I had a pair of skinny stretch jeans from the Gap and skinny fit jeans from Uniqlo, and these were the tightest pants I'd ever bought. I got a ton of wear out of both of them, but I wouldn't wear them now. They weren't quite as timeless as I thought they were. In fact, nowadays, I think I'd find them pretty uncomfortable, even on my slender little chicken legs. I'm not wrong. I'm still not a fan of super baggy pants, but my silhouette has definitely loosened up over the past couple of years, and honestly, it's pretty comfortable. You know what two things I don't regret buying? Good skin care products and sun protection. And today's sponsor, Geology, has you covered for both. I've been using Geology products for like four or five years now. This is an award-winning skin, hair, and body care company with over 10,000 five-star reviews. And having extensive experience with a lot of their products, I kind of get the hype. They sell simple and effective, derm grade products, everything from face wash and eye cream to deodorant and shampoo. But I want to focus in on their moisturizing cream with SPF 15, which I use every morning. It goes on like lightweight lotion, hydrating your skin all day without feeling heavy or looking shiny. It's very dry where I live, and I've struggled with dry, flaky skin. One layer of this moisturizer is all you need to combat that itchy feeling. But if you've watched any of my skincare videos, you know that it's the ingredients that really matter. This face cream contains niacinamide for elasticity, hyaluronic acid for hydration, and SPF 15 for sun protection. This is a must for me since it's so sunny here in the Southwest United States, and damaging UV rays are a leading cause of visible aging. In other words, this stuff will help you keep that youthful glow for as long as possible. I recommend checking out Geology's personalized skincare trial set. You take a 60-second quiz and you get a custom five-piece skincare routine that includes face wash, SPF moisturizer, retinol face cream, and eye cream. Over half a million people have upgraded their skincare routine with Geology.

Another popular millennial fashion staple circa 2014 was the Heritage Boot. Now, I don't mean to imply that these aren't cool anymore. There's always going to be a demand for high-quality heritage menswear. There are niche communities that get really into this stuff, and I get it. There's something about a really nice pair of leather boots. And the Grail Boot, like 10 years ago, was the Alden Indie. These were cut above all the other brands like Iron Ranger and Wolverine. But man, they were so expensive, like $500, $600 plus. And where I lived, there was nowhere to try them on in person. So I ordered a gently used pair from Grailed that technically fit properly, but the thing was they were just never comfortable. I don't think they were too big or too small on paper, like according to the Brandic device. It's just that that specific last didn't work well for my feet. But I thought they were so cool. I needed that sweet, male-fashioned advice karma. I really wanted them to work. So I did wear them quite a few times for a few months before finally giving up on them and just reselling them on Grailed. I actually ended up wearing a much cheaper pair from Thursday Boots for many years. And even though the quality wasn't as good as Alden, obviously they were a third the price, they were a lot more comfortable. So just because something is popular or desirable doesn't mean that it's the best choice for you. Regret number four, designer glasses. I never needed glasses until my mid-20s when I noticed that far away objects looked just a little bit blurry. To this day, I had the same very mild prescription and I pretty much only wear glasses when I'm like driving at night or at a movie theater. When I bought my first pair, I made the mistake of going to a glasses shop in a really nice neighborhood. I didn't have much money back then and there were no online brands like Warby Parker where you could do free home try-ons. You had to go to a store. So I'm at this store in this bougie neighborhood, seated across from an eccentric sales lady. I can still see her spiky blonde hair and distinct aquiline features. She's bringing over various frames to try on, not really talking about price just yet. I have no idea what looks good on me, but I kind of like the two-tone color of these guys. This lady is really selling them. Once she sees that I like them, she's like, oh yeah, they look amazing. You look great. So I bought them and after adding in the prescription lenses and taxes, they were over $400. I tried to play cool with the cash register, but honestly, I felt kind of nauseous. I wore these glasses mostly because I couldn't afford another pair. Obviously, I still have them. I actually keep them in my car just as like a backup pair in case I forget my others. But these are not the right frames for my face. The lenses are way too short, which makes my long, narrow face look even longer and narrower. Once again, I didn't understand that fit trumps everything else. And that's true even when you're buying accessories. Regret number five, raw selvedgeans. Much like heritage boots, I always wanted to break in a pair of raw selvedge denim. I saw all the sick fades, the guy is much cooler and attracted than myself were achieving on the internet and I wanted to be part of that club. I tried a few times over the years to get into raw selvedge denim, but it's just not comfortable and the indigo dye gets on everything. I always gave it up. Well, one day I'm in New York with my friend Nick from Stridewise and he's taken me around all these high-end denim shops. I end up buying this pair from Naked and Famous. This was going to be the one. Finally, I would have my own sick fades to show off on the internet. I would have enough likes and upvotes to last a lifetime. But guess what? It turns out that being a father to two kids under three years old and living in the scorching hot snoring desert isn't exactly conducive to wearing raw denim every day. Like, why did I think this would be possible now when I never did it in my easy child-free east coast days? Bottom line, these are still brand new. Actually haven't been able to bring myself to sell or donate them because maybe one day. Regret number six, watch straps. In the watch collecting community, there's a lot of talk about swapping out straps. Like, you're kind of encouraged not to just stick with the default strap that your watch comes with. If your watch comes with a bracelet, try it on a leather strap. If it comes on leather, put it on a nylon. Going to the beach, put it on a tropical. Do you have both X and Y chromosomes? Buy a bondonato. I totally bought into this and ended up with a small army of various strap types and colors. And I like some of them, but nine times out of ten, I prefer the strap or the bracelet that a watch comes with. And this is especially true for mid-tier or higher end watches. But even cheap ones like the Casio F84W or the F105, I like the strap the Casio makes. It's perfectly fine and sometimes it's actually more durable than a strap from a third-party brand like Barton. I'm not saying you shouldn't try different watch straps. It's just that in my opinion, the enthusiasm can go a bit far, at least for me. Regret number seven, Alpha Industries Parka. As a smaller guy, I often struggle to find outerwear that actually fit my build. Like that wasn't too bulky or long. This was especially true back before there were like specialty brands and custom options for guys who don't have off-the-rack builds. I spent most of my life living on the East Coast where it gets pretty cold and often snows during winter. So when I first tried on the Alpha Industries N3B Parka in slim fit, I couldn't believe it. It actually fit pretty well. It wasn't super bulky and the sleeve length was pretty good. Now at the time, the only color available in the size that I needed was this one. I really didn't like the faux military details and the bright orange accents, the shiny outer material. But I overlooked these things because the fit was decent and I really needed a heavy jacket. Every time I wore it though, it just didn't feel right. It felt like too young for me. I didn't actually like the way it looked. For that reason, I ended up getting rid of it after a couple of years and I learned an important lesson which is not to settle. But I'll talk more about that at the end of the video. Regret number eight, the Margiela German Army Trainers. I've always loved the look of German Army Trainers. After testing the waters with a more affordable version, I eventually got my hands on the real deal, the Maison Margiela Gat replica. They're noticeably more high quality than the cheaper versions and they might be the most luxurious feeling sneakers that I've ever actually handled in person. But they're stupid expensive and after wearing them for a long time and trying to really break them in, I realized that they're simply too narrow for my feet. Now everybody says that leather boots or sneakers will stretch out over time so even if they feel snug at first, they'll become comfortable as you break them in. This is only partially true. In reality, leather only stretches a few millimeters max. You can't expect a sneaker that's too short or too narrow to stretch out enough to really accommodate your foot. So if it doesn't feel roomy enough when you first try it on, it's probably too small or just the wrong shoe for you. This was the case for me with these Margiela Gats. Actually the length is fine but they're just too narrow. It's too bad because I think the design is awesome. They're a really cool alternative to like your plain minimalist white sneaker. If they came in a wider width, I'd probably wear them a lot but they're just too slim, too narrow through the toe box and that's that. By the way, if anybody wants to buy these, I'll give you a good deal so hit me up. Regret number nine, a tan wool top coat. So I had this one dark gray top coat or overcoat from Banana Republic. I wore it a lot when I was commuting to a business casual office job in Washington DC where it gets pretty cold during the winter. I love that coat. I actually still have it. So I figured I'd double down and get another one from the same brand, Banana Republic, in a different color. And a tan or camel seemed like a nice complementary color. The fit of this jacket was solid, just like the dark gray one I had the sleeve shortened. It was a wool blend but felt high quality enough. What I found though was every time I opened my closet, I ended up reaching for the gray coat and not the tan one. There was something about the tan color that just didn't work for me. It was almost like it was too much. It looked great on other people. Look great on the hanger. I just didn't like the way that I looked in it. And the thing is I didn't actually need two overcoats. The dark gray one worked with any outfit. I eventually donated the tan one and like I said, I still have the gray one. Obviously, it barely ever gets worn here in Arizona. Regret number ten, this hat. Now, here's the thing. I don't look good in hats. Like any hats, I look goofy in any type of hat. And this includes the simple baseball cap. I remember seeing the Polo Bear hat and wanting one so bad. I just wanted that laid back dad hat aesthetic. I felt like it fit my personality. And so knowing full well that I've never been happy wearing a baseball cap, I went into the Ralph Lauren store in New York and I bought this one full retail. Not that it's like crazy expensive or anything, but still. And guess what? It looks dumb on me. I still wore it quite a bit for about a year, especially when I was growing my hair out and I just needed something to hide the awkwardness and shame. And to be fair, I think that's the best I've ever looked wearing a hat is when I had longer hair. Hats just look cool with some wavy hair spilling out from underneath them. But I still never felt comfortable wearing this hat because it's a hat. And I've pretty much given up on baseball caps unless I really need one like if I'm going to be out in the sun for a long time. I rationalize this by telling myself, self, you have pretty good hair. Why should you hide it with a hat? It's really just acceptance that hats are one accessory I can't really pull off. And yeah, I still have it. Let's talk about some lessons learned. So despite the title of this video, I actually don't really regret these purchases. Yes, I did lose a bit of money, but I learned some valuable lessons too. Number one, fit is the most important aspect of style. If a jacket or a pair of glasses doesn't fit the way you want it to, don't buy it. Nothing else really matters as much as fit and it's okay to be very picky about this. Lesson two, comfort is key. Some boot styles just don't work well for your feet. Don't expect tight sneakers to stretch. If your lifestyle has you chasing around little kids, your kids, not other people's, maybe you raw denim isn't the right move for you. And by you, I mean me. Three, don't settle. If something fits you, but you don't like the color, don't buy it. If you like the color, but it doesn't fit, don't buy it. Don't buy anything just because it's on sale. When considering a purchase, it should either be a hell yes or a no. Four, trust your gut. If you buy something and you wear it a few times, but it just never really feels right, it's fine. It doesn't matter what the internet thinks or what's trendy, just trust your instincts. And number five, let go. Don't hold onto stuff just because you paid money for it. If you don't actually wear it, you should donate it or try to sell it. Like this hat, it's haunting me. Every time I see it, I'm full of regret. Do as I say, not as I do and let these things go. But I want to hear from you. What's one thing that you bought that you regret and do you still have it? Let me know down in the comment section.

        "transcript": " Don't you hate when you're wearing a button-up shirt tucked in and you lift your arms up to do something like hug a very tall person or get a coffee mug out of the cabinet or dunk a basketball and your shirt pulls out of your pants and becomes a partially untucked mess? And now you have that old muffin top waistline that totally ruins your fit. Or worse, your shirt has come all the way untucked in certain spots. And that nice clean tuck that you started your day with has been ruined for the first of many times. Because you know that even if you fix it now, it's going to come untucked again later as you're moving around throughout the day. It's so tucking annoying, frustrating as tuck. Is this inevitable or is there actually a way to keep your shirt tucked in all day? That's what we're going to find out. Real quick, huge thank you to Lestrange for continuing to support the channel by sponsoring this video. Lestrange is a London-based menswear brand that makes modular staples designed for versatility and comfort. Perfect for guys who want to build a high quality capsule wardrobe that's pretty timeless. Their flagship piece, the 24-trowzer, is great for anyone who wants to move away from your classic slacks to something a bit more modern. It has a hidden elastic waistband, so you don't have to wear a belt, which I love. Lestrange also makes a more traditional regular fit chino pant that has belt loops and a French bearer closure. That's like an extra little button on the inside of the waistband. Both pants are made in the Tuscan region of Italy from breathable regenerative cotton. You can also get the 24-trowzer in an extra lightweight marino wool that they call tropical wool. Perfect for those summer weddings. And these pants come in a bunch of different very versatile colors. The chinos have a middle of the road regular fit and the 24-trowzers come in slim or relaxed fit. The slim follows the shape of your leg, but it's definitely not tight. The relaxed fit is almost straight with just a subtle taper down to the ankle. If needed, these pants can be hemmed or you can roll them inward to the perfect length. And this is nice because you can adjust the length to fit whatever shoes you're wearing. I think the 24-trowzer feels a slightly more smart casual than the chinos, but both of these pants are very Swiss Army knife, if you know what I mean. You can wear them with button-ups or sweatshirts or t-shirts or polos. And by the way, this chambr\u00e9 button-up is also from Lestrange. I've been wearing a few different pieces from this brand for a few years now and I really enjoy them. I will link to the pants that I showed you here in this video along with any active discount codes down below in the description. Okay, back to the video. Near as I can tell, there are six different methods that will allegedly help keep your shirt tucked in. The military tuck, the double tuck, pants with rubber waistband grips, magnet tucks, shirt stay belts, and shirt stay garters. We're going to put each of these methods to the test. Oh, and if you're really concerned about your shirt looking perfect all day, watch to the end because I have some additional thoughts about that. Okay, to the lab. The military tuck. The military tuck is a technique for tucking in your shirt to achieve a neat and tidy appearance. It's often used by military personnel to maintain a smart look, hence the name. I got that a little bit from ChatGPT. Here's how you can do it. With your shirt buttoned up and untucked, grab the excess fabric on either side and pull it toward the front, creating vertical folds on each side. With the excess fabric pulled toward the front, tuck your shirt into your pants at the sides, nice and tight so it doesn't come loose. Smooth out the front of your shirt and ensure it's tucked in evenly along the front of your waistband. This minimizes the amount of excess fabric around your waist, and it definitely looks cleaner, but does it actually prevent your shirt from coming untucked? Well, no. If you lift your arms up, your shirt will still pull out of your pants because physics. I like the military tuck. I do it pretty much every time that I tuck in my shirt, but it's not our magic solution that we're looking for. Onward, the double tuck. This only applies if you're also wearing an undershirt. I don't know about you, but I pretty much always wear an undershirt under my dress shirts or button-ups, usually like a ribbed tank top. Like most people, I used to tuck my undershirt and my button-up shirt into my pants over my underwear. With the double tuck, you tuck your undershirt into your underwear and then you tuck your shirt into your pants. Does this actually help? Well, no. Just like the military tuck, this doesn't really do anything to stop your shirt from coming untucked. But it is very comfortable, and I actually prefer it for that reason. So if you haven't tried it, give it a shot. Let's move on to the next method. Pants with rubber waistbands. Some pants come with a strip of rubber built into the inside of the waistband. If your pants don't have this feature, you can actually add it in or have a tailor do it for you. Many tailors carry this rubber grip tape, and they will sew it into the inside of your waistband. You can even buy this yourself. It's very affordable. I'll link to some down in the description. Most of my trousers and suit pants or dress pants are made to measure, and many custom pants come with this grip tape sewn into the waistband. Or at least they give you the option to add it in when you're ordering. So I've tested this quite a bit. But does it keep your shirt tucked in? No. I mean, it helps a little bit, but it's not a perfect solution. Like it'll probably help maintain a cleaner tuck a little bit throughout the day. But if you really reach your arms up above your head, your shirt is still going to pull out of your pants and come on tuck. It's better than nothing. And if you combine this with the military tuck and the double tuck, you'll probably be good to go in most situations. But we're only satisfied with the very best. So let's move on. Magnetic shirt stays. These gimmicky little gadgets cost a whopping $30 for what appears to be two silicone wrapped magnets. Talk about a tucking markup. They feel very as seen on TV, but do they actually work? Let's find out. The idea is to create these little stoppers on either side of your shirt that prevents it from pulling out of your pants. So you separate the magnets and then connect them on the inside and outside of your shirt just below the waistband. You do this on each side, then tuck in your shirt as usual. I didn't really think these were going to work. And big surprise, they did not. The magnets just popped out of my waistband when I lifted my arms up. These are kind of like the rubber grip tape in that they might help a little bit, but they're definitely not the perfect solution, especially if you move around a lot. In my opinion, these are not worth the price, not even close. For me, these are destined to become very expensive refrigerator magnets. They are very strong magnets. I'll give them that. But don't worry, we have two more methods to try and one of them actually works. Shirt stay belts. These are an alternative to traditional shirt stays. It's basically just an elastic rubber belt that cinches around your shirt just below the waistline. So it's hidden underneath your pants. Apparently, these are popular among law enforcement personnel and other people who wear uniforms every day. This was my first time trying a shirt stay belt. It's really easy to use. You just strap it around your waist over your shirt around or just below your waistline. Then you tuck in your shirt like normal and fasten your pants. I had kind of a mixed experience with this product. I tried different levels of tightness and different heights on my waist. It sort of worked, but not consistently. Like the magnetic stays, I found that the belt just came up with the shirt. So it didn't hold the shirt in place. It's like the whole rig just pulled up out of the pants. Now, I do think this would work better for guys who have bigger bellies. Like if you have sort of a natural barrier and you can strap this rubber belt around your waist below your belly, I think it might actually help. I don't exactly have washboard abs, but I also don't really have much of a gut. And this belt just didn't work well enough for me to want to use it regularly. Luckily, I've saved the best solution for last. Shirt tailgaters. These are also called shirt stays. They come in packs of two. The top attaches to your shirt tails and the bottom attaches to your socks. You can also get the kind that wraps around your leg if you don't wear socks or are wearing no show socks. I like the sock version because it kind of helps keep your socks pulled up as well. It creates this constant tension between your shirt and your socks. These have been around for a long time. They're commonly used in military uniforms. And after using them myself, I can understand why they just work. Of everything that I've tried, these are the only things that will actually pretty much keep your shirt tucked in even when you lift your arms up over your head. And yes, they feel a little funny at first, but you get used to them. They're also a little bit awkward to get on. I think if you use them every day, you'd probably get good at it, but it takes me a while. And I don't wear these every day. I mean, I really don't dress up very much anymore, but every time I suit up, like if I'm going to a wedding, I put these on. Now, understandably, you might have a couple of questions about these, so allow me to answer them. Are they comfortable? Yeah. I mean, if you wear these a lot, you're going to forget they're there. If you wear them occasionally, you'll be aware of their presence, but you won't be bothered by them. And note in this video, I kind of over tightened them just for the sake of the example. You don't have to wear them that tight. Do they work for shorter men? Yeah, I'm five-six, and I found that garters are not too long for me. Like I can get enough tension between my shirt and my sock. They cover a distance of about 14 to 24 inches. So if you're very short and you like wearing over-the-calf socks, these might not work for you, but I would try them out. What about, you know, the bathroom? Don't worry. You can use the bathroom without taking these off, sitting or standing. I'm not going to demonstrate because my grandma watches this channel. Grandma, if you're watching, be sure to subscribe and smash that like button. Finally, what will my partner think? Worst case, they think they're kind of silly. Best case, they're kind of into them. I wouldn't worry about this at all. A quick bonus tip, you should consider wearing longer and slightly looser shirts. Realistically, most guys aren't going to use any of these accessories. So I recommend just making sure that your dress shirts or the shirts that you're going to wear tucked in are long enough. Like they should probably be too long to wear untucked. If you have shirts that look good untucked, they're a bit shorter or they have more of a straight hem, and you try to tuck them in, when you lift your arms up, they're going to come all the way untucked in certain places, like at the sides, and this is just sloppy. You should also avoid super slim fit shirts. It's actually harder to get like a nice clean looking tuck that stays in place all day with a very slim fit shirt. In fact, if a shirt fits properly, like if it's long enough and just gently fitted, not too slim, you can create some wiggle room by pulling it out a little when you tuck it in. This way, there's some slack built in that lets you move your arms up and down throughout the day. I'm not saying you'll never need to run to the bathroom and clean up your tuck, but it'll require less maintenance and be more comfortable than wearing a super slim fit shirt. So wrapping up, if you want a super clean tuck that just stays in place all day, really the only good solution is shirts stays. And I'm talking about the traditional shirt tailgaters, not the magnet ones, not the rubber belt. I like the ones that attach to your socks, they just work. All these other things, save your money. But please know, it's not that serious. This isn't that big of a deal. I remember I used to be so nitpicky about my appearance, especially when I worked in like a business casual office setting. It really bothered me if I didn't have like a nice clean tuck all day, if my pants weren't the perfect length for whatever shoes I was wearing, you know, if my sleeves were like an inch too long. And maybe I'm just getting older now, but I just don't think it matters that much. Like no one cares about your outfits. I mean, think about it. Can you remember what anybody at work was wearing yesterday? No, and they can't remember what you were wearing either. I mean, I think if you care at all, if you put a little bit of effort into your appearance, which if you're watching this video, it means that you do care, then you're probably already perceived as a well dressed guy. And that's enough. So don't overthink it. You look great. If you have any questions about anything we covered today, let me know down in the comment section. Thank you again to Lestrange for supporting the channel. I will link to them down below in the description. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

I did something many watch enthusiasts would consider sacrilege. I had my vintage Rolex Datejust totally refurbished including a new dial and bracelet. Many collectors believe that as long as a watch is still ticking and keeping good time, you shouldn't mess with it. Like, don't get the scratches buffed out, don't change the dial or the hands even if they're tarnished. Patina is good. Overpolishing is bad. Swapping in new parts will ruin your vintage watch. I disagree. I don't see a point in preserving old stuff just for the aesthetic. I mean, I like Patina. I can appreciate someone's Rod Denim progress pics, but I don't want to actually wear their jeans. I want to create my own sick fades. Actually, I don't even want to do that. Rod Denim is way too much work. What I'm saying is to me, Patina is special because it's personal. But why am I talking about this? My first luxury watch and actually the only luxury watch that I own right now was a Rolex Datejust 1603.0. It was manufactured in 1984, making it just a few months older than me. I bought this watch from my friend Christian from Theo & Harris. He gave me a very good deal and frankly, I only went vintage because it's what I could afford. It was like half the price of a brand new Datejust. Now, this five-digit reference was keeping perfect time, but it was aged. I mean, it looked like a 30-plus year old watch that had actually been worn. And I didn't mind the signs of wear, but I also didn't buy it for the vintage look. I did like the somewhat rare toped dial with the white lettering. I found the jangly, stretched out jubilee bracelet to be comfy on my wrist. But after wearing it a lot for over five years, it had gathered even more scratches and a big ding on the crystal. And the bracelet was even looser to the point where I didn't really trust it to stay on. It still kept good time, but I was afraid to get it wet. You know, it hadn't been pressure tested in a while. And for all of those reasons, I found myself wearing it less often. I just didn't want to damage it or lose it. I figured it was time for a checkup. You know, at the very least, I wanted to make sure that the oyster case was still watertight. Now, I knew that I could go to a local watch repair shop and probably get this done for like five or six hundred dollars. They'd clean up the movement and pressure test it. But I wanted to know what a proper Rolex servicing would look like, how much it would cost, and how long it would take, and what they would actually do. So, I went to the closest authorized dealer and I had it inspected. Now, at this point in the video, you're probably wondering, is this guy really just going to keep blabbering on and not take the watch out of the bag? I know. I get it. You want to see the watch. I want to see the watch. But I also need to keep my retention rate up. Views have been down if I'm honest with you and I have mouths to feed. But whatever, I'll take the watch out of the bag right after a word from today's sponsor. Just kidding. No sponsor. Let's look at the watch. Okay. Now that we got the watch out, I'll continue my story. So, the authorized dealer sent this Datejust to their Rolex facility and they came back with a laundry list of problems, including the crystal is scratched, the bezel is scratched and shows impact damage, the case body is scratched, dented and worn, the case back is scratched, deformed and worn. The crown is worn and shows impact damage. The bracelet is worn beyond practical use. Metal is worn away on links and pins, especially on end links. Movement is dirty. Movement lubrication is dry. Movement has rough winding. Automatic module lubrication is dry and dirty. Dialuminescent is discolored and shows water damage. And to just hammer the point home, they ended with the bracelet is dangerously worn and not secure and therefore will not be reattached. Not gonna lie, when I was reading this, I almost felt a little embarrassed, like a negligent father or something. Anyway, Rolex service is all or nothing. So, you can either have them do everything they suggested or they won't service your watch. In other words, they don't offer their recommendations a la carte. Like if they say you need a new bracelet dial and the movement repaired, you can't just ask them to repair the movement. So, when they came back with their $2,800 list of recommendations, I had a choice to make. You can either pony up and get this watch restored to Rolex standards, including a new dial, handset and bracelet, or just take it somewhere else and get the movement service for like $500. And this is where the whole vintage patina debate comes in. You know, many watch knobs, sorry, enthusiasts would say that you shouldn't touch any of the components that you don't have to. So, get the movement service, get it pressure tested, but don't swap the dial or bracelet or handset. Preserve that vintage patina. But not me. I decided to go big and let Rolex do their thing, even if it meant having to get a new dial, which I'll talk about in a minute. And I'll tell you why I did this, but please know, I'm not trying to convince anybody of the right or wrong way to maintain their watch. This is just what I decided. I'm just talking through my thought process in case it's helpful for anybody else in a similar situation. So, why did I pay a premium for an official Rolex service center? Two reasons. I guess I could take it off this little pad here. One, this is a Forever watch. I'm going to have this watch, hopefully if I don't lose it, until I die. And hopefully I'll pass it down to someone else who will enjoy wearing it as much as I have. So, I want it to be as durable as possible and new components are just more durable. Plus, I'll only need this type of thorough servicing, maybe one more time. This watch will probably never need a new bracelet or dial ever again. And reason number two, this was a chance to upgrade one key component that I think would make me want to wear this watch more often. And that's the bracelet. I just dress much more casually than I did five plus years ago when I bought this watch. And I kind of found the Jubilee to be a bit too flashy for everyday wear. Like if I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt and Chocos dropping my daughter off at daycare, the Jubilee always just felt a little dressy. Plus, I've always loved Rolex's oyster bracelets. They're more casual and sporty than the Jubilee, but they're every bit as comfortable in my opinion. I've worn other Rolex's with the oyster bracelet and I really enjoyed them. So, I figured if I'm buying a new bracelet as part of this service package, I might as well get the one I want. And I know that some Rolex purists will say that an oyster bracelet should only be paired with a smooth bezel and that Jubilee bracelets look best with fluted bezels. But you know, I've seen so many variations, including oyster with fluted, Jubilee with smooth. And I think they all look pretty cool. This is one of those subjective details that watch nerds will debate until the cows come home, but I say just do whatever you like. Also, this watch doesn't have the white gold fluted bezel. It's actually a steel engine turned bezel, which they don't make anymore. I think it's a bit more industrial and sporty than the fluted bezel. I've also seen examples of this exact bezel paired with the oyster bracelet and I thought they looked great. Plus, I still have the Jubilee bracelet. So, if I want to, I could get that restored and then wear that one too. Now, I knew that making these big changes would mean that I kind of had a different watch. It's a more modern watch, but the heart of it, the movement and the oyster case are the same. And it would still cost way less than buying another watch. I mean, in some ways, this is like getting a new Datejust for like under $3,000. So with all that said, here's how it went. If you're swapping in new components like the dial of bracelet, Rolex will let you choose styles, but you have to choose something that is period appropriate. So you can't put like a 2024 dial or bracelet on a 1980s Datejust. If that same toped dial was available, I definitely would have chose that color. I really loved that color, but it wasn't. And so Rolex suggested replacing it with a silver one, very common color for vintage and modern Datejusts. But one thing I really liked about that toped dial is it was sort of uncommon. Like to me, the silver just felt a little too generic. So I asked what my options were and they let me choose from these dials. I cross-checked this with other service providers and it does seem like these really are your only choices if you're getting a new dial on a five-digit Datejust. Of course, you could buy your own dial and have it replaced somewhere else, but I wanted to make sure I was getting authentic parts. I'm not going to lie. This was a tough choice. I considered white, black, maybe even blue. But in the end, I went with this slate gray for a few reasons. First, it's just the closest in value to the old toped dial that I had. It still has the white lettering, which I think is really cool. It's sort of minimal and casual with the small dash minute markers around the outside as opposed to the more dressy Roman numerals that you see on a lot of Datejusts dials. And I sort of like the coffin shape of the hour indexes. Like they're these little pedestals that have a bit more heft than the more common matchstick indexes. I think they look really cool with the steel engine-turned bezel. They kind of match that style. And also, with the way they catch light, they're visible from like any angle. And finally, I just like the gray color. It's a little bit darker than the toped dial I had, but it's still kind of a medium value in between white and black. I also like the sunburst finish. It kind of changes depending on what lighting scenario you're in. And I think that keeps a watch interesting as opposed to a matte color dial. Plus, this dial actually has working loom, which you don't get on all Datejusts dials. Yeah, it's not as bright or powerful as what you get on a modern sport watch, but it's still kind of cool and practical to have a bit of glow on a vintage watch. So I chose that dial and bracelet. I put down my deposit. I think it was about $800. And I donned my Casio F105 for 10 weeks, waiting patiently. I actually really enjoyed wearing this little Casio. It's sort of a more practical version of the legendary F91W because unlike the 91, this has a full backlight. And it's only like $5 more expensive than the 91. I mean, this little watch really does it all. I actually find myself using the stopwatch just to time random stuff. And I can just hand this to my nine month old if she needs a distraction. Will she eat it? Who cares? And let's be honest, digital watches are just easier to read. I don't care what anybody says. This thing is super comfy on the wrist. It's like a bracelet. It just disappears. Anyway, we're getting a bit off topic. Let's get back to the Datejust. So I finally got the call saying that this watch was back from the spa. The next day happened to be Father's Day. My wife watched the kids while I went and got a haircut and then went and picked up this watch. It was actually a really fantastic day. Thanks wife. That afternoon we took the kids to the pool and I somewhat nervously wore this into the pool and the hot tub. I had to do it. I had to get it over with. I knew that if I took it off, I would just baby this watch forever. I'm happy to report that no water made its way into the case. I know a lot of people don't wear their luxury watches into the pool or hot tub, especially a vintage one. You know, water, heat and chlorine probably aren't great for watches. But that ain't me. I don't want to wear a watch that has to be babyed. This is a Rolex after all. It has an oyster case. It was literally built to handle submersion and impact and temperature. And yeah, I'll get it pressure tested every few years. But until then, I'm going to wear it as I live my life. It's almost too pristine right now. You know, it's like a pair of fresh white sneakers. A little too squeaky clean. I need to scratch it up a little bit just to get that out of the way. And that's the point. I'm looking to create my own patina on this watch. And when I eventually give it to one of my daughters if they want it, they'll know that every scratch and ding came from me living my life and working and hanging out spending time with them. And hey, if they want to get it serviced and replace the dial or the bracelet, that's fine with me. It'll be their turn to create their own patina, their own experiences. Probably put this on at this point now that we're wrapping things up. That's my update. If you have any questions about getting your Rolex serviced or this watch or really anything else, let me know down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish. Be cool."

        "transcript": " What does this tiny knife and these underwear and whatever this is have in common? They all cost less than $50 and made my life better. And that's what this video is all about. So let's just get into it, starting with clothing. First up, a braided belt. This is the most versatile type of belt. It's micro-adjustable. It goes with any casual outfit and it lasts forever. Plus, many braided belts these days have a bit of stretch built in. If you buy one in tan or navy or gray, you can wear it with pretty much any pair of pants. It also goes with any shoes and any other accessories. If you get yourself a braided belt and maybe one leather belt, that's all the belt you'll ever need. Next up, Uniclo subpoena cotton t-shirts. I still struggle to find a t-shirt that works better for my build and that offers better value for the money than the Uniclo subpoena cotton crew neck tee. This is a size extra small, but I can wear a small too. This was like $20, I think now they're 25, but they're often on sale. This one is like four or five years old and I still wear it. It's 100% pima cotton. It shrinks a little bit, but not too much. You could throw them in the dryer or if you want them to last a little longer, air dry them. It's my go-to t-shirt, but of course Uniclo makes a bunch of different t-shirt styles. I made a video comparing all of them, so go check that out. Premium quality underwear. If you're used to paying $15 for a multi-pack of boxers, then like $15 or $20 for one pair might seem expensive. And yeah, it's pricey for underwear, but the actual dollar amount isn't that much. It's like one fancy cocktail or three lattes or one visit to an airport Panera. Plus the cost per wear is still very low and you're gonna be happier every day when you put them on and your partner will be happier every night if you catch my meaning. I do think that there are diminishing returns. Like I don't think that a $30 pair of underwear is that much better than a $20 pair, but there are many great brands in the $20 to $30 range and I will link to a few of my favorites in the description. Next up, good matching hangers. Your hanger collection might look like this. You know, you have some from the dry cleaners and then some plastic ones left over from college and then, you know, a couple of nicer ones. But a nice set of good matching wooden hangers is just so satisfying. At the very least, you wanna avoid using those wire hangers that you get from the dry cleaners. They're really bad for your clothes. Upgrade to plastic or better yet, wood. For your jackets and coats, you can get those thicker wooden hangers with the curved shoulders. You can get some clip style hangers for your pants. For everything else, I pretty much just use these basic wooden hangers and they're not even that much more expensive than the plastic ones. There's something about having matching hangers and the right hanger style for each type of garment. It's just so easy on the eyes, you know? I could be a little OCD. It does run in my family on my maternal grandmother's side. I should probably talk to somebody about that. Speaking of which, I wanna introduce today's sponsor, BetterHelp. As a psychology major, I've always been a firm believer in the power of therapy, but it wasn't until I became a parent that I realized how valuable it could be for me personally. The dream's isn't into parenthood, it is a whirlwind. I found myself struggling with the demands of raising two young children and also trying to maintain my own health and well-being. Going from no kids to one kid was difficult, but when the second kid arrived, it was like my world was turned upside down. Like suddenly, I had this full-time 24-7 job on top of my regular work and all the responsibility and worry that comes with being a parent can be overwhelming. I found myself with much less time for the things that used to recharge my batteries like exercise or hobbies or honestly, just relaxing and doing nothing. You know, date nights become a rare luxury. Like my wife and I will often have to cancel or reschedule because a kid is sick or we can't find a babysitter. Basically, it's just easy to feel like you're running on empty with no time to recharge your batteries and honestly, I think society kind of downplays how hard it is to become a parent. And this is especially true for those of us who have kids a little later in life after we've kind of already established our ideal lifestyles. And that's where therapy comes in. Speaking with a therapist about managing my energy and mood, balancing the responsibility with self-care and also just accepting this new chapter of life could be hugely beneficial. Now I've had fine therapist on my to-do list for like well over a year, but it's hard to actually take time to find somebody with availability and drive to the appointment and then like, what if it's not a good fit? You gotta start the process all over again. And that's why I'm excited to tell you about BetterHelp. BetterHelp is an online therapy platform that makes getting the supports you need more accessible and convenient than ever.

Go to betterhelp.com slash Brock McGough or select Brock McGough at signup to get a special discount off your first month of therapy. All right, let's talk about some affordable purchases for the home. First up, nightlights. Yeah, nightlights, like the ones for little kids' bedrooms. These things are so underrated. I bought a four pack of these little light sensing LED ones, which came out to less than $4 per light. You plug them in and they come on automatically when it gets dark. I put them in the bathrooms and hallways, one in the kitchen, so there's just like a dim ambient light at nighttime. It adds a pleasant ambient feel to your home and it also makes those nighttime trips to the bathroom or to your kids' rooms much safer. A longer phone charger. Honestly, I kind of thought wireless charging would be a bit more advanced by now. Like why can't we just send the electricity through the air? And why don't we have hoverboards? I was lied to. The next best thing is longer charging cables. Why buy a three foot charger for your phone when you can get a six foot one? You know that feeling when you like have your phone plugged in and you're sitting on the couch and you can't quite get it to where you want because the charger is too short? Just get a longer cable. You should have at least one really long phone charger in your home. Flat extension cords. You only plug something in behind a piece of furniture and you can't really push the furniture all the way up against the wall anymore because you feel like you're gonna damage the cord? Yeah, I hate that. That's why these extension cords with the flat plugs makes so much sense. I don't even know why regular ones exist anymore. Bonus points if you get the kind that swivels too. See-through storage bins. Unless you live somewhere like Southern California where the weather never changes, chances are you probably have some clothes that you only wear during fall and winter and then other clothes that you wear during spring and summer. I like to store unused clothing, footwear, and accessories in clear plastic bins that slide right under the bed. This is unused space and honestly, they totally disappear. Like you can't even see them when you're standing up looking at the bed. They don't add any visual or mental clutter to your life. Plus, if you get the clear ones, you can easily see what's inside each bin. I recommend the kind of long, flat ones because you can stack them up if your bed is high enough. These things are great. Okay, moving on to everyday carry. This is the Casio F105 and I think everybody should have at least one cheap digital watch. If you're not really into watches, this can be your only watch. Even if you're into collecting or higher end watches, this can be your beater. It's cheap. A lot of these say that they're water resistant, but in my experience, they're pretty much waterproof. It's small, it's lightweight, it's battery powered, so it's always powered up, it's always accurate. If something happens to it, it's not a huge deal because it was only like $22. For your watch geeks, the 105 is better than the 91W because it has a full backlight, not that weak little corner light that the 91 has. Highly recommended, a tiny knife. I never carry like a big EDC knife because I never need one and I feel like it just takes up a lot of space in my pocket. I mean, even like these knives from Wesson and Kershaw, like they're cool, I keep them in my desk, I'll use them to open packages for unboxing videos and stuff, but I won't actually carry them in my pocket. But a tiny knife, especially one that fits on your key chain, that just makes sense. I mostly use it like just for opening packages, cutting the occasional loose thread or cutting athletic tape and other minor laceration related tasks. This Spyderco bug is the smallest one that I've found. It's pretty cheap and it's served me well for years. Great little knife. Similarly, a small flashlight comes in very handy. I know that our phones have flashlights and for quick tasks, they work just fine, but I found myself using like a dedicated flashlight somewhat often. If you get one like this, like you can clip it onto your hat or your shirt or a stroller. So if I'm going for a nighttime walk, I'll take this along. Plus this one just takes a AAA battery so it lasts forever. You never have to recharge it. It's way brighter than the flashlight on your phone. It's also just really durable. You can drop it, you can get it wet. Actually, I don't know if you can get this wet. I think you can. Anyway, in a world where our phone kind of does everything but not everything well, I find it's kind of nice to have a dedicated tool like this little flashlight. Last up in this category, a compact umbrella. When it comes to umbrellas, I think that portability trumps the size because even if you have a really big umbrella, it's still kind of a pain to fit more than one person under it. I like a small portable but high quality umbrella. You don't want a cheap flimsy one that's going to turn inside out when the wind picks up. I keep this totes Titan compact umbrella in my car so I'm never caught without it if an unexpected storm comes in. Bad luck. All right, moving on to beauty. Sorry, grooming and electric toothbrush. I was late to the electric toothbrush game but now that I've been using one for a few years, I could never go back. The main benefit of an electric toothbrush, according to data, is that when you use one, you tend to brush your teeth for longer. That's because most of them have a two minute timer built in. With a manual toothbrush, almost no one actually brushes for a full two minutes. Given that electric toothbrushes are so affordable now, you can get a good one for like 20 or 30 bucks. There's no reason not to use one. On a related note, pick style flossers. I can never get into the habit of flossing every night mostly because I don't like using the string floss. Once I switch to the pick style flossers, the habit stuck. I floss every single night, no exceptions, even when I'm traveling. And I know these aren't as effective as the string floss but it's way better than just not flossing. Also with the right technique, they do work really well. I've talked to dentist and hygienist about this. Since switching to an electric toothbrush, using these flossers and also using a fluoride mouthwash, I just don't get cavities anymore and I used to get them all the time. An electric shaver. Speaking of efficient grooming, I switched to an electric shaver a few years ago and haven't looked back. I forgot to shave this morning. Little scruffy, little unkempt looking, probably not the best person to be promoting the electric shaver right now but the show must go on. Here's the thing, with the electric shaver, your shave is not gonna be as close so you have to shave more often but it is so quick and easy and I also find the electric shaver to be pretty gentle on my skin. And you don't need to buy a $200 fancy one. You can get a really nice one for under $50. I've been using the same one for like, I wanna say five or six years now and it works just fine. I'll drop a couple links in the description. Adapoline gel. Now, I made a whole video about the benefits of using topical retinoids so I recommend checking that out if you're not happy with how your skin looks. Long story short, this $10 tube of Adapoline gel has had a bigger impact on my skin than any other skincare product I've ever tried. I'm talking clearer, younger looking skin, especially if you're prone to acne breakouts. I used to get pretty bad acne and I just don't anymore. If you don't have acne, you can just try a regular retinol cream. You don't need the Adapoline gel but either way, you don't have to get like the Fanta Designer brands. You can just get the generic retinol or Adapoline and it works. High quality SPF moisturizer or sunscreen. Living in Southern Arizona, I wear sunscreen at least on my face pretty much every day. Normal sunscreen is like thick and greasy. The stronger zinc stuff is usually overkill unless I'm like going to the pool. So most days I'm using a moisturizer with a little bit of SPF built in. I'll link to some of my favorite brands in the description. You know, a high quality SPF moisturizer might run you $15. But it's doing double duty. It's moisturizing your skin and giving you enough sun protection to be out there for a little while. Like I said, if you're gonna be out there all day, use something stronger. But this is money well spent. A glass nail file. Those little metal nail files kind of suck. And the cardboard ones just don't last very long. Spend like $7 to upgrade to a glass nail file. They feel way better. They're just smoother and more effective and they last forever. They don't get dull. They don't get rusty or bent out of shape. Last up in this category, premium deodorant. I never thought I'd spend $22 on a stick of deodorant, but here we are. This Jack Black Pip Boss deodorant is the best I found. I actually also included this in my expensive purchases that are worth the money video. This stuff is strong, but it's not irritating. It smells great and it lasts all day. Don't get me wrong. I'm not above wearing Old Spice Swagger. But this stuff is excellent if you're looking for the upgrade. Moving on to feet, orthotic insoles. This is actually another product that I included in the expensive purchases video because they are kind of expensive. Like if you spend $40 or $50 on a pair of insoles, you're like, yeah, that could just go to a new pair of shoes. But these are a great way to get more out of the shoes that you already own. Like especially if you have a pair of shoes that used to be comfortable, but maybe they're not great anymore. Maybe they change or your feet change. Before you replace them, try insoles. Recently, I've made a couple of videos about trying to find comfortable shoes so you can go check those out. And I will keep testing out new shoe brands to try to find comfortable and stylish enough options. But I also use these orthotic insoles. I've tried a bunch. I like these power steps. I also like the Superfeet medium arch cushion insoles. But honestly, I recommend going to a store and trying out a bunch of them because all of our feet are different and it's pretty subjective. Either way, I do think it's worth spending $30 or $40 to ease pain and avoid long-term health issues. In the same vein, house slippers. I try not to wear shoes inside, at least on the carpet, but I do like a little bit of cushion underfoot. I don't really like walking around in bare feet, especially on like hard tile flooring. And during the cooler months, I like a bit of extra warmth. House slippers, take care of all that. These are actually from Geese Wine. These are not under $50. These are like high-end house slippers, but there are so many options in the more affordable price range. I'll link to a few of my favorites in the description. But if you don't have a pair of house slippers, I highly recommend them. Last up in this category, good socks. It's easy to skimp on socks. Like why not just buy multi-packs of whatever cheap cotton socks are on sale? But once you wear high-quality socks, especially wool, it's hard to go back. I like dedicated brands like Smartwool and Bombas, Features, Swiftwik, DarnTuff. You know, some of these brands like DarnTuff even have lifetime warranties on socks. You know, in my opinion, towards spending a few more dollars on high-quality socks that will be more comfortable and last a lot longer. Okay, and last category is Travel slash, et cetera. This Contigo water bottle. Hydroflask is so overrated. Stanley, don't even get me started. I mean, the standard Hydroflask model, you can't even use it with one hand. You have to like unscrew the top. It's just a plastic and metal cylinder. Like why does it cost $50? Get yourself a Contigo. These are the most functional water bottles I've found. Actually, my wife found them and she converted me. You can use them with one hand. You can close the top so they won't spill. Once you open the top, you have to push the button to open the seal. So it still won't spill until you push the button. If you're traveling, you can lock it so you can't push the button, so it definitely won't spill. They have a little carrying handle. You could use a carabiner. They're slim enough to put in your backpack. And they cost like half as much as a Hydroflask Contigo. TSA Pre-Check. Okay, technically it costs $78. So it's over 50, but that's for five years. So that comes out to like $16 a year. And in my opinion, even if you only fly occasionally, that's worth it. I mean, if you fly three times a year, that comes out to $5 a flight. I would pay $5 to avoid waiting in line for a half hour, wouldn't you? You're worth it. I also like Clear, which lets you skip the Pre-Check line. But I think if you could only choose one, Pre-Check is the way to go. A luggage scale. This is like $9. And it'll mean that you never have to pay for an overweight bag or do that awkward repacking at the check and counter ever again. I actually never really used one of these until we started flying with kids, which means we just had to pack a bunch of extra stuff. All of a sudden it was very easy to hit that weight limit for checked luggage. If you have one of these, you can weigh your luggage at home so there won't be any surprises at the airport. Okay, and last but definitely not least, two books. Number one is the Simple Path to Wealth. And number two is the Psychology of Money. This video is about affordable products. It's about saving money or being frugal, but also improving your life. These are the only two books that you ever have to read about personal finance. If you read both of these books, you will know more about money than 99% of the population. You'll know how much you have, how much you need, how to get rid of debt, how much you can comfortably spend each month, and how much you have to save to be okay for retirement. And you'll also just feel less anxious about money. It's easy to bury your head in the sand when it comes to personal finance and wealth management, but I promise if you spend 10 or 20 bucks on both of these books, they'll be some of the best investments you've ever made. All right, wrapping up, what did I miss? I wanna know your number one recent purchase under $50. So let me know in the comments section.

        "transcript": " Many jobs come with perks. Barista's get fancy lattes on the house whenever they want. Flight attendants can fly for free anywhere in the world. Car salesmen get to collect fat commissions without really doing anything. The coolest perk of my job making YouTube videos is all of the free stuff. Now many influencers for lack of a better word are gonna downplay this. But I like to keep it real, so here's the deal. If you have a decent sized audience on YouTube or social media, you're gonna get a lot of free samples from brands, like a lot. I get emails from brands every single day, and most of them don't really have any interest in sponsoring a video, but they do wanna send a sample. And it's awesome, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's the coolest perk of any job that I've ever had. Granted, you can't pay your rent with cologne or wallets, but still, it's pretty fun to have Christmas every week. Of course these brands are sending samples to YouTubers because they hope that they'll get some organic or unpaid coverage, and a lot of the stuff that I receive does show up in videos. But I don't have time to make videos about everything, and a lot of these things don't really warrant like a full dedicated video review. So I wanted to make this video just to show you some of the stuff that I've gotten the last few months, just to kind of show these brands some love, and also maybe expose you to some new brands and gear that you might like. Let's start with this. This is the Apex 3.0 backpack from Troubadour Goods. It's a premium quality, waterproof bag, has tons of storage, a lot of travel-friendly options, like little hidden compartments where you can hide your valuables. It's pretty big, it can accommodate a 17 inch laptop. They actually make a smaller compact version of this backpack, which I'd kind of prefer. But I did take this as a personal item on a cross-country flight recently, sort of as like a snack slash diaper bag, remnants of that trip, and it performed well. I've actually tested quite a few backpacks. This one feels very well made, feels like it would go the distance, super comfortable to carry, lightweight, and I think Troubadour has done a great job with it. Like I said, it's a little large for my everyday needs. I'd probably go for the compact version. Let's look inside. Okay, moving on. Here are two tech pouches from two different brands. They serve the same function, but have completely different aesthetics. This one is from Harbor London. It's a leather goods and accessories brand based out of, you guessed it, the UK. It is made in Spain from full grain leather. Like other Harbor London products that I've tried, this one is very soft out of the box, just very plush feeling, it doesn't need any breaking in. It has plenty of organization built in, including this magnetic key chain that is very satisfying to attach and detach. But it's not over the top, and I think this is great for anybody that wants to carry a few pieces of gear, like a charger, maybe your AirPods, a couple cables, maybe a hard drive. It would be good for travel too, like if you wanted to keep all your tech stuff separate in your suitcase. And this other one is from an Australian brand called Orbit Key that's mostly known for its key organizers. This one is a bit more involved. It has a lot of different compartments, a lot of internal organization going on. It even has this like two in one structure with this little separate pencil pouch. This one is made from recycled polyester that's water resistant and feels pretty tough like could take a beating, which let's be honest, this isn't gonna take a beating. You're gonna put it in your backpack and take it to Starbucks. Compared to the Harbor London pouch, this one has a lot going on. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that when I see this much like internal structure or organization, I'm never really sure what to put in all these separate compartments. It's almost like you go looking for stuff to put in these compartments, even though you just don't have that much stuff. That said, it is pretty customizable with this two in one design. And for a certain type of person, it's probably perfect. I picture like a super organized graphic designer or architect, someone who's got like a specced out iPad Pro and a very specific and possibly high quality set of pens and pencils. For me, I'd probably only ever use 50% of this pouch's organizational potential. I probably would never really use this little pencil case, but let's just take a look inside. Wait a minute. Oh, is this a bolt action titanium pen from Bastion? I'm not really a pen guy. I remember in middle school, I pretty much got straight A's except for one class, penmanship, which is handwriting. They probably don't even have that class anymore. And you know, as a lefty, my handwriting has always sucked, especially now so I don't really use it. But I still appreciate a finely crafted buy it for life quality product. And this slim titanium pen from Bastion is just that. The bolt action is very satisfying. It's pretty stiff so you can really feel the tension. You can do it quietly or you can really let it click. I've actually mostly been using this as like a fidget device, but I've signed a few checks too, if you know what I mean. You know, rent, taxes, and this little guy smooths his butter. All right, let's see what else we got here. Two wallets, one of them is okay. And the other one is my new favorite wallet. Can you guess which is which? Well, I guess one is still in the box. That kind of gives it away. Okay, so this first one is made from NVST, which I believe mostly sells luggage, but they wanted to send over a sample of their wallets. These are Alcantara wallets, so that kind of synthetic suede material. You'll see that a lot of the times actually in cars, like higher end luxury cars, that's what that is. And then the rest is vegan leather. Now I'm somewhat of a wallet, aficionado, connoisseur, snob. I'm a wallet snob. I really am particular about which wallets I carry. I've tried a bunch of them, and so this review is gonna sound a little critical. But in my opinion, a great wallet is compact. It's no bigger than it needs to be, and it's easy to use, ideally with one hand. These wallets have plenty of capacity. They open up, they got a little ID slot, some internal slots, some external slots, at least on one side, but this snap button closure doesn't really make sense to me. You can't really use it with one hand, and this is gonna be the least durable part of the wallet. This thing is gonna fall apart before anything else does. It just kind of feels like an extra step to get your cards or cash out. Also, vegan leather is really just plastic. You know, at this price, I'd rather just have real leather. Keep in mind, leather used for things like wallets is pretty much always a byproduct of the meat industry, so it's not like people are killing cows to make wallets. And then when you have vegan leather, that might sound good, but it really is just synthetic. You know, it's oil-based, it's basically plastic. So personally, given the choice, I'll take real leather over vegan leather. So this one is a pass for me, but like I said, I'm a tough customer when it comes to wallets. I'm sure many people would like this. This one, however, is my new favorite wallet. It is from Reform Carry, a German brand that's hyper-focused on simplicity, functionality, and durability. That's exactly what I look for in a wallet. This is their card holder, which is technically made from synthetic rubber, but it feels dry and slightly textured, almost like nylon. It's an incredibly slim wallet with one of the best layouts that I've ever seen. And even though it's not leather, it still feels premium in the hand. I love that there's no visible branding on the outside that is such a breath of fresh air. I wish more brands would do this. But my favorite part about this wallet is this magnetic closure. It's so satisfying to use, and you just get the sense that nothing is gonna fall out. It's a departure from my normal card holder format because technically this is a folding wallet, but it's still so low profile, and I've been carrying it every day for a couple months. I really love it, so well done Reform. Next up is this little ring. It's the Ultra Human Air. I've worn an Aura ring on and off for the past few years. Overall, I really like it. I feel like it does kind of confirm a lot of stuff that you already know, like it takes a while to recover from a hard workout, and alcohol affects your sleep. But I still like the idea of wearing a fitness tracker. My main gripe with the Aura ring is it's just kind of bulky, and you sort of feel the sensors poking into your finger. Also, the battery life on this isn't what it used to be. At this point, 30% charge means that it won't last through the night. Plus, Aura charges a monthly subscription fee to use their app now. I had heard that the Ultra Human Air was a bit lower profile than Aura, plus this newer company doesn't charge a subscription fee to use their app. So when they offered to send a sample, I had to say yes. I've been wearing this one for a few weeks, and I can confirm it's more comfortable than the Aura ring. It is slightly lower profile, but I think the comfort is mostly due to the shape of the sensors. They just don't poke into your fingers as much. I also think it looks a little better than the Aura ring, but the differences are subtle. I'd like to see both of these brands make different colors, like a lighter color ring, that would kind of not stand out so much. But the thing is neither of these rings are like a wedding band. Like they are just thick, bulky rings. And like I would never wear a ring like this as a piece of jewelry. I'm very aware that I'm wearing it. And for that reason, Aura Ultra Human, I'm mostly using it at night as a sleep tracker. I'm not wearing it all day. The Ultra Human app is similar to Aura. I'd say the UX is maybe slightly less refined. This is a much newer company. Aura has had years and lots of feedback to kind of refine their app. The Ultra Human app also comes with like some meditation and breath work. And it is kind of cool doing these breath work exercises while you're wearing the ring, and you can like watch your heart rate change in real time. Overall, I'd say if you're interested in a ring style tracker and you're considering the Aura ring, I would definitely strongly consider Ultra Human Air instead. Creed Aventus. Now, I'm no fragrance head. And to be honest, I don't know if I'd ever spend $500 on a bottle of Cologne. But when Creed's PR team reached out and offered to send a bottle, of course I had to accept. What am I, a dummy? Even I know about Aventus, which is one of the most legendary men's fragrances. And I'm not gonna lie, it lives up to the hype. The packaging is also very cool. It's like just a very unique unboxing experience. And you know, at this price, that kind of makes sense. It's actually not in here. I have it at home. I'll try to get some B-roll for the video, but yeah, I really like it. And the actual scent is amazing. I could tell you the top notes and all that, but to be honest, I've never really understood any of that. To me, this is a complicated fragrance. It seems to morph from clean and fresh to something a bit more classic. Much like with watches, I kind of prefer to be a one fragrance kind of guy, and you need something that you're not gonna get tired of. And so far, I am not tired of this. All right, let's talk Huckberry. So Huckberry, of course, sells a lot of men's clothing and shoes, but they also have a deep catalog of home goods and decor, office wear, EDC desk accessories. My friends at Huckberry sent over a few items for the office, including this Yamazaki wall clock, this native union wireless charger, and this Edison light stick. I figured the wall clock could be part of my backdrop, which is very much a work in progress, but I think it's coming together. Also, like having a wall clock, there's something kind of nostalgic or analog about it. It kind of feels like a middle school or high school classroom. This light stick is pretty cool too. I think my kids are old enough to camp in the backyard. This is gonna be a big hit in the tent, but right now I figured it could just kind of be like a set piece in the background here. And then there's this two-in-one charger from Native Union. It's actually perfect for my setup, which is like iPhone and AirPods Pro. You can put the phone on the MagSafe charger and then the AirPods on the base, and they'll both charge at the same time. It's a pretty slick looking charger, and it kind of does double duty. It keeps your phone where you can see it in a hands-free sort of way. Definitely an upgrade to my desk setup. Hookberry also sent over this limited edition Ironman Flix Reissue. It's a collaboration they did with Timex. It's a very cool watch. I kind of have a soft spot for these like retro, somewhat affordable digital watches. They remind me of the watches I always wanted to buy when I would go to a department store with my mom back in the day, you know, back to school shopping. You know, those watches that were in like those plastic display racks, mostly from Casio and Timex. This one is for runners, hence the name. So it has a 100 lap timer, 100 meters water resistance, and plenty of shock resistance. The oversized buttons are very easy to press, which makes sense, like if you were actually doing a triathlon in this. The Indiglo makes nighttime visibility a breeze. And listen, I don't run triathlons or biathlons or even athlons, but this is still a cool looking watch. It's a little large on my wrist, but it's very light and it doesn't feel like a big watch. Next up, we have this Sandmark Action Gear tripod. This is actually a mobile tripod. So it's made to be used with your phone or mobile device. I'd heard about this brand, but I hadn't actually tried them until they sent over this Pro edition of their iPhone tripod. It's a full size tripod that is supposedly made for smartphones, but honestly, it seems pretty heavy duty. I'm pretty sure you could use this with any kind of camera. It does come with a phone mount. So it's ready to use with your phone. It also has an Arca Swiss plate. So this is kind of like industry standard on nicer tripods. So you could use this with really any of your other gear. And it has a ball head, which makes it easy to switch between portrait and landscape mode. So yeah, this thing feels really nice, mostly metal components. It might be all metal actually. And it just feels like it could take a beating. Of course, I'll mostly use it here in the studio, probably just to hold my phone while I'm making drum covers. Last but not least, we have this Bobber tumbler. I love a hot cup of Joe in the morning, but I hate chugging it down when I'm running out the door. So I need a to-go vessel. This Bobber 12 ounce tumbler is an insulated travel mug that works for hot or cold drinks. It checks all the right boxes. It has a very clever 360 degree twist cap that lets you drink from any side. When it's open, the top is locked down. And then when you close it, so you can't drink, you can open up the lid. So really cool design and it just feels bulletproof. You could definitely drop this. It's totally spill-proof. Also like the 12 ounce size, I really don't need more coffee than that. I like the white color. And yeah, you can get this on their website or Amazon. I'll link to all this stuff down below in the description. And that's it for now. If you like this kind of video, where I just kind of show you some new stuff that's come across my desk recently, let me know. Hit the like button, leave a comment down below, and I will make more of them. If you have any questions, let me know in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching. And until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " This is $250 worth of hot garbage from T-Move. All of this for less than $250. I'm gonna try all this stuff on and give you my honest opinion. In fact, let's go ahead and try something on right now. All right, starting off with this pink crew-neck t-shirt and these light wash jeans. I think these were called like 90s jeans or something. You know what? I wore jeans like this when I was in middle school. And if I were 14, maybe this would be a good look, but it's not. And it also just feels really bad. Shirts, 100% polyester. The jeans are 15% polyester, 85% cotton. They feel extremely cheap. Obviously they don't fit. I did look at the size charts, by the way. These are the sizes that supposedly fit me, but the size charts on T-Move are all over the place. They're hard to decipher and they're not accurate. So this is what I got. The shirt feels sticky, like so synthetic. Throwing this sick bomber real quick. It looks like a tag was here inside, but it's cut off. So I can't actually tell what materials were used or anything about this, but obviously it doesn't fit at all. It feels like paper, made in China, 100% polyester. This is a small. According to the size charts, this one was supposed to fit pretty well. Can't really see what it looks like. It looks bad, right? A little too big. It has that rough sticky feel that you get when you're using 100% polyester for something that really should be cotton. But this video isn't just a review. I'm going to talk about T-Move as a company because, spoiler alert, this stuff is mostly junk. And I don't think anybody should be buying anything from the Chinese flea market that is T-Move, even if you're on a tight budget. But let's go ahead and try on something else. Alright, rate this fit down in the comments section. Got a little zipper right here. The zippers are difficult. Sorry, modesty. What do you think this one is made out of? Polyester. They're very long. I cuffed them over here so you could see what that looks like. But these were a best seller. T-Move men's fashion section. A little large in the waist for me. Again, I ordered my sizes according to the size charts. I think these are small. I don't know if it's meant to be this big. Maybe this is how it's supposed to look. Even if this stuff fit, the materials feel so bad. These pants feel like tissue paper. I might use these to wrap some Christmas presents, actually. I'll probably hold onto these. So as I unboxed this bag of crap, I could feel my suspicions about T-Move being confirmed. Like, we all know that a $2 pair of shorts can't be any good. Of course, the quality sucks. But beyond that, maybe these shorts actually shouldn't exist. Like, how can a pair of shorts be created and shipped to the other side of the world for $2.65? Someone has to be getting screwed in this process. It's certainly not the customer. I mean, $2 is practically free. Not the corporate execs at T-Move. The company profited over $8 billion last year. So who's losing here? We all kind of know, right? It's the people who actually make this stuff. It has to be. Speaking of which, let's try on another piece. Not that I would wear a vest over a short sleeve or like this, but wanted to show you this vest. I actually thought this one looked kind of cool on the website. In person, it feels like tissue paper. What does it say here? Friedenwe personality. Friedenwe personality. This zipper just says sports. It sucks. Maybe what I'm saying here is obvious to you. Maybe you'd never even consider buying something from a brand like T-Move or Shine. That's how I've always felt about these fast retail brands. I'm not anti-corporation or anti-business or anything. I've been an entrepreneur for most of my adult life. But seeing companies like T-Move thriving should shake anybody's... But seeing companies like T-Move thriving should shake anybody's belief in unbridled capitalism. And for you patriots who are thinking, it's not our fault, these are Chinese companies. Capitalism isn't the problem. Actually, T-Move is based in the US and it was launched to an American audience. Most of its revenue comes from Americans. But regardless of who's buying these products, I don't think these companies should exist. Shall we try on something else? If you're thinking nice T-shirt, yeah, this one's not from T-Move. It's from Orchard and Broom and it's really nice. I actually love it. It fits perfectly. It's like pretty sure it's 100% P. McCotten. And you know, it's like a $50 T-shirt or something. So definitely not T-Move and you can see and feel the difference. These shorts, however, are from T-Move. And honestly, of everything I got, these are probably the best. Don't get me wrong, they're extremely cheap. They just feel like $4 shorts. But I actually kind of like the way they fit. And I like the color. They're already kind of falling apart. But I don't hate them. So if I don't like fast fashion and I knew these clothes were gonna suck, why am I making this video? Because T-Move's influencer marketing is so incredibly aggressive. They kept reaching out and offering to sponsor a video. In the same week, I heard from actual T-Move employees, like with email addresses at timu.com, I heard from multiple marketing agencies, all hitting me up on different channels, including email and social media. To be fair, the people who I was corresponding with were very polite and friendly in a broken English sort of way. But man, they were really pushing sponsorships. Even after I was already in talks with somebody at T-Move, I was getting new emails and new inquiries from other T-Move employees and other marketing agencies. Much like their storefront, their marketing is just a chaotic mess. So I finally said, okay, let's do it. They wanted to give me $2,000 to make this video, but I keep it real. So I would never take money from a brand like this. I would, however, take some samples so I could show you how bad they are in real life. Speaking of which, let's look at some more. Another pair of shorts. These are faux corduroy. So they're kind of made to look like corduroy, but pretty sure they're 100% poly. Let's check, is there a tag? No tag. Obviously, they're a little big and baggy for me. I like my shorts a little shorter, a little more fitted, but I ordered according to the size chart and this is what I got. They feel extremely cheap. But my favorite feature, my favorite element of these shorts is this little hatch right here that says, point the same of view, deep. I think what they're trying to say is the same point of view, which is a weird thing to put on shorts, but point the same of view, that just doesn't make any sense. That's grammatically incorrect. You couldn't just get a native English speaker, hire somebody on Fiverr for a few dollars to come and just check this real quick, just proofread it before you put this on a bunch of shorts. Even if these fit better and were higher quality, I still don't want point the same of view on my shorts. Anyway, I really don't know what to do with these clothes. I mean, normally I would just take them to Goodwill, but even there they're gonna sell them for like $2 or $3 and that feels like too much. These need to be free. I need to give these away to somebody for free, but I don't wanna give them to a friend. Who can I give them to? I don't know, I might just leave them in a box on the street or something. Fun fact about Timu, their biggest rival and arch nemesis is Shine, which makes sense considering to me, it seems like the exact same business model. It's a real race to the bottom with these two. Shine and Timu keep suing each other over things like antitrust violations and copyright infringement, which is sort of like McDonald's suing Taco Bell over deceptive marketing practices. It's like, you all are the same. Anyway, in the creative brief that Timu sent me, they specifically said that I was not allowed to mention Shine, so I just wanted to mention Shine. I almost forgot about these socks. They did say that they were cotton, but just by touching them, I know that they're not. Let's just try one on here. You know when you go to a shoe store and they have that like tissue box with like the little socks that you're supposed to put on so you don't wear shoes with your bare feet? That's what these feel like. Plastic-y, like they stick to your feet as you try to put them on. The fit's not bad. I actually like the length. I like the kind of neutral colors that they came with, but yeah, I mean, they're just not cotton. So it's misleading that they describe these as cotton socks. My guess is that they're like everything else from Timu that I got, polyester. Okay, you might be wondering, well, what about everything else they sell other than the clothing? They sell a bunch of other stuff, accessories, home goods, tech. I tried a few non-clothing items, including this EDC flashlight and this knife, this little pen, this wallet, this watch. The EDC stuff is hit or miss. The knife is garbage. I'd rather just get something cheap from Amazon from like Kershaw or Spyderco. The flashlight is fine. It's a flashlight. I don't think I would buy any real electronics or like appliances from Timu. That's just not safe. This pen, which is much tinier than I thought it was gonna be, is supposedly titanium, but if you compare it to a real titanium pen, this one is from Bastion. I don't think it's titanium. I think it's steel or aluminum. And the action on it is just kind of grindy compared to this smooth bolt action on a real high quality pen. The watch is from Katasyn, which is a brand I've heard of. It's by far the most expensive sample that I got. I think it was like 50 or $60. Katasyn is a somewhat reputable brand if you consider knockoffs to be reputable. And this watch isn't bad. I mean, it's a ripoff of Rolex's oyster perpetual line. I've owned a 36 millimeter Rolex Explorer before, which is basically what this watch is imitating. And I mean, there's no comparison. The Rolex is much, much nicer in every single way. That's not to say this is terrible. It actually feels pretty good for the price. I just wish they would make an original design because they're clearly pretty good at making a decent quality watch for a very good price, but it's a knockoff. If it wasn't a ripoff, I'd probably wear it. So to be fair, yeah, you can find some decent stuff on Timu, but it's like hunting for a needle and a haystack. And anything decent like a Katasyn watch can be found elsewhere, probably from a more reputable and more ethical merchant. This wallet on the other hand, absolutely sucks. It just feels like plastic and it's gonna go in the giveaway pile with the rest of this stuff. Well, this was a weird little journey, but what's the bottom line? Based on my experience, pretty much everything that Timu sells is low quality junk. These products are disposable. The company doesn't care about the environmental damage they're doing. They don't seem to care about ethical labor practices. They're okay with breaking rules and bending laws. They'll do anything to make a buck. No one should support a company like this. And if you do support Timu by contributing to their $8 billion bottom line, I hate to say it, but you're part of the problem. Let's be better than Timu. Let's be better than Shine. Buy less, buy better. Buy once, cry once. Quality over quantity. Whatever platitude helps you avoid the temptation of loading up on cheap stuff that you don't really want or need and supporting a business that frankly doesn't deserve our support. That's it for today. If you have any thoughts about Timu or any questions for me, leave them down below in the comments section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " I'm on a hunt for comfortable, casual, everyday shoes. My two criteria are, one, they have to be comfortable, and two, they can't be hideous. This is tough because there seems to be an inverse relationship between comfort and aesthetic. In other words, shoes that are very comfy tend to be ugly, and shoes that are built for fashion tend to be uncomfortable. Think about a graph with comfort on the Y-axis and style on the X-axis. This is the inverse relationship. This diagonal line would be bookended by, like, Dr. Scholl's and Crox up here, and High Heels and Patten Leather Oxford's down here. And yes, I did test Crox, and we'll share my thoughts later in the video. You know, no one wants to be down here wearing ugly, uncomfortable shoes. I've spent a lot of time over here prioritizing form over function, wearing shoes that I like to look of, but that weren't necessarily the most comfortable, but I can't do that anymore. So I'm staying up in this top half, the comfort zone. I'd like to avoid this quadrant, shoes that are comfortable, but ugly as sin. And that leaves us with this quadrant up here, and hopefully that's what we'll explore in this video. Shoes that look pretty good, or good enough, and are very comfortable. So over the past few months, I've tested 13 different comfort-focused brands, and I will present my findings here within. Three quick things before we get into it. Number one, I have a bit of a cold right now, so if I look and sound a bit off, that's what's up. Two, this video is sponsored by Duer, a performance apparel brand founded by a business bro turned cyclist who wanted a pair of pants that could do it all. The shorts and pants that I'm wearing in this video, as well as this T-shirt are all from Duer, and I love them. I'll talk more about Duer in a little bit, but if you wanna check these clothes out, links below in the description. And finally, we need to define a couple of terms that I'll be using throughout the video, just so we're all on the same page. So, footwear 101. Supportive, a supportive shoe is not flexible. It has a rigid sole that's hard to bend or twist. Cushioned, a cushioned shoe feels squishy, usually due to some sort of foam that compresses under your weight. Arched support, shoes with arched support have a contoured insole and midsole that fills the space underneath your midfoot. Pro-nation, when your foot rolls inward as you walk, putting weight on the inside of your feet. Supination, the opposite of pronation, putting weight on the outside of your feet with each step. Stability is a running shoe term used to describe shoes that have reinforced midsolls to counteract excessive pronation or supination. These are kind of like bumpers at the bowling alley. Neutral, a neutral shoe is the opposite of a stability shoe. So, neutral shoes don't prevent any pronation or supination. Zero drop is just a shoe with a level sole. So, there's no difference in height between the toes and the heel. This is the opposite of a high heel. Flat means the same thing. Flat is just another term for zero drop. A barefoot shoe has a minimal padding between your feet and the ground. It basically has enough to protect you from dirt or sharp objects, but it still maximizes that ground feel. All barefoot shoes are zero drop. Natural, a natural or foot shaped shoe has a wide toe box that follows the shape of the human foot. Many, but not all barefoot shoes are natural or foot shaped. Finally, minimalist. You hear a lot about minimalist shoes, but what does it mean? Minimalist is an umbrella term used to describe shoes that have very little cushioning, support and stability. Most barefoot shoes can be considered minimalist shoes. While most minimalist shoes are zero drop, not all zero drop are minimalist. Okay, let's get into the shoes and FYI, during my research and testing, I created a Google Sheet that lists out all these shoes and their attributes and has links to buy them. So, I'll leave a link to that Google Sheet down below in the description. Starting with a brand called Adams. I've worn these shoes a lot over the last couple of years. Actually, this video was originally just gonna be a review of these shoes. Then I thought, you know, that's kind of boring. I should probably include some other brands. Six months later, I'm emerging from a footwear rabbit hole to bring you this video. So, I really hope the algorithm likes it. Adams is a unisex footwear brand that's been around for a while. It's been getting more attention since the brand released a collaboration with MKBHD, but their bread and butter has always been these simple, everyday, low top sneakers in a wide variety of sizes and colors. For a long time, they just had this one model, the 000, and then they released the 001, which is very similar. It's just a bit more structured with this cup style outsole, which is more like something you'd find on like a leather or canvas low top. But this 001 is still a soft, bouncy, and flexible shoe. I've tested both, and honestly, they're very similar. I feel like Adams kind of presents the 001 as an upgrade or almost like a replacement to the 000, but they still sell both. I'm not really sure why they have two models that are so similar. In my opinion, they're interchangeable. I think the original 000 is slightly better looking. But they're both comfortable. They both have these soft knit uppers and stretchy laces, which are kind of nice because you can tie them once, then they're easy to slip on and off. They both have noticeable cushioning. I wouldn't describe either of these as supportive shoes or stability shoes. They both have a lot of flex in the sole. I like the wide range of sizes. The original is even available in quarter sizes, which is really cool. I like the shape of the toe box. They're both pretty roomy, so good for people with wider feet. These sneakers both stay pretty fresh. They don't pick up odor. I will say the white gets pretty dirty, and I've tried to wash these in the washing machine and didn't really do anything. So if that bothers you, probably don't get these in white. I also don't love the kind of yellow outsole. I feel like a gumsole or a white sole would look better. Adams describes these shoes as a pared down look that can be dressed up or down effortlessly, but I disagree these do not dress up. I wouldn't wear either of these with dress pants or even jeans. They look right at home with shorts and joggers and performance style pants. Speaking of which, let's talk about today's sponsor, Deweyr. I like Deweyr because they make performance pants that don't look too techy, and they don't make that swishy sound when you walk around. Like, I'm all about comfort, especially as a dad with young kids, but I don't wanna look like a crew member of the USS Enterprise. Sorry, Trekkies. Deweyr's clothing has a more natural look and feel because the brand prioritizes plant-based materials like cotton and tensile. They're able to blend these natural fibers with high-quality synthetics to maximize comfort without going full space suit. For example, these no-sweat pants are mostly cotton and tensile with 4% extra stretch built in, and to me, the pants feel like lightweight, soft, brushed cotton jeans. They come in different cuts, but the slim fit is just right for me. I also like the no-sweat shorts in seven inches. I think that's the perfect length for shorts. They have a little bit of taper, but they aren't restrictive. I think the shape works well for my build, but it would be flattering on a wide variety of body types. This pure Pima T-shirt is, you guessed it, 100% Pima cotton. I don't have many red shirts, but I'm really liking this rust color. It's surprisingly versatile. It goes really well with like blue and tan or any neutral color. These new stretch five-pocket pants are 60% cotton, 30% nylon, 5% spandex. They're light, they're breathable. The fabric has a really nice drape, especially in this slim fit, which is actually a bit roomier than the slim no-sweat pants. It's a modern, comfortable silhouette, and this time color is right up my alley. I also got this performance stretch belt, which is one of the best belts that I've ever owned. If you wanna check out Do-It-For-Yourself, I'll link to each of these pieces down below in the description. Thank you to Do-It-Again for supporting the channel. Moving on to Allbirds. Specifically, the Tree Runner Go. These are the latest and greatest from the most popular internet shoe brand of all time. And I think they're the best thing that Allbirds has ever released. To be honest, I've never really liked this brand. I feel like it's just been the go-to choice for Silicon Valley programmers with too much money and too little taste. The original Allbirds wool runners were just ugly. And I don't think they really did anything special other than using wool for their uppers, which I guess was enough because the brand raised a bunch of money and grew incredibly fast and opened stores all around the world. I mean, their stock price did take a nosedive after they went public, but that's a video for a different channel. Anyway, I never got the Allbird type, but these Tree Runner Go's are actually pretty sweet. Their shape reminds me of one of my favorite shoes right now, the Brooks Adrenaline that I'll talk about in a little bit. They feel like legit running shoes with more structure and support than traditional Allbirds models. Like I would actually go running in these. I will say the size eight is pretty snug. I have to wear thin socks and I normally wear a size eight in sneakers. So just something to keep in mind. They look large on the outside, but they just have a lot of padding. I do feel a bit of pressure on top of my arch over the instep. That's often the case with me as I have a high instep and it's not a deal breaker here. These are some of the most plush leases I've ever felt very high quality. And I like the way these shoes look. I like the way they feel. At $120, these aren't insanely expensive, but for another $40 or $50, you can get flagship models from dedicated running brands like Brooks or ASICs or New Balance. I think many people will prefer the simpler, more minimal look of these Allbirds as opposed to something like ASICs, but you can't deny the manufacturing pedigree of the more established brands. Gysween Wool Sneakers. This shoe is what happens when an Austrian Allbirds takes a Converse Chuck Taylor, but makes the upper out of Merino Wool and the sole out of a plush EVA foam. Actually, Gysween's bestseller is a simple wool runner with a wool upper and foam sole, very much like the original Allbirds Wool Runner, but Gysween is a decades old company, so maybe Allbirds copied them. By the way, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Gysween, I'm just gonna go with it. The one thing though about Gysween's Wool Runner is every single color has this really large black logo and it's way too overt for my taste. I'd like to see that shrunk down and colored tonally to blend in with each different colorway. That's why I chose their Wool Sneaker, which is a less sporty sneaker with less obvious branding. They're pretty comfy right out of the box, partly because they're wider than many like court style low top sneakers. The upper and the removable footbed are both made with Merino Wool, so you could wear these in the heat even without socks and they'd be totally comfortable and odor wouldn't be a problem. They're also machine washable, which is great because I'm sure that these uppers collect dirt and dust. The style is a bit less athleisure than a lot of the other brands I've tried for this video. I think that you could wear these with like chinos, maybe even jeans. My only gripe is this size eight is pretty long. This is actually a 41 European and it's just a bit long. So it fits. It's okay to have that extra space in front of your toes and the width works, but I could probably size down to a seven. Ideally I'd wear a seven and a half, but they don't make half sizes. All in all though, I like these. Lem's Chillums, these are wide toe box, zero drop, ultra light casual shoes, sort of like a minimalist foot shaped vans classic. They're surprisingly comfortable out of the box, although the zero drop takes a bit of getting used to just because I haven't really worn zero drop shoes before. And yes, the shape is funny, but I think it's only funny because it's unusual. Like if every shoe was shaped like this and maybe they should be, it would just look normal. Also, why aren't shoes shaped like this? This is how our feet are shaped. What am I missing? These Lem's Chillums feel really high quality. The canvas upper is thick and sturdy. The cork insole should break in and mold to my feet over time. They just seem like they'll age really well and that they could take some abuse. And at just eight ounces, these are very light shoes. The lightweight combined with the zero drop makes these minimalist shoes. They're not barefoot shoes, but if you wanted to transition to barefoot, these would be a good choice. When I wear them regularly, I don't know. The shape does take some getting used to. I'm sure other people don't notice as much, but when I looked at them, I'm just like, yeah, it's a bit of a duck foot shape. Anyway, I'm definitely gonna give them a chance. Flux Adapt Trainers. Now, these are also zero drop barefoot style shoes. Like the Lem's, these have a wider than normal toe box. It's not quite as pronounced. This unique kind of cushioned bumpy insole sort of massages your feet when you put pressure down when you're walking or standing. It's a bit weird, but it's actually kind of a nice feeling. Kind of reminds me of like the inside of a hybrid mattress. Both mattresses and shoes separate us from the ground, so kind of makes sense. Coming in at under 10 ounces, these are also very light shoes. The fit is snug. It's not uncomfortable. I went with a seven and a half, which I think is the right size for me, but if I wanted to wear these with thicker socks, I'd probably size up to an eight. Now, to me, these look like athletic shoes. I wouldn't try to dress these up with jeans or chinos, but like joggers, sweatshorts, athletic shorts, t-shirts, tank tops, these are right at home. According to reviews, people seem to love these for hybrid type training like CrossFit stuff and Leg Day. I haven't used them for that sort of thing yet, but I'll definitely test them out. So far, they've been comfortable shoes to wear around the house and office. York Athletics, the Henry Runner. So I discovered this brand on Reddit. It showed up on a few different subs from our one bag to our sneakers, even male fashion advice. York Athletics Manufacturing is one of the slickest brands on this list. The name, the website, the history, the product design, it's just cool. The shoe I tried, the Henry Runner, looks really good. It comes in different materials, but I got this off-white mesh upper with the dark gum sole, which I think is a great combo. They also have these branded leather pull tabs, which is a nice functional detail. You just have like a retro feel. It's like something Rocky would wear when he's shadow boxing on the mean streets of Philly. It's lightweight, it's comfortable. I could see it being a good choice for cross training, where you're doing a little bit of running, a little bit of cardio, but also a little bit of lifting, a little bit of body weight. Compared to many modern running shoes, it's pretty minimal. I don't think I would choose these over my Brooks for a long run or hike, but I do like a bit more support and stability from my running shoes. These shoes are also a bit narrow, and you can see them next to some of the other shoes that I tried. I tested a size at seven and a half and eight, and the seven and a half actually worked really well if I removed the insul, but with the insul, it was just too snug and too narrow in the toe box. So I went with the eights, which fit a little better. I think a perfect size would be like a seven and a half wide if they made wide sizes. So if you find that many shoes are too narrow or you need a wider shoe, these probably aren't for you. That said, if you have a regular or narrow foot and you want a stylish option for everyday use and hybrid training, I think these are a great choice. The Samuel Hubbard Performance Walker. Here is a grippy, lightweight leather and rubber shoe with lots of padding, lateral stability, built-in arch support, and frankly, one of the best removable insules that I've ever seen on any shoe. It's probably worth $40 or $50 on its own. This kind of looks like a hiking shoe, and I'm gonna be honest, it's not the most attractive shoe on this list. It makes sense. The brand Samuel Hubbard was started by the family behind Rockport, which is like the OG comfy shoe brand. It actually sold to Reebok in the 80s. So this new brand, owned by the same family, is still mostly focused on comfort above all else. Their designs are kind of like Rockport or Merrill, which is to say, hit or miss, mostly miss. But credit where it's due, these Performance Walkers were insanely comfortable right out of the box. They are high volume shoes with plenty of width and height in the toe box, even in a regular width. This is a seven and a half medium. I could have gotten an eight wide. If the seven and a half wide was available, I probably would have picked it. But honestly, even in this medium or regular width, they feel pretty good. I would say this medium width is wider than most shoes. There's just not much taper through the mid-foot, so there's no restrictions on the arch or the instep. But yeah, I mean, they're ugly. Maybe the brown color would have been a better choice. I just didn't like the brown and black combo, so I went with the gray and black. I think these would look fine with some taller hiking socks and shorts. I definitely would not wear them with jeans. I wouldn't try to dress them up. These are a function over form option. Speaking of divisive looks, these are the New Balance 990 V6. I like these shoes. I made a whole video about them, which you can go check out. These were the first pair of shoes that I bought specifically for comfort after dealing with two years of slowly mounting foot pain. And they're still near the top of my list in terms of comfort. And even though some people hate the way these look, I find them oddly easy to style, even with chinos. They are pretty chunky though, which is part of the reason why they're so comfortable. I wouldn't wear them with super slim fit pants or skinny jeans. It would just be a mismatch. They have arch support built in. They're a firm, stable shoe. They're much more supportive and less squishy than something like an Ultra Boost. I tried a bunch of size and width combinations, and I ended up with a seven wide. Technically, these are a women's eight and a half extra wide just because that's what was in stock, but it's the equivalent of a men's seven wide. And by the way, these shoes are unisex if you figure out the conversion. So don't worry about whether you're technically buying a woman's shoe. Point being, they run large. I recommend going like a quarter size down from your Braneck sizing, or maybe choose the same size that you wear in dress shoes. And yes, these are pricey at $200, but that's because they're made in the USA. They're made from premium materials. They feel much different than cheaper new balances like your standard 574s. Bottom line, I really like these. They're super comfortable, and they definitely will not be my last pair of new balances. Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23. After wearing the Brooks Ghost for a few years, mostly for running or hiking, I switched to the Adrenaline, which has more cushion and stability and support compared to the more minimal Ghost. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Even compared to the New Balance 990s, these are slightly better, at least for my feet. I don't think they're necessarily a better all-around shoe because they're pretty sporty, and I think harder to style than the new balances. They're impossible to dress up, but for athleisure situations, they work well. These are eight and a half mediums, which is a half size up from what I normally wear, even in sneakers. I think if I buy them again, which I will, I'll probably go with an eight wide. These eight and a halfs are just a touch long, but these definitely run small. Like a full size smaller than the New Balance 990s. They're just so comfortable. Whenever I'm going on a trip, if I'm gonna be in the airport for a few hours, or going on a long hike, I always reach for these because they're just the best thing I've found so far. Okay, let's talk sandals. These are the Chakos Z-Cloud and Tiva Original Universal. I wanna talk about these two together because they're made for the same activities, but they're actually very different sandals. These Chakos are chunky, supportive, they're durable. They have adjustable straps. Mine don't have the big toe loop, but you can get that version if you prefer it. The Tivas are lightweight, flexible. They're also waterproof. They also have adjustable straps, although these are Velcro. And they're made with vegan friendly recycled materials. Tiva also makes heavier duty sandals that are more similar to Chakos, but these Original Universal are probably their best seller. And I think for good reason, I mean, they're ultra light. They're just over six ounces. So these are the lightest footwear that I own. They're half the price of Chakos. They're soft and flexible underfoot. Super easy to adjust these straps for maximum comfort. Although the Velcro, the Velcro will wear out over time. They handle water really well, so they're perfect for any outdoor activity that involves water, but the Chakos also handle water really well. And they're actually grippier than the Tivas. So they're really good for like, any hikes that involve water crossings. They're much firmer than the Tivas, and they have arch support built in. So it's a more supportive, more stable shoe. I wore the Tivas a lot for a few years, but these days I slightly prefer the Chakos. I think my aging feet just need a little bit more of a supportive foundation, but if you like more of a barefoot feel, if you like to feel the ground and you like to have some flex, the Tivas are a better choice. Both run large. These are both size seven and they both fit properly. I would say that if Chakos made a seven and a half, I'd buy it. Birkenstocks Arizona. Sticking with sandals for a minute, can't really make a video about comfy footwear without including Birkenstock. This is Birkenstock's best seller. They're insanely popular. They've been loved for decades by all kinds of people from festival going hippies to festival going podiatrists. They've got arch support, they've got stability. They're technically zero drop. They're firm. Even if you get the soft footbed model, which these are, they're still very firm. They run large and wide. I could wear a 38 or 39, which is like a men's six and a half in US sizing. But the weird thing is, I don't like these anymore. Years ago, I had a similar pair, but that had the heel strap and the original firmer footbed. And I found those to be very comfortable, probably because of the heel strap. I wore them a lot. They were like my most comfortable shoes back then. So maybe my feet changed. Maybe I just need the heel strap. Maybe it's the soft footbed, but I just don't find these very comfortable anymore. Actually find them to be a little painful in this metatarsal region. And you can see that Birkenstocks has this reinforced metatarsal like toe bar. And all of their models have this unfortunately. You can't buy a Birkenstock without this little ridge under your toes. I'd even tried to hammer this thing down. Some people say it works, but it doesn't work. So at least for now, Birkenstocks are out for me. And again, that's just me. Most people love these and you probably would too. Amberjack is a newish hybrid dress shoe brand, kind of like a Kohan from millennials. I really don't wear dress shoes very often. And when I do, I just wear traditional dress shoes with a leather sole and Goodyear. Well, I really don't like hybrid dress shoes, but Amberjack offered to send this pair of hybrid Chelsea boots and I figured I'd test them out. For some reason, the hybrid boot, or at least this one is just less offensive. I think maybe because it has this brown outsole instead of white, it's just less noticeable. They really do feel more like sneakers than boots when you slip them on. They have some arch support built in. They're a high volume boot. So they run large and roomy. This is a size seven, but it has plenty of room in the toe box, even with thicker socks. It feels like an eight or an eight and a half sneaker. I've actually worn these quite a bit. I mean, if you like the Chelsea boots style, or if you just find that traditional boots are uncomfortable for you, you might like these. Then again, for $200, you can get yourself a traditional Goodyear welted boot with a leather or lug sole that can be resold. So just something to consider. Last and probably least, Crocs. This is my first experience with the mostly hated, but recently trendy brand. This off-road version of the ventilated clog is complete with a lug outsole and adjustable heel strap. It's got this Velcro heel strap, which I think is great. These are very wide shoes. So if you don't like the feeling of your feet or your heels moving around, you won't like these unless you wear very thick socks. You know, Crocs and socks, that's controversial. They're not overly long though. I size down to a seven because these run large and my toes almost reach the end. So they're kind of just tall and wide. I could wear these with the thickest socks I own without feeling cramped. They're ugly. My wife laughs at me every time I wear these. I don't think I'd wear them outside of the house, but they're perfect for wearing around the house or to take the trash out or go grab the mail. You know, playing in the backyard, they're great for that. You can also wear them with or without the heel strap. You can just put it forward like that and then they're just slip-ons, kind of like slides. I kind of like the heel strap because they just feel a bit more secure. Honestly, so far the comfort is nothing to write home about. Maybe I just need to break them in a bit more, but I don't really get the hype. By the way, these specific all-terrain Crocs in this color are from Huckberry. That's a lot of footwear. You might be wondering which of these are the best? It's a tough question because you could rank all these in different ways, like most comfortable or best looking or best for a specific activity. So let's dole out some totally subjective awards. The best looking everyday shoes on this list are Adams, Gai Sween and Amber Jacks. The most comfortable are the new balances and the Brooks. The best barefoot style or minimalist shoe is the Lens Chillums. I would also say that's the best wide toe box shoe. The best shoes for people with lots of foot pain, like what podiatrist would probably recommend, are the new balances, the Brooks and the Samuel Hubbard's. The best shoes for working out are the Flux Adapt Trainers and the York Athletics Henry Runners. The best running shoes are the Brooks and the Allbirds. The best sandals are the Chakos, although that's totally subjective. The ugliest shoes on this list are the Samuel Hubbard's and the Crocs. My personal top five would be new balance, Brooks, Adams, Gai Sween and Chakos. And that's it. If you have any other brands I should check out because I'm still on this journey, please let me know down in the comment section. Thanks to Doer again for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. Definitely go check them out. This stuff is so comfortable. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " When I say expensive, I mean relatively. Like a $20 cheeseburger is expensive compared to most cheeseburgers. A $20 ribeye is relatively cheap. A $20 cow is a scam. In this video, I'm talking about things that are expensive for what they are, even though some of them don't cost a ton of money. For example, this deodorant, it's Jack Black Pit Boss and it costs about $22 a stick. That's a lot for deodorant. But it lasts a long time, it smells great, and I've found that it does a good job controlling sweat without any irritation compared to cheaper antiperspirants. That's why it's the only deodorant that I've used for the past couple of years. Sticking with personal care for a minute, you know it's also worth the money? High quality SPF moisturizer. I've tried a bunch of these and I'll link to my favorite options below in the description. But in my experience, the really good stuff can be like $20 or $30 a tube. It's pricey, but it's much better than using cheap sunscreen on your face, or worse, not using any SPF protection at all. These higher end SPF moisturizers go on like lotion, and they usually contain some anti-aging ingredients as well. Once you upgrade, it's hard to go back. Okay, let's move on to menswear and accessories, starting with watches. I've owned a few luxury tier watches in my day and I haven't regretted any of them. Don't get me wrong, I like affordable watches too. The only time I've regretted buying a watch is when it was a compromise. When I settled for a watch, knowing it wasn't really the one I wanted, usually due to budget or availability. I think it's better to save up for the watch that you actually want. That way you'll be delighted every single time you look down at your wrist. Like these new Tangente 38 dates from one of my favorite watch brands, Nomos Classuta. A quick side note, this limited edition is sold out online, but you can still find it at select retailers. So go to Nomos' website and use the retailer locator to find one near you. Now I've worn several Nomos watches over the years, and one thing I really love about this brand is their use of color. These special edition Tangentes were created to celebrate 175 years of watchmaking in Classuta. Each of the 31 different colorways is limited to just 175 pieces. So if you like one, don't sleep on it, and again you can find these at select retailers. 31 colors for 31 days of the month, 31 different moods, and personalities. All of them are technically impressive. They're powered by the in-house DUW4101 mechanical movement, and you can watch this impossibly thin movement in action as you wind it up by hand through the sapphire crystal glass back. I've always loved watches with date windows. I think it's such a practical complication. I use it all the time, but the thing is sometimes they can throw off a watch's balance. This six o'clock date window is perfectly placed to maintain symmetry, and all the date windows are perfectly matched with the color composition of the dial. The second hand sub-dial can be a subtle or bold detail depending on which color composition you choose. I got my hands or wrists on three different colors. Peace, bubblegum, and type C grow? I'm definitely not pronouncing that correctly. Apologies to any German viewers. Peace features bright complementary shades of blue and an almost vermilion orange. The dial is squeaky clean and highly legible. Bubblegum has a dusty pink dial with a golden yellow sub-dial and a silver white date window. I'd never really considered buying a pink watch, but not gonna lie, this one has me thinking. And finally, inspired by deep sea creatures, type C grow, type C grow, has a muted black dial and a pink minute ring. I love the cream colored indices and typography and the way that the date window just blends in with the dial. This is probably my favorite of the three, but I would happily wear any of these.

Okay, moving on to footwear, here's another expensive purchase that was worth the money, the new Balance 990 V6. These main the USA sneakers are from the brand's flagship collection. They're more than twice as expensive as the entry-level new balance models. You can find it Dick's Sporting Goods, like the 574s. And at $200, they are expensive for sneakers. I mean, you can't get these resold after you wear them out in a year or 18 months. They're done. And they're not hyped. You can't sell these for a profit on eBay. They're expensive because of the materials and the construction and the fact that they're made in the US. But they're well engineered. They have a ton of R&D behind them. And if you test these side by side with something like the 574s, it's no competition. I mean, the 990s are better in every way. And I actually think they look a little better. They're more supportive, more stable, more durable. And I think they look a bit more interesting. And by the way, every sneaker brand has their flagship models. So E6, Nike, Adidas, Sokone, they all have their cheap entry-level stuff that's like, you know, $50 to $100. Then they have like their $140 to $200. And I think it's worth the upgrade. Speaking of comfort, if you want to make the shoes you already own more comfortable, consider orthotic insoles. These come in all different shapes and sizes and levels of support depending on what you need. The really good ones can cost like $50 to $70. And I know what you're thinking, couldn't I just buy new shoes? And I get that. But the thing is you can use one pair of insoles in all of your shoes. So they do go a long way. And if you're dealing with like arch pain or plantar fasciitis or something like that, I think it's worth spending the money. My personal favorites right now are these Superfeet medium cushion arch support insoles. They're much softer than your standard Superfeet insoles. But you should definitely go to a store and just try on a bunch of them and, you know, talk to an expert, see what works for you. Premium swim trunks. For years, all I wore were these Orla Bar Brown Bulldog Sports Swim Trunks at full retail. They're $300. I still think they're some of the best swim shorts ever made. But you can spend a lot less than that and still get a high quality pair. I have trunks from Chubbies and Bird Dogs, which both cost around $70. And they're both fantastic. Sure, $70 is a lot of money when you can spend 15 bucks at H&M and get a pair of trunks. But if you try them on side by side, the difference looks and feels obvious. So I say this summer, don't settle for cheap, fast fashion swim trunks, spend a little bit more and get something that'll last you a few seasons. Progress Jiu-Jitsu Shorts. Now, I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and before you think, wow, this guy is cool. Just know that I've been a blue belt, which is one step above white belt for like five years. And I only train a couple times a week. I'm not a natural. I'm very much a hobbyist. So you're not going to get any advice about Jiu-Jitsu from me. But man, do I love this sport. It's so much fun. It's a great workout. You're supposed to wear special shorts for grappling, ones that don't have any pockets or zippers. For a long time, I bought cheap grappling shorts just off of the Amazon. One of my training partners tip me off on this brand called Progress. Thank you, Cam. And I've been buying their $50 Academy Hybrid shorts for a while now, which are the most comfortable and durable Jiu-Jitsu shorts that I've tried. I've tried other brands that are supposedly even better, but these just fit me really well. A lot of grappling or MMA shorts are very long and baggy and just have these garish designs. But these Progress shorts are nice and fitted without being too tight. And I like this simple design. Totally worth the money. Now, I did try their shirts too, but I actually prefer a different brand. Hayabusa. I love their rash guards and specifically their long sleeve rash guards. My favorite is their Geo long sleeve rash guard in black. Very tasteful design without being boring. Fits me really well. It's tight, but not super tight. And I found that these can take abuse better than other brands, which is good because I take a lot of abuse on the mats. Unless I'm rolling with Bobby, then it's barely even a workout. Allen Edmonds Park Avenue. These were actually a Christmas gift from my parents like 15 years ago when I was working in entry level office jobs after college. My dad always wore Allen Edmonds and these were my first pair of like nice dress shoes. I wore them a lot over the years. They've always been comfortable. They've aged nicely despite my neglect. I've never had them refinished or resold. I don't know if Allen Edmonds still makes them like this, but there are plenty of brands that do. I don't think most guys need many pairs of dress shoes. You know, my advice would be to get one really good pair that's good year-welded or Blake stitched, full grain leather, something that can be resold and that will get better with use. You'll actually save money in the long run. Prescription sunglasses. These actually are not prescription, but I have had prescription sunglasses in the past. I just lost one pair and then I broke the other one. So I don't have any right now, but I'm going to buy more because they're totally worth the money. The thing is where I live, it's just very sunny. I wear sunglasses way more than I wear regular glasses. And even though I have a mild prescription, for me it's worth it to have a corrective lenses in my sunglasses. Every time I get a new pair, it's like seeing the world in HD for the first time. Again, not prescription. You get the point. I need a new pair, so if you have any brand suggestions, other than like Warby Parker, let me know. Blast up in the clothing category, alterations. I'm a huge proponent of getting your clothes tailored so they fit the way you want them to. But every time I suggest tailoring, I always get comments complaining about how it's too expensive. And I get not wanting to spend extra money on clothes that you already bought, but that $60 you spent on those jeans is a sunk cost. So you could either never wear them, in which case you've wasted the $60, or you could spend an extra 10, 15 bucks to get them hemmed, and then they're your new favorite jeans, you wear them all the time. I spent thousands of dollars on alterations over the years, and I don't regret a single penny of it. I'm telling you, if you've never gone to a tailor, it's a game changer. Just trust me on this one. Okay, moving on to office and studio gear. So basically the stuff I use to work and run this channel. First up, good lighting. You don't need dedicated or professional lights to start a YouTube channel, or grow your TikTok following. Natural light works if you have enough of it, but it can be too dim, too harsh, or just too unpredictable. An on-demand source of continuous light that's temperature controlled makes things much easier. Every time I upgrade my lighting, it feels expensive, but I always wish I did it sooner. I currently use a light from Amaran and another one from Godox, each with a different type of diffuser. And I love them both. I'd say they're about equal quality. Neither one of them is like entry level, but they're also not crazy expensive. Very much like prosumer grade. Oh, and don't skimp on the stands. Cheap stands are just horrible to work with, kind of like cheap tripods. This is very much a buy once, cry once category. A standing desk. I got this bamboo motorized standing desk, probably like six or seven years ago. And at the time it felt like a huge purchase, but it's held up really well, and it doesn't show any signs of aging. I've moved this desk from Arizona to New York, and then down to Virginia and back to Arizona, kind of a tach suit at this point. And of course, it's really nice to be able to switch between sitting and standing. A high quality office chair. When I am sitting down, I use this steel case Amia. Amia? Amia? Let's go with Amia. Before I got this, I used a cheap chair from Staples, and man, what a difference a good chair makes. One big difference is just how adjustable this chair is. Higher end and more expensive office chairs have way more adjustability. Everything from lumbar support to the tilt of the armrests. If you sit a lot, I think a good chair is worth the price. At this point, I couldn't go back to something cheap. Airpods. I think this is the best product that Apple has come out with in years, and the pro version is definitely worth the upgrade. I mean, just for the noise cancellation and the transparency mode alone, I think they're worth the extra money. I listen to several hours of audiobooks each week, mostly when I'm like doing dishes or carrying around a baby. I also wear these in meetings and Zoom calls. I use them all the time, and unlike my old version 1 AirPods, the battery life on these has held up. I don't see any degradation at least, not yet. I know there are other wireless earbuds that probably have better audio quality, but were they designed by Apple in California? I didn't think so. Airpods Pro. Speaking of Apple fanboyism, another expensive product that was worth every penny was my MacBook Pro. 14-inch M1. I was slightly disappointed with my previous MacBook Pro, which was the 13-inch version with the Touch Bar. Touch Bar was totally worthless, but this M1 has pretty much restored my faith. It's not perfect. I've experienced some glitches, but for the most part, it handles whatever I throw at it, including editing large 4K video files and using programs like Final Cut, Logic, and Photoshop, often at the same time. It was an expensive machine at over $3,000, but honestly, my only regret is not spending a little more to max out the storage. I always think it's going to be enough hard drive space. Like I had one terabyte with my last laptop, I got two in this one, and guess what? I need four. Next time, I'm specking it out, take my money, Apple. And last up in the studio category is my most recent kind of expensive purchase. It's this Roland TD27KV2 electronic drum kit. This is really one of the only like toys that I've ever bought. It's not top of the line. You can spend more on e-drums, but it's a nice kit, and it does feature some best in class components like Roland's digital snare drum. I've been having a lot of fun with this kit. I want to play more once I have a little more time in the future, but even just playing a little bit each week has been really fun. By the way, you can check out at Brock plays drums if you want to see me playing and hear how this kit sounds. Moving on, let's talk about some expensive purchases that were worth the money for the home. First up, a vacuum. This LG cord zero was an upgrade from a cheaper cordless vacuum that we were using. There's a night and day difference in the build quality and the power. I was going to buy Dyson, but after researching it, it seemed like this LG was a little bit better on hard surfaces, which is what we mostly have. And it came with an extra battery, which is nice because these cordless vacuums really drain the battery pretty quickly. I'm sure Dyson's are fantastic too. People seem to love them, but either way, it's nice to have a high quality cordless vacuum in the house. I can even detach the long part and then use this bad boy to clean stale Cheerios out of my car. Next up, a king size hybrid mattress. After sleeping on a queen size all foam mattress, this hybrid King is definitely an upgrade. It wasn't cheap, but anything that can improve your sleep is worth the price, in my opinion. I really like these hybrid mattresses, which are basically like the old school spring mattresses, just with a layer of foam or sometimes latex on top. But unlike the all foam mattresses, these just don't trap heat. The larger size also helps reduce overheating and from what I hear, it's a must as your kids get older and start seeking into bed. Last up, this Weber Genesis grill. My last grill before this one was a cheap one from Nexgrill. It wasn't terrible. It just didn't age very well and it became very uneven. In comparison, this Weber feels like an actual tank. It heats up incredibly fast and the cooktop is totally even. Plus, Weber supposedly has one of the best warranties in the business. If I take care of this grill and replace parts as needed, it should last 15, 20 years or longer. So that's my list. I would love to hear from you what's something that you bought recently or anytime that felt expensive, but that you don't regret. Let me know down in the comment section.

        "transcript": " Being a shorter guy can be a huge advantage. For example, when flying on a plane, I always have plenty of leg room. Hide and seek. Good luck finding me. But being not tall does present a few problems in life. It can be hard to see the stage at concerts. And when that cute girl at the library asks you for help getting her favorite book off the top shelf, you have to say, sure thing, even though you're not 100% sure if you can reach it. And of course you realize that pretty much all shirts sleeves are too long for your arms. The problem is most clothes simply aren't designed for shorter men. They're designed for the average guy. And this is especially true for long sleeve button-up shirts like casual button-downs or dress shirts. If your shirts sleeves are too long, it totally ruins your look even if the rest of your outfit is on point. Kind of gives you that kid wearing his dad's work clothes vibe. Now I'm five, six with shoes on after yoga, so I am intimately familiar with this problem and its solutions. By the end of this video, you'll know how to prevent buying shirts with sleeves that are too long in the first place and how to fix all the shirts that you already own. Let's talk first about preventing the problem because as the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. There are two ways to avoid sleeves that are too long. One, you can buy custom shirts and two, you can buy from very specific brands. Let's look at each option in more detail. Going custom can be a great option and these days you can get a custom shirt for as little as like $50, which is amazing. With made-to-order shirts, you can customize nearly everything from the fabric to the collar style and even the types of buttons. But the biggest benefit of custom is the fit. You can customize the length and the width of the shirt and of course the sleeve length. I've tried many custom menswear brands from the mainstays like Indochino and Suit Supply to more obscure higher-end brands like Lanyetti and Alan David. When I ran my blog, I would review these brands all the time so I've gone through the made-to-measure process countless times. It's a tricky process. It often results in an ill-fitting shirt. This is especially true if it's your first time going custom or just your first time working with a new brand. It just takes a while to really dial in your fit and a lot of guys will just give up frustrated because it wasn't as easy as these brands said it was gonna be. I mean, many of these online made-to-measure shirt brands say that they can create a perfectly fitting garment just from a couple of selfies or just from going through a questionnaire. And in my experience, this almost never works. Custom also takes a long time, like three to six weeks to get your shirt made and delivered to your door. So the bottom line is going custom can be a great option for anybody who needs shorter sleeves but it's not the easiest or most convenient option and you need to keep your expectations realistic. If possible, I always recommend getting measured in person by a professional. So going to a local custom tailor or shopping with one of the brands that has retail locations like Suit Supply. This is almost always better than measuring yourself or relying on a finicky algorithm. Luckily, there's another option that I think is even better. These days, shorter guys or guys with shorter arms have the option to buy from specialty brands that make clothes specifically for shorter men. My go-to brand for this is Ash and Eerie. They make all kinds of clothes, including dress shirts and casual button-ups, all of which have sleeves that fit me perfectly. Fun fact, I actually backed Ash and Eerie's fundraising campaign on Indiegogo back in 2015. So it's kind of cool that nine years later, they're supporting me by sponsoring this video. Ash and Eerie is one of the most represented brands in my wardrobe. And what I mean by that is when I'm putting together an outfit on any given day, there's a very good chance that at least one item is from Ash and Eerie. And it's not just button-up shirts. I'm talking about t-shirts, pants, shorts, and outerwear. It all fits me really well right out of the box, much better than anything that I'd find at the mall or a department store. And of course, their casual button-ups and dress shirts have shorter sleeve lengths that are designed to fit and flatter guys like me without any tailoring. So if you don't want to spend extra time on money getting your clothes tailored and you don't want to go custom, I highly recommend checking out Ash and Eerie. Go over to Ashandery.com or check the link in the description. I will link to this exact shirt and I'll include any exclusive promo codes. Okay, so we talked about preventing sleeves that are too long on new shirts that you might buy, but what about all the shirts that you already own? You probably have a few shirts in your closet that look pretty good except for the fact that the sleeves are too long. Here are five ways to deal with that, and yes, I am saving the best for last. Number one, wear another layer. Now this isn't rocket science and you're probably already doing it. Just wear a jacket or a sweater over your button-up. This extra layer will hide the excess length of your sleeves. This works better in cooler seasons, but it can work in spring or summer as long as you use lightweight breathable layers. So think like a linen sport coat, not like a heavy wool blazer, or a lightweight cotton pullover versus like a wool cashmere sweater. Like this outfit, are my sleeves too long? No one will ever know. Just keep in mind that that layer might come off at some point, like if you're at a wedding, you're probably gonna take your jacket off, so your cover-up will be exposed, so just keep that in mind. Another obvious way to fix sleeves that are too long is just to roll them up. I actually did a whole video about how to roll your sleeves up, all the various methods you can try, so you can go check that out, but I usually like the kind of forearm roll where you roll the sleeve up around like mid forearm, just about like that. It's casual, it's comfortable, kind of has that gym helper from the office vibe. I actually really like the sleeves rolled up look, so even when my sleeves aren't too long, like on this shirt, I'll still roll them up just for the effect. Also from what I understand, rolling your sleeves up like this is the male equivalent of wearing a short skirt. Number three is the faux French cuff. So if your sleeves are very long, like a whole cuff length past your wrist, you can try this. You simply roll your sleeves once, then you button them in reverse or invertedly to create a kind of fake French cuff. This works best when you're wearing your shirt under a sport coat or a blazer or a suit coat because it's kind of obvious, but under a jacket, it really does look like a French cuff. By the way, you can do this with outerwear too. It's not the best permanent solution, but it does work. Like for this jacket, the sleeves are about one cuff length too long. It's a little easier to do when you're not wearing the jacket. And it's not a perfect solution. It can result in the cuffs being a little tight, but it works in a pinch. Number four, try sleeve garters. Now this isn't for everybody, but I think some guys would really like it. Sleeve garters are an old school accessory that you really don't see much anymore. They were popularized in the late 1800s when men's dress shirts were mostly made with one extra long sleeve length. This is like when shirts were just beginning to be mass manufactured. And guys needed a way to customize their sleeve length and prevent their cuffs from getting dirty. Keep in mind, this is back when men would wear button-up shirts all the time, even for like factory work and cowboy stuff. Sleeve garters sort of squeeze your sleeves around the bicep. They shorten your sleeve to whatever length you want. And that's kind of nice because you can choose the exact length as needed. So like if you have a jacket that has slightly longer sleeves, you can just adjust the garter to make your sleeves a little longer. Sleeve garter sort of remind me of like speakeasy bartenders or old school poker dealers. And not necessarily in a bad way. These days, of course, they're not common. So if you wear these, you're gonna get some attention. Obviously you might have a jacket on, in which case they'll be invisible, just like underwear. But when your jacket comes off, people are gonna notice. If you do wear sleeve garters, I recommend not pairing them with other kind of old school accessories like suspenders or fedoras. It's very easy to slide into Peaky Blinders cosplay territory, which is great for Halloween, but maybe not Wednesday morning staff meetings. Number five, last but not least, get your shirts tailored. This is the best way to deal with sleeves that are too long on shirts that you already own. Simply go to the tailor, have your sleeve shortened to the exact right length, and then they'll fit you perfectly forever. I swear, tailoring is like a secret weapon of guys who dress really well. And every time I go to the tailor, I only see women there. So I still feel like most guys just don't get their clothes tailored. I'm at the tailor somewhat regularly. I'm getting pants hemmed and sleeves shortened and shirts taken in. Sure, not all of my clothes need it. My Ashtoniri shirts don't need any adjustments, but I don't wanna be limited to just one brand. Getting your sleeve shortened is gonna cost you anywhere from 10 to $25, depending on where you live. But it's totally worth it for shirts that you already own because it's cheaper than buying a new shirt. So this is actually a frugal and environmentally friendly solution because you're not buying anything new and you're not throwing anything away. Pro tip, if you're getting a dress shirt tailored that you're gonna wear with like a blazer or a sport coat or a suit, be sure to bring a jacket to the tailor and try it on as they're pinning you up because that way you can make sure that the sleeves are the perfect length to wear under a jacket. You know, you want a tiny bit of that sleeve cuff showing beyond the jacket sleeve, maybe a quarter inch. Oh, and if your sleeves are also too wide or too baggy, you can also get that fixed during that same trip to the tailor. Just ask for your sleeves to be taken in. The tailor will know what that means and they'll do both alterations at the same time. So when it comes to buying new shirts, I recommend avoiding buying shirts with sleeves that are too long by either going custom or even better, shopping with specialty brands like Ashtoniri. For the shirts you already own, I recommend getting them tailored. If you need a quick fix, just roll up the sleeves or throw on an outer layer. That's it for today. If you have any other tricks up your overly long sleeves, please drop them down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " I bet this isn't the first packing tips video you've watched. I bet you've seen all the weird little hacks like putting your necklace in a straw and heard all the obvious advice like checking the weather for your destination. Like yeah, who doesn't check the weather before going on a trip? And who's packing all these extra necklaces? Rather than listing a bunch of gimmicky hacks, I'm gonna help you actually get good at packing. So you can pack efficiently without forgetting anything important, but also without overpacking. And I wanna help you plan a capsule wardrobe for your trip. So every day that you're away from home, you can easily put together an outfit that makes you feel great. With that goal in mind, we'll break the packing process into two parts. Number one is deciding what to bring and creating a capsule wardrobe. Number two is folding your clothes and packing your suitcase the right way. But we're gonna do this Tarantino style and start at the end. So first we'll pack our suitcase and then I'll outline the simple, repeatable process that I use to figure out which clothes to bring on any kind of trip. All right, let's get packing. First off, don't do any of those weird TikTok packing hacks where you fold all of your clothes on top of each other. That doesn't make any sense. Also, don't worry about the whole rolling versus folding debate. Neither method is gonna totally eliminate wrinkles and you're gonna use a mix of both. If you use packing cubes, just know that they don't really save space unless you use the compression kind. Personally, I think they're overrated. Okay, start with everything laid out on your bed. This is the capsule wardrobe that you put together in the planning phase that we'll talk about later. Open up your suitcase. Start by rolling up your socks nice and tight and stuff them into your shoes. You can also put your belt in there if you have extra room. Put the shoes in the dust cover and put them in your suitcase so they straddle the parallel bars under the rich brown ringspun twill liner. Speaking of ringspun twill, at this point, you might be wondering about this suitcase. Let's take a closer look. It's the 35-liter cabin travel case from the Sterling Pacific who was kind enough to support the channel by sponsoring this video. This is a top of the line aluminum carry-on designed by detail-obsessed frequent flyers for maximum functionality and durability. I've gotten to know James, the president of Sterling Pacific over the past couple of months and let me tell you, the man is obsessed with every tiny detail of this luggage. When I unboxed it, my first impression was luxury. But after chatting with James and learning more about the design and manufacturing process, I realized that underneath the sheen, this bag is a real spec monster. First of all, it's made with 5052 aluminum, which, according to Wikipedia, has exceptional corrosion resistance, which makes it a primary candidate for failure-sensitive large marine structures. Apparently, this particular alloy is mostly used for aircraft, architecture, large ocean-bound vessels, and this suitcase. The A380 aluminum corners and patented impact-bearing ridges increase durability. The Italian full-grain leather used on the handles is aniline-dyed, so it lets the actual grain of the hide show through. And look at these oversized wheels. These are dual through-axle wheels. I don't even know what that means, but I like it. And I bet they could handle the ancient cobblestone streets of Naples better than any cheap four-wheeled plastic luggage. Speaking of plastic, I can't find any. Even these little strap clips are metal. Listen to that. Listen to these latches. I feel like Don Draper. And this Starling Pacific cabin case comes with some nice extras, like this little amenity's bag, some Maiden USA leather wax, and an aluminum pen. I never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but this is gorgeous luggage. Links below in the description if you wanna check it out for yourself. Okay, let's get back to packing this beautiful bag. If it can fit, wedge your Dopp kit in next to your shoes. Oh, and if you're worried about spillage, you can use plastic wrap under the lids of any liquid, cream, or gel. Now, you're gonna use the other empty half of your suitcase to start packing your clothes. Starting with your pants, roll them into tight little footballs so they fit in between those parallel bars. You're trying to create a mostly flat surface here for your shirts. Fold your shirts carefully to minimize any wrinkles. For knits like T-shirts and sweaters, I like a center fold because it creates one crease instead of two. For button-ups, I usually do the retail fold to preserve the color. If you want, you can even use cardstock squares just like they do in stores. You can see me struggling with this. Clearly, it's not something I usually do. You can also place your belts inside the collars of any shirts. This is really only necessary for like dress shirts if you really want to reduce the chance of the collar getting all wrinkled up. But honestly, for dress shirts, I always plan on doing some ironing when I get to my hotel. If you're bringing swim trunks, put them in a bag in case they're still wet when you're repacking to go home. If your swim trunks didn't come with a bag, just use a plastic bag. So put your shirts in. You might be able to fit all of them on top of your pants, or you might have to put them on both sides. Either way, you want to keep that flat plain across the top of your suitcase. So now there's going to be a couple cavities in your suitcase, probably right down the middle between the two halves, and then also between your shoes. These are perfect spots for underwear, which like your socks, should be rolled up tightly. And after packing your undies, you should end up with a relatively flat plain across your suitcase on top of which you can pack your outerwear. For lighter jackets, I'll fold them in half, maybe twice, and put them on whichever side of the suitcase has more room. If I'm bringing a heavier jacket, I'll fold it in half once, and then I'll lay it across the top of the whole suitcase, and then buckle the straps and tighten everything down. This also kind of helps lock everything in place. And that's it. This suitcase would be very easy to unpack into drawers, but given the trunk shape, it's also very easy to live out of. It's like having a compact portable dresser. Super practical, especially in a tiny hotel room. And you can even put your dirty clothes here in this mesh amenity pocket on the lid. This is my first trunk style suitcase, and in a lot of ways, it makes a lot of sense, maybe even more sense than the more common clamshell layout. So if you haven't tried a trunk and you want to give it a shot, check out Sterling Pacific. Okay, we've packed our bag, but how do you choose which clothes to bring? If you've ever forgotten to pack something important, or you brought the wrong pair of shoes on a trip, or maybe you packed six shirts, but you only wore two of them, my friend, you don't have a packing problem, you have a planning problem. Here's how to fix it. At least one week before your trip, make a packing list in your favorite note-taking app. The first time you do this, it'll be like a template. So make sure to list every single thing that you take with you when you leave town. Break it into categories like clothing, tech, and toiletries. I actually have different packing list templates for various seasons or types of trips, like going home for Christmas or a summer wedding. When you're planning for a specific trip, start with your packing list template, and then at the top, write out a brief itinerary. For example, right now I'm packing for a week-long trip to the DMV, where I grew up just to visit family. It's mostly a casual trip, just hanging out with family and friends. There will be a lot of little kids around, and I might go to one kind of nicer dinner. As you do this, go through each day in your head, and really think about and picture what you wanna be wearing. Start with your shoes and bottoms, because these are really dictated by activities. For this trip, we'll be doing a lot of walking, a lot of playing with kids, and nothing too fancy. So I'm bringing a comfortable pair of running shoes that can double as workout or hiking shoes, and a pair of slightly nicer casual shoes that these leather slip-ons that I can wear out to lunch or dinner. Now that I know the color and style of the shoes I'm bringing, it makes choosing pants and shirts much easier. To avoid overpacking, you wanna make sure that everything you're choosing works well together. In other words, all of your tops should go with all of your bottoms. In this case, I'm bringing gray chinos, off-white jeans, olive, and tan shorts. So I wanna choose shirts that can go with all of these. As much as I love gray shirts, it's not the best choice here because it doesn't really go with the gray chinos. So light blue, pink, tan, and navy are all better choices. I'm gonna bring two t-shirts, two button-ups, and a sweater, all of which can be worn with most of the bottoms that I've already chosen. It's all about maximizing interchangeability and minimizing one-off pieces. You wanna make it impossible to put together a bad outfit. If you're really struggling with this part, you could try something like the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 method. This is a carry-on-only packing method that should have you covered for at least a week. You pack five tops, four bottoms, three pairs of shoes, two accessories, and one pair of swim trunks, or if it's winter, one jacket. If you tend to overpack, a method like this can be a helpful constraint. Try on your actual outfit for each day or activity of your trip. Make sure you're happy with it. You know, make sure it works for the weather and make sure you're comfortable and that you feel good wearing it. I'll often do this part well in advance of my trip, like one or two weeks out. I tend to stress about packing and traveling in general, so doing this well in advance just helps eliminate that stress. I'll even take a quick selfie when I land on an outfit that I like just so I can remember it when I actually get to packing. So when you're happy with an outfit, either list those items in your packing list or just take a quick selfie and paste it into your note. When you're making your packing list, be as specific as possible. So don't just write sneakers, write brooks. Don't just list pants, put gray chinos. Lay everything out on the bed before putting anything in your suitcase. You wanna be able to look at your capsule wardrobe at a glance so you can refine it until it's exactly what you want. This way, you're not making any decisions when you're actually packing your bag. No refolding, no second guessing or overpacking. And finally, pack your bag just like I showed you earlier. This is the easy part. The hard work is already done. The whole goal of building a capsule wardrobe for your trip and packing efficiently is really just to reduce the stress that comes with travel. To that end, here are a few extra tips to keep in mind. Skip the neck pillows and other sleep aids. They're bulky and annoying to carry around the airport and they don't even really work. Instead, bring an eye mask and earplugs. They can fit in your Dopp kit and they actually might help you get some sleep. Don't worry about packing lunch for the airport. Just buy your food there. I know, airport food is overpriced. But the way I look at it, if I'm spending $250 or $500 or more on a plane ticket, adding another $15 to $30 for airport food isn't that big of a deal. Compared to the entire cost of your trip, it's a drop in the bucket. So don't worry about that $12 sandwich or that $10 glass of wine on the plane. It's worth it to have one last thing to think about. Weigh your bag at home. A handheld luggage scale is like $9 on Amazon. And if you buy one, you'll never have to worry about weight limits or repacking your bag at the check and counter. Buy TSA PreCheck. It comes out to like $16 a year, which is a no-brainer for most people. You can skip long lines. You can leave your shoes and laptop and liquids in your bag as you breeze through security. I also have Clear, which is worth it just to see the PreCheck people's faces as you skip to the front of their line. But if I could only choose one, I would definitely choose PreCheck. Do laundry on your trip. You know, most people never do laundry when they travel, even though it's totally possible. Most hotels offer a laundry service. Most Airbnbs have washers and dryers. You don't need a fresh outfit for every day of your trip. Just do a load of laundry. And that's everything I have to tell you about packing better and traveling more smoothly. If you have any questions for me or other tips that I missed, please leave them down in the comments section. Huge thank you again to Starling Pacific for supporting the channel. This really is an incredible carry-on, and I'm looking forward to traveling with it. If you're in the market for higher end, thoughtfully designed aluminum luggage, you should definitely go check this one out. Links below in the description. Thank you as always for watching, and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " I know, I know, another clickbaity, overly prescriptive hot take about what you should or should not wear. Let me just get something straight before we jump into the list. First off, this is just like my opinion, and I'm just some guy on the internet. Sure, I think I have pretty good taste, but taste is subjective and yours is just as valid. Second, this video is meant to be lighthearted. If you own or love to wear anything on this list, don't feel bad about it, wear what makes you happy. And for the record, I've worn many of these things in the past. Please don't take this video too seriously, and of course, feel free to fire back in the comment section. Okay, here are 10 things no man should ever wear. Number one, hybrid dress shoes. Now, I'm not talking about dress sneakers, despite the nonsensical name. I think those are actually pretty versatile. I'm talking about those dress shoes with athletic outsole. You know, dress shoes on the top, sneakers on the bottom. They are the mullet of men's footwear. Marketers tell us they can do it all, but the truth is, they do it all poorly. If you're in a situation where you need to be dressed up, these shoes are too casual. And if you're in a situation where comfort matters most, you should just wear sneakers. These Frankenstein monstrosities are the worst of both worlds. They're the corporate branded performance polo of foot coverings. They should be reserved for real estate interns, and even then, there are better options. My advice, if you want to avoid the uncanny valley of menswear, stay away from hybrid dress shoes. Number two, fake watches. Reps, dupes, fakes, homages. We're going to talk about homages in a minute. I will never understand why people buy these things. The entire benefit of wearing a Rolex is being able to look down at your wrist and instantly be able to tell that you're better than all the people around you. With the fake, you might trick other people into thinking that you're better, but deep down, you're always going to know the truth. You're a big fat fody! Obviously I'm kidding, but really, what's the point in wearing a fake luxury watch? I guess if you truly love a particular design and you'll never be able to buy the real thing, I can kind of see buying a rep or an homage. But more often than not, the guys buying fake watches are actually trying to deceive other people. Like you're essentially faking wealth to gain status, which basically makes you Tai Lopez in his garage with a rented Ferrari. What about an homage, you ask? Oh well that's not mayo, that's aioli. Watch enthusiasts seem to think that homages are some kind of loophole, but they're really no better than fakes. And that's why I'll never recommend buying an homage. You'll always just wish it was the real thing, and you'll die a little inside every time someone asks, is that a Rolex? And you have to say, no, it's a steinhart. My advice is to buy once, cry once. Save up for the watch that you actually want. Number three, performance suits. I see more and more brands offering these tech suits or travel suits that are all stretchy and wrinkle resistant and waterproof, which is to say they're made out of plastic instead of traditional suit fabrics like wool or cotton. You'll see these in Instagram ads worn way too tight on some 6-2 model doing parkour at the airport. You're trying to see the appeal, especially if you've never been comfortable in a suit and you think that the stretchy fabric will alleviate some of that discomfort? But the thing is, just like hybrid dress shoes, these suits don't make any sense. Up close, the fabric looks synthetic, like a pair of athleisure joggers. This material would be way out of place in any situation that actually calls for formal wear, like a business meeting or a wedding or a funeral. And since these suits are made from synthetic materials like polyester and spandex, they're not breathable. So even if the stretch does offer a little bit of comfort, you're almost guaranteed to overheat. And by the way, a suit that fits properly is perfectly comfortable. There's just no need for a performance suit. I'm honestly shocked that there's any demand for these things. I really wouldn't be surprised if none of these brands were around in five years. If you're going to suit up, get yourself a gently-fid wool suit and wear it with a cotton dress shirt and leather shoes. Oh, and the same goes for dress shirts. Basically any brand with an ampersand in the name, just avoid these. Get yourself a regular cotton button up. It's going to be more comfortable, more breathable, and better for the environment. Number four, hey dude shoes. Number five, v-neck t-shirts. There's not a man in the world who looks better in a v-neck than a crew-neck. Yes, Ryan Gosling included. The only time a v-neck makes sense is on a sweater worn over a button-up shirt. That's it. T-shirts, they should be crew-necks. Sweaters worn on their own, crew-necks. T-shirts had a moment sometime back in the mid-20s and they looked bad on everybody. So much so that SNL did a whole skit with Andy Sandberg and Ben Stiller making fun of them, which is hilarious by the way if you haven't seen it. So if you're thinking about buying a v-neck, don't. If you already have one, might be time to let it go. Five and a half long line tees. You know, these things. There's only one body type that these are appropriate for. Dolphins. They make your legs look shorter and they feel like you're wearing a skirt. What's the point? You don't need curves, split, or elongated hams on our t-shirts. A regular hem is just fine. Number six, shorts that go past your knees. Speaking of too long, men need to stop buying long baggy shorts. I know that fashion trends are cyclical and that long baggy shorts will probably be back in style sometime soon. Maybe they are already. I'm not really paying attention. But this is one meaningless hill that I'm going to die on. In fact, there's only one situation in which you should wear shorts that go past your knees. You're an NBA player between the years of 1997 and 2009. And if you don't belong to that group, which I know you don't because the laws of time and space, then your shorts shouldn't go past your knees. If you wear shorts like this, you're going to end up looking like a swimsuit model for Tommy Bahama. Plus, long baggy shorts don't even make sense. They're not functional. They make it harder to walk around, especially with board shorts. Once they get wet, it's just so much heavy wet fabric clinging to your legs. You know, at a certain point, you might as well just wear pants. And don't even get me started on cargo shorts. Who needs all of this leg storage? What's in those extra pockets? If you really need that much stuff, just carry a bag. Number seven, a matching tie and pocket square. If you go in any department store, you're going to see these matching tie, pocket square, box sets. You've seen these, right? They're usually part of like the Ryan Seacrest collection or something awful like that. I always wonder who buys these things. But then when I'm somewhere where people are suited up like a wedding or the bank, I see these matching sets out in the wild. It breaks my heart to say this, but they're really tacky. Your tie and your pocket square are not supposed to match exactly. They're supposed to be coordinated. That's why a plain white pocket square literally always works. It goes with any suit, shirt, tie combination. To the well-trained eye, these matching sets scream, I don't know what I'm doing. It's like leaving the tags on the sleeve of your suit jacket. Plus, you're never going to find high quality materials and craftsmanship in these box sets. They're always cheap synthetic blends with shoddy construction. So if you want to wear pocket squares, which you don't have to by the way, just get yourself one white plain pocket square and linen or cotton and wear it with literally every suit and jacket you own. Number eight, two-in-one sweaters. I can't believe these even exist, let alone that there's any demand for them. But it looks like people are actually buying these, so I had to include them on the list. To me, these are right up there with tuxedo t-shirts. They're just gimmicks. I get wanting the collared shirt under a sweater effect. I like this look. I used to wear it a lot when I worked in a business casual office during fall and winter. But these two-in-one shirts are not the way to achieve this effect. It doesn't even look right. There's something kind of off about it, and I bet it looks even worse when you actually move around. You know, it's like someone with too much Botox trying to smile. Plus, if you buy these, you're stuck with one sweater shirt combination. It's just a bad idea, and I'm sure you don't need to be told this, but please don't buy these things. Number nine is elevator shoes. Now, listen, I don't have any problem with using fashion or accessories or grooming to change your appearance. In some ways, height-increasing shoes or inserts aren't really any different than, like, hair dye or acne treatment or teeth whitening. But there is one big difference. Hair dye isn't bad for you. The problem is the shape of these elevator shoes or lifts. They create a substantial heel-to-toe drop that changes your gait and changes your posture. It puts a ton of pressure on the balls of your feet, and it can cause all sorts of foot and back problems with long-term use. Just ask any woman how she feels after a few hours wearing high heels. I bet she can't wait to take them off. Plus, I've never seen an attractive elevator shoe. They're almost all ugly. They're like these chunky orthopedic silhouettes, except for unlike orthopedic shoes, they make your feet hurt. And they're shaped this way because they have to be. They have to have that extra space to accommodate the height-increasing wedge. And the illusion doesn't even work. You can always kind of spot an elevator shoe because they just look sort of off. My advice is if you really want to stand a bit taller, just wear boots. A lot of boots have 1-2 inches built right into the heel, and they won't make you walk funny or mess with your back. Either way, please don't waste your money on height-increasing footwear products. Number 10, black dress shirts. I'm not saying that no one can pull off the black dress shirt look, but it's harder than it seems, and more often than not, I see it done incorrectly. In fact, there's only one way to nail this look consistently, and that's with a black dress shirt, no tie worn with a mid-to-light gray suit. And even that won't look good unless everything fits just right. The truth is, the vast majority of men don't need a black dress shirt in their closet. If you already have one, please don't wear it with anything red. You're going to look like a vampire on prom night. And even though you might be tempted to go with an all-black look, do not wear a black dress shirt with a black suit. If you wear this to like a wedding or formal event, it's kind of like wearing a red polo shirt to target it. You're going to look like part of the staff. If you need a dress shirt, just go with white. It will go with literally any suit or jacket that you own. This is round Sports Team Jerseys. This is a hot take, and to be fair, I've never really been into watching professional sports. Playing sports, yeah. Watching them? Not for me. I've even tried to get into it just because there's so much social pressure for men to be into sports. You know, to spend all day Sunday watching football and to be able to rattle off the stats from last week's games. To know the names and the back stories of every player on your home team. But I just can't do it. I find it all really boring. There are a million things that I'd rather be doing with my time. So maybe that's why I think that spending so much money on Sports Team at Parafinalia is kind of nuts. Like the Jerseys. These things are expensive. And I've never understood why a grown man would want to wear a shirt with another grown man's name on the back. I don't even think I'd wear a shirt with my own name on the back, let alone some other guy who I'll never meet and who has no impact on or interest in my life. I mean, you can still show your team spirit by incorporating their colors into your outfit on game day. The easiest way is just to wear a hat. But you don't have to go full blood light. Save your $130 and buy some shirts that you can wear any day and all year round. Wrapping up, I'd love to hear what you would add to this list or what you would remove. So leave a comment down below. I read every single one. I want to thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " If there's one thing these two groups of people have in common, it's New Balance. Whether you're trying to get rid of nagging metatarsal pain or throwing fits on TikTok, or a little bit of both, New Balance has something for you. And the brand is unique in its wide-ranging appeal. I mean, you don't see Rockport dropping limited edition collabs with Todd Snyder. There's something about the New Balance brand, the design language, and probably the marketing strategy that has helped it reach far beyond the running shoe market and establish itself firmly in that lifestyle category. Quick side note, thank you to my friends that were strange for sponsoring this video and for making these awesome trousers that I'm going to tell you more about in a little bit. Back to New Balance. But before all the exclusive drops, before sneakerheads and height beasts were even a thing, New Balance put in decades of research and development in order to create some of the most comfortable sneakers that money could buy. And this focus on comfort is still a huge part of the brand's DNA. It's why New Balances were the only sneakers that Steve Jobs wore. It's why podiatrists will often recommend this brand over more popular household names like Nike or Adidas. I know this because not too long ago, I was at the podiatrists trying to figure out why my feet were hurting. I never had foot pain before, I could always just wear whatever shoes I liked. I didn't need arch support insoles, I didn't even know what pronation was. But a couple years ago, I started noticing that by the end of the day, my feet were hurting. And then they started hurting in the middle of the day. Then all the time, especially in that front metatarsal area, it didn't matter what shoes I wore, they all hurt. I was like this guy, but not as good looking. It was horrible. So, I did what any red-blooded millennial would do, I asked Reddit. And one brand kept coming up over and over again, Mephisto. Just kidding, it was New Balance. Specifically, the 990 model from the brand's Maiden USA collection. Supposedly, these were the full-size luxury sedan of supportive sneakers, and they are priced accordingly at $200. I ordered the 990 V6, the latest and greatest iteration of this legendary model. And I'm going to tell you all about them right after I tell you about today's sponsor. La Strange is a London-based menswear brand that makes modular staples designed for comfort and versatility. I love both of those things. Me too. Their flagship piece, the 24-trouser, has a hidden elastic waistband and internal drawstring, so you can wear them comfortably all day without needing a belt. Belts are overrated. Too true. Maiden Europe from Regenerative Cotton. These come in a bunch of different colors and two different fits, slim and relaxed. The slim fit follows the shape of your leg, but it's by no means skinny or tight. The relaxed fit is almost straight. It just has a subtle taper down to the leg opening. Both fits are meant to be rolled to the perfect length, and I love this because I like to customize the length of my pants depending on what shoes I'm wearing. In this case, I prefer a slight or no break because with the relaxed fit of the trousers and the chunky sneakers, I just think it looks good. And these really are do-it-all pants. You can wear them to a big meeting at the office. You could go wine tasting with your friends. You could wear them on a date to an art gallery. Who am I kidding? I wear these at home. I have been wearing the 24-trouser for a couple of years now, and I really enjoy them. So if you want to check them out for yourself, I will link to these along with any discounts down below in the description. Okay, back to the video. The first time I put on the 990s, I could tell that they were built for comfort. But it wasn't until I wore them for a few days and then tried going back to my old shoes that I could really tell the difference. Like my old shoes just were not comfortable. Honestly, I don't think I'll wear most of these ever again other than two pairs that I'll talk about later. These 990 V6s are not like an Ultra Boost. They're not super squishy. They do have a little bit of give under your foot, but mostly they just feel supportive. Like there aren't any pressure points that are going to build up and get worse throughout the day. They're also roomy enough to accommodate any kind of socks or insoles. I've been wearing them with these Superfeet medium-arch cushioned insoles, which are much softer than your standard Superfeet insoles. And my feet are feeling pretty good. But even without insoles, these are still more comfortable than pretty much all of my other shoes. Speaking of which, let's talk about my older shoes. I still wear some of them. Like these Court sneakers from Alan Edmonds. I like these because they're a bit roomier and more comfortable than other minimalist low tops like Common Projects. But they're also more premium than like a Stan Smith or Air Force One. Also wear these Adams, which are a lot narrower and more squishy than the Alan Edmonds. These are pretty dirty as you can see. I've actually tried to clean them and it didn't work. So if you don't like dirty shoes, maybe don't buy these in white. But they have this very soft knit upper. So they're very wearable even though they're pretty snug. I also put a rigid carbon fiber insole in these, which makes the whole shoe less bendy. So it takes some pressure off the balls of your feet when you walk. According to one podiatrist, this is good for my feet. Unfortunately, none of my boots have removable insoles. Even the high end ones like Grant Stone, Yucatan, I guess it's just a boot thing. But it kind of sucks because I really can't wear these right now. In fact, there's only one other pair of shoes that I'm wearing a lot right now that are just as comfy as the 990s. Mephisto. Just kidding. These are the Adrenaline. These are the Adrenaline GTS23s. They're just the latest model that were available when I made the purchase. I've actually had several pairs of Brooks in the past, specifically the Ghost, which is like a more minimal running shoe. But these Adrenaline are much better for my arched feet and my pronated gait. I also think these actually look pretty good for Brooks. I feel like they just kind of got this color way right. And just like with the 990s, I can wear these with an archer port insole. They have plenty of room, super comfortable with pretty much any type of insole. But they're also very comfortable right out of the box. So throughout the week, I'm alternating between Brooks and New Balance, sometimes even in the same day. And then if I want to dress it up a little bit, I'll wear the Allen Edmonds. And that brings me to our last point, style. I get that 990s or New Balance in general isn't for everybody. Some people really don't like this aesthetic. I'm actually really liking it and I think I'm going to buy more of these in the future. But they are chunky, maximalist dad shoes. They look good with slightly more relaxed outfits. I wouldn't try to wear these with skinny jeans. They're also pretty casual. I wouldn't try to dress these up too much. Luckily for me, casual is all I wear these days. And they're definitely more versatile than the Brooks. You know, the Brooks are very athletic looking. I mean, they're modern running shoes after all. They look awesome with sweats and a crew neck, really any athleisure type outfit, but I wouldn't wear them with jeans. But I am still hunting for comfortable but slightly less sporty, slightly less casual footwear options. Maybe something like a Birkenstock Boston. I don't really know. But I know that right now comfort is my top priority and the 990s and these Brooks are working out really well. I want to thank Lestrange again for sponsoring this video, supporting the channel. I will link to the 24Trouzer down below in the description along with any discount codes. If you have any suggestions for other comfortable shoe brands or models that I should check out, please drop them in the comments below. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " It's been a little bit over 10 years since I posted my first FitPick to the internet. I said FitPick. I wasn't trying to be an influencer. In fact, when I started, Instagram didn't even exist, let alone TikTok. I was just documenting my style journey on this thing called a blog, which trigger warning to my Gen Z viewers. It's like a website with a lot of words on it that you actually have to read. Eventually, I started teaching other guys what I was learning, not as a fashion expert, more as a curious beginner. Over the course of about a decade, I ended up writing hundreds of articles and posting hundreds of videos and countless photos, creating a sort of unintentional timeline of my personal style journey. In this video, I'm going to look back at some of these fits and give you my honest reaction and critique. Real quick, I want to thank today's sponsor, Grahams28, who makes simple, functional, and luxurious leather accessories. But first, let's kick things off with one of my first Fits. We got to go way back, way back even further. All right, maybe that's a little too far back, but honestly, this one goes pretty hard. I think it's going to be all downhill from here. Okay, starting in 2013, I remember this. This is one of the first times I did like a photo shoot. My girlfriend took this picture and she had like a real camera and everything. And I was just so awkward. This is in my neighborhood in Silver Spring, Maryland. The actual fit, not bad. I used to wear this kind of thing to my office job all the time. This shirt was like my first custom made to measure shirt from a brand that's not around anymore. It's actually super nice and it fit really well. I would still wear this exact shirt. Dumb haircut, dumb smile. I don't like this. Clothes don't fit well. I've got those dad jeans. Awkward smile, dumb haircut. This is a bad idea. This whole video is a bad idea. Okay, this one, the thing I don't like about this fit is that cardigan just doesn't really make sense over like a button up shirt and that jacket like kind of mismatched and colors aren't great. Whatever, I was figuring it out. Okay. This is still in 2013. My first made to measure suit, Dragon Inside, which is now Oliver Wicks. It's pretty fitted, but actually I wore this suit not that long ago to a wedding and it still fits really well. So I think this is a pretty solid fit actually. I remember this tie. Yeah, there's the back. This tie from Fort Belvedere with the pheasants on it. I really like that tie. I still have it. Okay, another kind of business casual. I used to wear this kind of thing a lot when I worked in an office job. Just kind of like button up shirt, trousers, sometimes a jacket. This jacket actually fit really well. I got it altered. These pants, I really like these shoes actually from a German brand called shoe passion. I would wear different color socks. I feel like those socks kind of break up the outfit a little bit and you know, polka dot shirt, it's not really for me. It's from this Italian brand called Galliardi. You could see that I'm not feeling it. I'm not feeling it at all. I'm embarrassed. Okay, this one sucks. This outfit actually isn't terrible. This is kind of like a template that you'll see a lot over the next few years. It's like using this lightweight vest as a middle layer and then wearing like a medium weight jacket, like a field jacket, chinos, boots, and then a Hanley. Actually don't hate this. The fingerless gloves. Yeah, I'm not sure about those. Don't really make sense because they don't keep your hands warm. I feel like the touch gloves didn't exist back then or something. This is like the first pair of jeans that I really fell in love with. It was from Express. Very stretchy, not high quality denim, but and then these J. Crew McAllister boots, which I wore for many, many years. I did actually two versions of this outfit. I like this one better. I feel like the bag and the loafers with the pop of yellow actually still like that. I'd probably just get these jeans hemmed instead of wearing them cuffed like that with the loafers, but I don't hate this fit. Cheesy smile. You'll see this pose a lot. I don't know. I just started grabbing my glasses like that and I just like used that pose all the time, which it's kind of corny, but I had a pretty good haircut back then. This is a camel top coat from Van Republic, black pants, black shoes. And then I remember this like Scottish brand, I think sent me this cashmere vest. It was kind of like a wild vest. And back then I was like, I didn't want to wear it because it was like too much. Now I think I would appreciate that vest a little more. I'd probably wear it more. Okay. And then this outfit again, this template you'll see a lot. This lightweight quilted vest is a middle layer, handling as a base layer, and then like a leather field jacket outside, jeans with boots. This leather jacket doesn't fit very well. It's too big, but I kind of do like this template and then a scarf. Again, with those fingerless gloves, not too sure about that, but I did get a lot of wear out of that scarf. And I still wear a scarf a lot of the time too. What would make this outfit better is a nice bag like this city sling from Grahams 28. A modern take on the messenger bag, this five and a half liter cross body sling is made from environmentally friendly certified full grain pebbled Italian leather. I consider this and everything but the laptop bag. It has a low profile, but it holds a ton of stuff. It can accommodate consoles like the Nintendo Switch or the Steam Deck, a small tablet like the iPad mini, and even a compact camera like a DSLR mirrorless. For me, it holds all of my EDC gear, which frees up my pockets. And for all my fellow dads out there, I think this could serve as a small diaper bag. It could definitely fit a few diapers, some wipes, and some snacks. My favorite thing about this bag is just how premium it feels. The pebbled leather is durable and soft. The strap and the buckle is surprisingly heavy duty for a bag this compact and this luxurious feeling. It's a very comfortable bag to wear. The cross body format and the exterior pockets make for easy access without having to take it off. The interior is thoughtfully designed. It has plenty of organization built right in for things like your pen or your iPad pen or an air tag, your phone, really anything sensitive like your passport or cash or wallet. I've tried a lot of bags from many different leather goods brands, popular ones and ones that are lesser known. And I have to say, this city sling from Grams28 feels top of the line. I expect it to age like top shelf bourbon. I will link to this bag in the description below and in the pinned comment. I want to thank Grams28 again for supporting the channel. Definitely go check them out. Okay, moving on. Grabbing the glasses again. Here we go. This is a color combo that I would end up wearing a lot. Actually, I still wear, you know, it's basic, but I think this is a decent fit, you know, for an office job or something like that. And this camel top coat again goes well with those colors. Get a nice simple fit. A little more casual now. I would still wear this. I think the only thing I would change is the shoes. I don't really wear like boat shoes too much anymore. So I'd probably just put on some sneakers or something with that or maybe some loafers. Probably also swap out this bag for something from my friends at Grams28. All right, this is another suit from Oliver Wicks. Also custom. It's like a brown, like worsted flannel. And I really like it. I think these colors work well together. I like the yellow socks, like that pheasantie from Fort Belvedere, which is Gentleman's Gazette brand. All right, this, this one's kind of lame. So I didn't really understand camera angles back then. So I had the camera like way up above kind of looking down, which makes you look weird. It makes your head look big and makes you look shorter. So I do like this template of like a button up shirt with shorts. I would wear that a lot. And yeah, it's not bad. And the fashion watch, I would swap those out. But otherwise, all right, it's not a terrible fit. Yeah, okay, it's basic, but it's fine. What I do like about this is I like the colors blue and gray. They always work well together. Pretty timeless. I mean, this one is from 2016 and I think it still looks fine. V-neck t-shirts, just go with the crew neck, you know, unless you're like super jacked or something. These J crew McAllister boots, I would wear those a lot. Really like those boots. Good casual pair of chakas. And then these were actually decent jeans. I can't remember where they're from, but they look a lot better than those old express jeans. Another kind of wintery business casual fit. Again, I would wear this thing, this, this type of fit to work all the time. Actually, like this one. I had this charcoal top coat from Banana Republic and these kind of taupe trousers from some made to measure company. All right, this one's from Indochino. I believe this was for a sponsored post. I don't have this suit anymore. There's a little two out there for me, but you know, it's purple. I think they call it a burgundy, but it's pretty purple. I will say the fit's pretty good and black and burgundy or purple, whatever look really good together. It's not really me. This is not something I feel comfortable in, but I think it looks okay. This watch, the fifth. They were like the one of the first brands that like really sponsored my channel. And I remember just being thrilled that I had a sponsor, but obviously my taste in watches has evolved a bit and I don't have this one anymore. I do still have those shoes, those just black oxfords from Ace Marks. And those are my go-to for any formal events. All right, another custom suit. It's funny. I don't wear suits now, but I used to, you know, do all these reviews of these custom suit brands. So I had a bunch of suits. I still have a few. This one is Olive Tweed from Olive for Wix again. Actually, I like this fit, you know, dorky pose, but a decent haircut this time at least. And I think the tie and the pocket square and everything is pretty well coordinated. Those old trusty Allen Edmonds Park Avenue shoes. I'm actually still a fan of this outfit. Side tabs, of course. Look at the detail on that Tweed. That's so nice. Yeah, I gotta say, decent fit. Okay, this is another custom suit. What do you know? This is an unstructured suit. It is, man, also from Olive Wix. I feel like I should sponsor this video or something, but no, Grahams 28 is the sponsor. And thank you Grahams 28. I'm wearing suspenders in this one. This was actually, we did this photo shoot at Hamilton Distillers, which is like a whiskey distillery here in Tucson. This bag is from David. These double monks also from Olive Wix. I still have those, got a lot of wear out of them. Yeah, I still wear that suit, still use that bag, have those shoes. I still have those glasses. So, you know, a lot of this stuff hasn't changed that much in the last, whatever, it's been five years since these pictures and I still have all that stuff. All right, so this picture, I think this got picked up on like some meme accounts for like, you know, like white guys after the one leaf drops or something and, you know, guilty. It's kind of a funny picture, but yeah, this basic template of like the lightweight vest over a button-up shirt, jeans and boots and like a fuel jacket. I think it works, you know, I think it's pretty timeless. I think it still looks good today. Maybe like a little rugged for my taste now, but blue, green and gray and brown. It just, you know, the stuff doesn't really go out of style, even though silhouettes and everything has changed a lot in the last few years. Okay, so this, this is the first picture in this collection that I feel like is really like representative of my current style. It's like very neutral, olive green tan, you know, wearing these minimalist like leather white sneakers, which I think I still have these. They're all beat up now, but I got so much wear out of that style of sneaker. Nice haircut. What was this? 2018. This is in Tucson. Yeah, it's just solid. This bag, I got the Hamilton Kaki watch. Obviously my watch game has improved a lot since wearing the fifth. It was a great watch, that little Hamilton Kaki mechanical. I would still wear this exact same thing. I would still wear this too, actually. This is like around the same time, 2018. I still have this windbreaker. I have these shorts, I have very similar shoes. I lost the sunglasses, unfortunately. Steco SKX013, great little dive watch for smaller wrists. Solid outfit, no complaints there. Okay, again, I like this outfit too. The only thing I would change about this outfit is the shoes. I don't really wear like boat shoes anymore, so I would just wear sneakers with this. I think it would be improved. I will say that the dark blue shoes go well with this dark floral shirt, but I think like plain sneakers or suede or leather, whatever, will look better with this. And then I've got that vintage Datejust. Ooh, wearing it right now. The shirt was very cheap. It was from some, it's like ASOS or something. And I got rid of it because it didn't feel good to wear, but I do like the way it looked. And then nice accessories. Yeah, not bad. I still wear this exact outfit today. It's just like a pale pink t-shirt, Kaki Chino shorts, basic accessories, white sneakers. I think I still have most of this stuff, actually. And again, that Hamilton Kaki mechanical. So this, I was trying to wear these black sneakers, which I had never had a pair of black sneakers before. I don't think it really works. And it's not really me. Like I don't really wear that color scheme, but I remember just trying it out. And I do still have this bag carry it all the time. And I do wear a lot of like gray t-shirts. I will say F-84W from Casio. Great little watch. I still wear that all the time. All right, this was taken by Mark, Moved by Mark on Instagram. Really good photographer up in New York. Basic business casual fit. I remember getting these olive green driving mocks from, I think the brand is called Bobby. And they're pretty cool with olive green chinos. I will say the chinos are a little slim. I probably, I think those were from Uniqlo. I ended up getting rid of them because they were actually a little too skinny. You know, overall color scheme of this outfit, I think it's pretty nice. All right, this is kind of like an athleisure type thing. Actually, I remember wearing this outfit and taking these pictures. I just got a new camera and I was just like taking some test shots outside of my old office. I feel like I would wear this today. Like I wasn't super comfortable in it back then, but this is like exactly something that I would wear now because I'm wearing a lot more like comfortable clothes since I'm chasing kids around more. My kids, not just random kids, but I actually like this. I like the green, tan, blue, white color combination. I think everything fits pretty well. Yeah, not bad. I don't know what the umbrella is for. It's not raining. Again, simple summer outfit. I wear this exact same thing today. Dark gray t-shirt, navy blue, chino shorts that hit like above the knee, they're probably six or seven inches. White and minimalist sneakers, couple of easy accessories. It just works well. It's like a good template. And also, I miss this watch, this gray dial Rolex Oyster Perpetual 34 millimeter, I think 5,000 maybe is the reference number. Great little watch. Yeah, this one is pretty decent too. I think those are those unique lochinos again. And again, you know, basic outfit, like it's nothing special. You're not going to win any awards for an outfit like this. And I think this kind of outfit would still look fine. I would still wear it. Let me just rant for a second. I think people like to say there's no such thing as a timeless wardrobe, but like if an outfit looks just as good five years later, that's pretty timeless. Like that's timeless enough for me. It doesn't have to last a thousand years, you know what I mean? So rant over. I think this is a solid fit. So I remember getting this fleece from unique low and trying to use it in a bunch of different ways. I don't think the South really works for a few reasons. I guess props for trying like a unique layering combination or something. Yeah, the colors don't really work. Maybe a little too much blue and green. I think it just needs something else going on there. I do like the kind of mixed materials like the flannel and the fleece and the quilted vest. I think it's sort of a nice mix of materials. Something about the South, it doesn't really work. I will say I miss these shoes from Grace. These were the greats pronto before the company got bought by Steve Madden. And yeah, they were nice. I don't know what happened to them. Nice simple business casual fit. Got the button up and the vest, the raincoat, the trousers, those double monks that we saw earlier, portfolio. I like this. I'd wear it today if I had the occasion to. I don't go into an office anymore. So I never wear stuff like this, but I still think that this is a pretty good fit. All right, so I was trying to get more to like rug the rugged aesthetic. And so I was trying to wear like flannels over hand leaves with the vest and more like rugged layers like that. I'll talk about that a little later, but I think that this is a decent fit. It's not really for me like, like even like the baseball cap, like I just, it's a cool hat, but I don't look good in it. Like, and I don't feel good in baseball caps. I never have. So I can appreciate this outfit, but like I wouldn't wear it today. I would wear those greats. I wish I still had those. I would wear that watch. I wish I still had it. This is a pretty cool outfit. Actually I like this one button up shirt, chinos, brown sneakers and a Harrington. Not sure about that bag. It's kind of, it doesn't really go with this outfit. I remember these shoes, I could never figure out how to style these shoes. They look good in this outfit, but I could never figure out how to wear them with other outfits and ended up getting rid of them. I just find lighter color shoes much easier to style. There's the vintage date just again. I saw that belt. It's actually kind of a fun little embroidered belt. All right. So black and green, I had these faded black jeans from Everlane and I was just trying to figure out ways to style them. And I still, I've worn black and green as a combo a lot. I think it's a really good combination, especially with like a faded black. I love a long sleeve polo and like a extra fine merino wool. And these shoes, these shoes were not comfortable. They looked really cool, but they were not comfortable and I ended up getting rid of them. I think they work really well with this outfit. All right. This one I really like. Man, I used to have this like epic longer hair and it was such a pain. Like it was so hard to shower and to take care of and to style, but yeah, I like this combo of like a casual kind of crew neck pullover over a casual button up and you leave it untucked. So it just has this very like effortless kind of carefree look. I like the South, but I think I'd probably still wear something like this. I still like that color combination of blue and brown. New York is so photogenic. Like you can just take any picture there. It just looks cool. It's funny. I remember posting this to Instagram and this one got a lot of likes. Like people were like asking about the pants and stuff, but actually I don't really like this outfit that much. I feel like the shirt doesn't fit that well and the pants are just, they're fine. They're like beige linen pants. And yeah, I don't really know why people liked that one so much. This is a Hanley that I, it was too long and I ended up hemming it myself and you can see the hem is kind of janky, but I was like proud of my work. So I wanted to take this picture. I've got those olive chinos from unique logo again. These gats from Beckett's Simonin. They ended up replacing with the real thing, Margiela gats. This is fine. You know, it's a little too tight. Like the shirt's a little too tight, which looks good in pictures maybe, but it's not actually that comfortable. I ended up getting rid of this shirt, but I do like that color combination. It's a combination that I still wear. All right. This is also up in New York. Very kind of basic, smart, casual. Got that black watch plaid shirt, brown sweater, darker brown jacket, blue jeans, lighter, kind of camel, Chelsea boots. I think it's, I think it's a really nice, you know, color combination, middle-aged guy fit a little bit, but I guess I'm kind of into that. I saw those glasses. I've had those glasses for, I don't know, seven or eight years and I still wear them. They're great. I like these things, just the sunglasses and I just, I just liked this picture. I remember taking these pictures with my friend, Baron, aka Effortless Gent, who runs a great website and YouTube channel if you haven't seen it yet. There's that charcoal topcoat from Banana Republic from years ago and I still have this. Like some pieces, I mean, they can last a decade or longer. I'll probably never get rid of this jacket. It's just, it's so versatile and it fits well and it's held up over the years and it has this kind of middle, like, sort of vest built in and it's like a high collar. It's just so cool. Yeah, sunglasses, scarf, Chelsea boots. Not a bad fit. Again, in New York, this one was taken by my friend Justin Jeffers, who runs J Butler. It makes probably the best loafers for the price. Everlane, reversible puffer jacket, cashmere scarf, wool cashmere scarf, something like that and then these made well jeans with these greats high tops. I still wear stuff like this all the time, like a casual crew neck, a lightweight jacket and lighter wash jeans with sneakers. Yeah, you really can't go wrong. I love those sneakers. They actually ended up being a little too narrow for me, so I couldn't wear them for that long, but if they made them in a wide size, I would definitely get them. All right, again, 2019, still in New York. I got these tobacco colored chinos, these Grant Stone boots and this Patagonia Parker. It's actually youth-sized, extra small and it fits me basically perfectly. So I guess in Patagonia's eyes, I'm like a 16-year-old boy. I love that Parker though and I think the gloves and the boots are a little too matchy, but otherwise I think this is a fine, okay fit. Again, New York, so photogenic. All right, this picture actually shout out to John from Forty Over Fashion. He took this picture. He's such a good photographer. It makes me look cool. I do like this. I would still probably wear this, although I haven't really been tucking in my shirts as much these days, but this is a lightweight jacket from Banana Republic. Their core template, which I don't even know if that's still around, t-shirts from Everlane, chinos are from Everlane, and then these Coyo sneakers. I love it. I love the way tan and gray looks together. Such a cool combination. Still wear it all the time. All right, and this is 2020. This was shortly before I moved away from New York. This was taken by Jeff. Oh man, how do you say his name? Juan Cristiano. I've been lucky to get my picture taken by some very talented photographers who know how to make me look good because I'm not a great model. I'm very awkward in front of the camera, but I do remember this day in this outfit, this kimono style jacket sweater from Akashi Kama. Everything else is Everlane except for the sneakers, and then that little Seiko 5 watch. Yeah, same day, just without the kimono with my buddy Eric and carrying a little black tote bag, which I feel like the tote bag is underrated. It's a very useful bag format. Yeah, and again, Jeff just takes such a cool picture. It's a very basic outfit, but the picture is really nice. Casual button-up, chinos, sneakers, again, something I would wear today. The shirt is maybe a little slim for my taste today, but it does look good in pictures, and then there's kind of a combination of those two fits with the button-up with the Nouragi style jacket over the shirt. Yeah, it's kind of gray and blue tones, and I think it's pretty nice. This is from a video I did with Everlane, and I was talking about color schemes. This is like a monochromatic color scheme. It's all brown and cream and tan, so it's basically monochromatic brown. It's a pretty good outfit for the video, to be honest. I don't really wear something like this in everyday life, because having a hemly and then a heavy flannel, it's just too warm for where I live, so I would never really wear this sort of thing now. But I do think these colors work, and it's a cool fit in that way. This was also for that same video. Actually, we like these shoes. These were from Everlane. They're kind of yellow, and they were too big, so I didn't keep them after this video, but I would totally wear shoes in that color. I ended up keeping that jacket for years. I still have it. I just wore it the other day. The little neck handkerchief scarf thing. I remember Everlane was selling those maybe during the pandemic, and I'd never really wore it, because it didn't really serve any purpose. You could put it up your face, but I felt like a bank robber, so I never really wore it. But yeah, I would still wear an outfit like this. So this was a post that I did about the Margiela German Army trainers. I really like this fit, actually. This wash of jeans is kind of medium wash with a cream, crew neck, sweater, got the Rolex Explorer, and then the Margiela Gats. This is probably the most expensive outfit I've ever worn. It actually feels a little ridiculous, but I do kind of like just the simple basic fit. That's the Acne Studios, which is pricey stuff, but high quality. And then Gucci jeans, which I actually didn't even keep these because they were a little too tight around the hips, but I also just felt ridiculous with that giant Gucci tag. Like, come on. All right, this is for a suit supply review that I did. So head to toe suit supply, except for the shoes are Oliver Wicks. Yeah, I've worn this suit to several weddings. It's one of my best fitting suits, actually. I like the kind of warm gray brown textured fabric. It's like a wool, silk, linen blend. I actually don't wear it as a three piece too often because I'll just overheat, but I did wear it to a cooler weather wedding once and wore the vest and it worked. Here's another kind of rugged outfit. And I really probably wouldn't wear this today. It's like a little too rugged with the Hanley and the flannel and the leather jacket and the boots and everything. It was kind of fighter piloty. You know, it's a good outfit just for somebody else. Now this is something that I would totally wear today because it's like more subdued and neutral and kind of simple, minimalist. I think this was also for an Everlane video. I still have most of this stuff and I would still wear this exact outfit. All right, this was for LL Bean. I did a little mini photo shoot for them. I really like this outfit. I really like these colors. Still have these shoes and socks. The vest was actually a little big. I like the color of it and the feel, but it didn't really fit me well. So I had to part ways with it, but I do like this color scheme. You know, it feels a little traditional preppy, but I think it kind of works. All right. And here is another one, more recent 2022. Yeah, kind of basic cream colored pants. Those suede sneakers from Alan Edmonds, which I still have and wear regularly. They're some of my most comfortable sneakers. This jacket was from Billy Reed. It was actually kind of too long and the sleeves need to be shorter than everything. So I ended up keeping it, but nice jacket and then just blue Oxford, which I still wear a lot. Another basic fit that I totally wear now. These slip-ons were from greats. They're all beat up, but I actually still have them, you know, gray, green, tan, cream. These colors are pretty timeless. Another simple kind of summer fit. Blue, are these corduroy? None is just chino. Chino shorts. These slippers are from Del Toro and a knit polo. Knit polos. I like the way they look, but they're not practical because if you're wearing a polo, it means it's pretty hot outside and a knit polo is kind of warm. So it's kind of like a short sleeve sweater, which I don't think makes any sense. So you know, I like the way this one looks. It's from Buck Mason, but I never wear it. All right. This is from a suit supply video. I was just testing out like the turtleneck under a button up. Again, not really for me. It's a little warm and not really my style. I was just kind of trying it out. This works on other people. I've seen like Ethan Wong does this a lot and he looks really cool. I do like the corduroy's with sneakers. Another suit supply fit. This one reminds me of like something you'd see on like articles of style, like the knit polo with no buttons on the placket and the casual sport coat and the, you know, the wool trousers, the black tassel loafers. Pretty cool fit actually. I'd probably wear this like a holiday party or something. I like the medium wash jeans. Got those loafers again. This overcoat fits really well. I still have that one. And then the turtleneck. If I didn't live in Arizona, I'd probably wear something like this. And then I think I was just trying to show like a smart casual fit from suits supply. So I do still, I had the sport coat. I wear it a lot. And then, you know, great chinos, sneakers. This is kind of a basic monochromatic fit. I don't really have the occasion to wear something like this very often, but I think if you work in like a smart casual office or if you want to just dress it up a little bit going somewhere a little fancy, I think this would make sense. I do think the outfit works. This one maybe feels a bit too rugged. I remember that vest. I really liked it, but it was just like a little too big for me or something, a little too long. Something didn't feel right about it. And this outfit, I have worn this exact outfit too, just like out to like, you know, fancy wintery events. Sport coat over a turtleneck is like, it's so much better than a button up for like wintery stuff. So I do like that outfit. And then same thing with the wool cashmere overcoat. Nice. That was a good outfit. Actually, I liked that one. Okay. And then getting to the end here, we are in 2023 in June. This is for a video I did for Nomos. I wore this exact outfit a lot last summer. I really like it. It's kind of casual. Short sleeve is from Uniclo from their heat tech line. Chino shorts, those slip-ons again. Nice watch, sunglasses. And again, I wore this outfit all the time. Just short sleeve or a long sleeve, casual button up with the sleeves rolled up. Chino shorts, slip-ons. This is like my go-to for like going out to eat during the summertime or something. So I got those Nomos watches. So going through these old outfits was actually a really fun exercise, if not a bit narcissistic. And I think there were a few key takeaways. One is the right piece of clothing can serve you well for many years. For example, the quilted vest, my minimalist white sneakers, these Orbee Parker sunglasses. These showed up in a bunch of different fits over the course of a decade. So if you think about price in terms of cost per wear, I think that these were all excellent purchases. Takeaway number two is that certain outfit recipes showed up again and again. And this created a kind of personal uniform that made getting dressed a lot easier. For example, I started using a lightweight vest as a middle layer back in like 2014. And I kept doing that over the years. You know, like a Henley vest jacket or a long sleeve polo vest jacket or a button up vest overcoat. This recipe served me well for a long time. Takeaway number three is that some styles just didn't feel right. Like looking back, I used to dress much more preppy, but over the years I found myself gravitating toward sneakers instead of boat shoes and t-shirts instead of polos. It's not that I don't like the preppy look. I actually love that aesthetic just on other people. And it's the same thing with rugged fits. Like I would try to pull off these rugged fits and I think that the outfits looked good, but I just didn't feel like they represented me. So I'd wear like a flannel shirt over a Henley with a leather jacket and boots and you know, someone else would look great in that, but it just didn't feel authentic. So over the years I've moved away from those rugged and preppy looks and really gone for more of like, you know, the minimal aesthetic. And this feels like a more authentic representation of my personality, at least for now. And finally, takeaway number four, the only constant is change. You know, I remember falling in love with the Hamilton and Kaki mechanical watch and I didn't wear any other watches for like a year. And then eventually I started craving my old SKX-013, you know, and then I got this vintage Datejust and this is all I wore for like a year and a half. And I went back to an old cheap Casio. I've parted ways with jeans that were too skinny or jackets that were too big. I've seen a lot of jeans that seemed like the right color, but eventually felt wrong. Preferences are weird, you know, they change. I never really 100% trust my current taste because I know that in a year or five years or definitely 10 years, they're going to be different. And that's a good thing. You know, it keeps things interesting, but that doesn't mean that you have to change or that you should be trying to actively evolve your style. If you're happy with your wardrobe and your current fits, that's fine. Stick with them regardless of what's trendy. I would love to hear from you. How has your style evolved over the last five or 10 years? Let me know down in the comment section. Thank you to Grims28 again for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " If you can think of a skincare brand for men, I've probably tried it. All the drugstore mainstays like Clearacell and Cereve, all of the fancy direct-to-consumer startups like Lumen and Tish Hamley and Geology, and even the department store favorites like Kiehl's and Jack Black. I've tried them all. And to be honest, I like a lot of these brands. I'm currently using a Tish Hamley face wash, geology moisturizer and Jack Black deodorant. But I'm not loyal to anyone brand or even anyone product. And that's because I have learned something over the years, something very important that has transformed the way my skin looks and the way that I shop for skincare products. It's a lesson that most people don't consider, and it's definitely something that skincare brands and marketers don't want you to know, or at least they don't really want us thinking about it. And that lesson is, when it comes to finding skincare products that actually make you look better, it's not about the brand, it's not about the products, it's not even about the supposed benefits. When you're evaluating a skincare product, the only thing that matters is the ingredients, specifically the active ingredient. For example, let's say a face wash claims to be all natural and formulated just for men with anti-aging properties and paraben free and blah, blah, blah. But you have acne. That face wash is not necessarily going to clear up your skin, unless it contains acne fighting ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoperoxide or certain retinoids. The rest of the ingredients, that long list of ingredients you see on a lot of all natural products, stuff like pomegranate seed oil and rosemary extract and non-GMO aloe vera, all that stuff that promotes healthy skin. Yeah, that stuff doesn't do anything. You need active ingredients that are scientifically proven to do the specific thing you need, like clearing up acne or reducing wrinkles. And yeah, these ingredients are mostly chemicals and they're man-made and they work. Now the good news is if you know the ingredient that you're looking for, the brand doesn't really matter and you'll often get just as much mileage out of the more affordable brands as you will from the higher end designer brands. It's kind of like Cheerios versus Toasted O's. Sure, they might taste or smell a little bit different, but they're made from the exact same raw materials and they will give you the exact same benefits. The price difference usually just comes down to branding. Now for me and for millions of other people, there is one class of active ingredients that has been a game changer that has had a huge impact on the way my skin looks. It will literally make you look younger and it might even clear up your acne for good. This class of ingredients is called retinoids. Now you've probably heard of retinol, which is the most popular retinoid used in skincare products. This stuff works to reduce wrinkles. It's widely used as a safe and effective way to make you look younger. If you've never tried retinol, it really might be a game changer for you. And I'll talk about how exactly to incorporate it into your skincare routine in a minute. But first, you have to understand that retinol does not clear up your acne. If you have acne, you're gonna wanna use a different type of retinoid called a dapeline. This does everything that retinol does, but it also fights acne and you can get it without a prescription. For me, incorporating a dapeline into my skincare routine literally changed the way my skin looks forever. It's had a more obvious impact on my skin than salicylic acid, benzoperoxide, or any all-natural ingredient from all of the fancy higher end brands that I've tried. Simply put, I don't really get bad acne anymore. I mean, yeah, I still get the occasional blemish, funny timing that I have one today while I'm making this video, but it's not that bad and it doesn't last a long time. It goes away quickly. I used to get bad acne and you can see it in my old videos. Even when I was a young guy like 10 years ago, I would get acne that was bad enough that it made me wanna call in sick to work. You know, it was embarrassing. And it would stick around for a week or two weeks or even longer. But yeah, I just don't get that anymore. So before I tell you how to incorporate these ingredients into your skincare routine, let's quickly recap what we've talked about because I know this can be a lot. One, when buying skincare products, pay attention to the active ingredients and ignore everything else. Two, if you're not happy with your skin or your current skincare routine and you've never tried retinoids, you should try them. Three, retinoids are a class of active ingredients used in skincare products for their anti-aging properties. Four, retinol is a common type of retinoid used in a variety of skincare products and it works for most people. And five, adapylene is another type of retinoid that not only reduces wrinkles and has those anti-aging properties, but it also fights acne. So now that all that is clear, let's talk about how to incorporate these ingredients into your skincare routine. First, don't wait until you look old, okay? You can start using this stuff in your mid to late 20s. Second, you're gonna wanna ease into topical retinoids. Start with a low concentration like 0.1 or 0.3% and use it every two to three days until your skin adapts. Third, you should use retinoids at night because some of them can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and some are rendered less effective by sunlight. So for example, in the morning, use a moisturizer with SPF 30 and then at night put on a thin layer of retinol cream or adapylene gel after you've rinsed and washed your face. And finally, be patient. It can take a couple of weeks to start noticing the effects of topical retinoids and they're subtle at first. For some people, their skin gets a little worse before it gets better. You might notice a bit of redness or dry irritated skin. This is normal and it's temporary. But once you see the results, you're gonna wanna keep using this stuff. Like I said, I still get the occasional pimple or blemish, but it's nothing like the type of severe, very noticeable breakouts that I used to get. I also noticed how much smoother and more even my skin looks just after using adapylene gel for one or two nights in a row. So wrapping up, here's my advice for you. Treat your skincare products like food. Ignore the brands, ignore the marketing, ignore the hype and the price. Instead, keep an eye on ingredients, especially the active ingredients. If you haven't tried topical retinoids, I highly recommend them. Look for a night moisturizer or an anti-aging cream with retinol. And if you do have acne and you've tried other things like salicylic acid and benzoperoxide, try adapylene gel. In fact, I will link to the exact adapylene gel that I use in the description below and in a pinned comment. Telling you this is gonna have a more substantial impact on your skin than all of the organic, sulfate-free, fancy pants, designer stuff that you see on Instagram ads. These ingredients transform my skin. And more importantly, this idea of looking at ingredients instead of branding and supposed benefits, I think is just the right way to evaluate skincare products, especially today when there's just so much marketing and so many ads and so much hype. And to be honest, a lot of nonsense. If you have any questions about any of this, leave them down below in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " One of my favorite all-time t-shirts is Uniqlo's Supima Cotton Crewneck. The size extra small fits me really well. These things are durable, they're 100% cotton, and they're just $20 to $25, so very fairly priced. Of course, they don't last forever. I noticed that mine were getting kind of ratty, so I headed over to Uniqlo.com to buy some new ones. But I saw that they have so many different t-shirts now. Dry Color, Aerizm, Uniqlo U, U-Aerizm, they have oversized unisex. What's the difference between all these, and which one is best? I decided to try them all, and then compare them for you right here in this video. For reference, I am 5'6\", about 125 pounds after dinner. I have a 35-inch chest, 29-inch waist. I usually wear 28-inch inseam pants, and I usually wear extra small tops in most brands. The chinos I'm wearing in this video are Everlands Slim Fit, and they have a standard medium rise. Also, you're seeing these tees right out of the bag, no washing, drying, or shrinking. And if you're wondering if this is a two-tone explorer that I'm wearing, well, yes it is. This one is on loan from my friends at Bob's watches, so it's not mine to keep, unfortunately, but I am enjoying some wrist time with it this week. I've always loved the Explorer, and the two-tone is definitely something different. Let me know what you think about it down in the comments. All right, kicking things off with the Dry X Crunec short sleeve t-shirt, this one is from the Men's Collection, size extra small. It's about $25. It's made from a polyester nylon blend, so this is the only 100% synthetic t-shirt on this list. It's extremely comfortable, but it's definitely an athletic shirt. Like, I would not wear this with jeans or even chinos, but I would definitely wear it to go play pickleball or to go hiking or to work out. The fabric is perforated on the sides and the back, and it's really one of the most breathable t-shirts I've ever worn. It also fits really well. The length is perfect even for a shorter guy like myself. So I like this one a lot. We're off to a good start. Next up, the OG. We have the Supima Cotton Crunec short sleeve t-shirt. This one is also from the Men's Collection, size extra small, $25, and it's 100% cotton. This has been my go-to t-shirt for years, and I'm still very happy with it. It just fits and feels great. It's actually weird because I tried a couple of these on at a Uniqlo store in New York, I think like a year and a half ago, and they didn't fit me well. Like I feel like they changed their fit in like 2021, 2022, but this one works really well. So whatever they did, whatever you're doing Uniqlo, please keep doing it. Now I could probably wear this in a size small and then never have to worry about any shrinkage and the laundry, but this extra small fits me perfectly right out of the bag. It's gonna be hard for any other t-shirt on this list to dethrone this Supima Cotton Crunec, but let's keep going. So now we're looking at the U-Aerism Cotton Oversize Crunec half sleeve t-shirt. That's a mouthful. This one is a cotton poly blend, about half cotton, half polyester. This one is a size extra small, it's about $15. This is the first oversized t-shirt I've ever tried on from Uniqlo, possibly from any brand. And yes, it does make me feel like Tim DeSaint. It's actually very comfortable with all the extra room. Not sure how I feel about the half sleeves that go all the way down to the elbow. I don't think it's the most flattering look. Not that that always matters, but it kinda matters to me. The silhouette definitely doesn't go with the rest of my wardrobe. So I would have to really intentionally build an outfit around this shirt versus just using it with the stuff I normally wear. And now we're looking at that same t-shirt just in size extra, extra small. I just wanted to try a smaller size, given the oversized cut. Seeing both side by side, the extra small is definitely a better size for me, but it's cool that they carry a wide variety of sizes, at least in these unisex collections. Next up, we have the U-Croonac short sleeve t-shirt. This one is 100% cotton, size extra small, and it comes in at $20. So this is also from Uniqlo U, but it's not an oversized tee. So it does have a lot more taper through the torso, and it's noticeably more snug around the hips than those oversized Ariesm tees. But if you compare it to the standard Supima cotton tee, this Uniqlo U-Croonac has a more generous cut, especially in the shoulders and the sleeves. I think it's a slightly more modern cut or contemporary. I think younger people would probably prefer this over the Supima cotton tee, but millennials like myself probably would prefer the Supima tees. This is actually a very comfortable t-shirt. The sleeves are a bit too wide for my liking, but it's very wearable. And then here's that same shirt, just in extra, extra small, just for comparison. Again, this one is too small for me. Extra small is definitely my size. I could probably even size up to a small, assuming there will be some shrinkage because this is 100% cotton. Next up, we have the dry color croonac short sleeve t-shirt. So this one is 66% cotton, 34% polyester. I got it in a size extra small, and it comes in under $10. So this one is Uniqlo's cheapest t-shirt, even though it actually has more cotton in it than those Ariesm shirts. The fit is similar to the Supima cotton tee, although the body feels a touch longer. It might just be because the fabric is lighter and a little bit stretchier. But this material is noticeably thinner. It's almost like an undershirt. It's very soft, very comfortable, but it's also a little bit transparent. This might not be an issue with the other colors, but personally, I like my white tees to be opaque. I would use this as a comfy base layer under like a sweatshirt or a sweater. I don't think I'd wear it on its own, at least not in white. The fit is solid though. It really works for my build, especially after like a wash dry cycle. I think this would shrink up to the perfect length. And finally, we have the Ariesm Cotton Crewneck short sleeve t-shirt. So this is again a men's extra small. This one is 71% cotton, 25% polyester, 4% spandex. This is an Ariesm tee, but it's not part of Uniqlo U. So the cut and the details are a bit different compared to those U Ariesm oversized tees. This has 4% spandex, so it makes it stretchier than the other shirts in this video. Now, of course, cotton is stretchy on its own. Polyester can be stretchy, but spandex is very stretchy. And 4% spandex is actually quite a bit. This t-shirt is roomier all around than the Supima Cotton tee. And you can really feel and see this in the sleeves. The body is a touch long right out of the bag, but I've actually owned one of these for a few years in a different color. And I can say that after washing and drying it a few times, it shrinks up just a little bit and it fits really well. Now this Ariesm Crewneck isn't a refined t-shirt. It's not like a heavy weight, like crispy t-shirt that you're gonna wear with Jean Giorgino's. But it's great for athleisure style. Like I like wearing these with joggers or sweatshorts. It also makes a really good workout shirt. So it's kind of like a hybrid. Like you can wear it with regular clothes a little bit, but you can also use it with your gym clothes. And that's it. Those are your options right now from Uniqlo. Now, of course, Uniqlo has a bunch of different colors and designs and collaborations, but in terms of silhouettes and fits and fabric composition, these are your options. For me, the Supima Cotton Crewneck is still the OG. It's still the best, at least for my build and for my aesthetic. I mean, 100% Pima Cotton Tee for 25 bucks. It's a great deal. I think the U Ariesm Oversize Tee are great if you want something a lot trendier. They're very comfortable. The fabric feels great. Even though it's a poly blend, it still feels like a high-end t-shirt. If you prefer 100% cotton, I would check out the U Crewneck Tee. These are a slightly more modern cut than the Supima Cotton Tee, but they're not so fashion forward like those Ariesm Oversize Tee shirts. Really good middle of the road fit for pretty much anybody. If you're on a tight budget, those dry color Crewnecks are a great deal at $10. I probably wouldn't buy the white one unless you want to use it as an undershirt because it's a bit transparent, but the other color should be just fine. The Ariesm Cotton Crew, I think is good middle of the road shirt. You can use it to work out. It's got that 4% stretch, so it's very comfortable, a bit roomier than the Supima Cotton Tee, but it doesn't really look like a performance shirt. And then that Dry-X Crewneck, the first shirt I try on in this video, it's just a great athletic shirt. It's great for hiking, playing sports, going to the gym, but it's not good for wearing with jeans and genoes. Like it looks like a performance shirt. So there's really something for everybody here. I would love to hear from you out of all of these, which one is your go-to Tee shirt? Or if you prefer another brand, let me know down in the comment section and maybe I'll go check it out. I should probably just do like a full Uniclo try-on video because I've only done one of those and it was really popular, but that was a few years ago. So yeah, let me know if you want to see that. If you have any questions about these T-shirts or anything else, let me know down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " EDC means different things to different people. For some people, it's all about weapons. For other people, it's whatever this is. For me, EDC is literally the objects that I carry with me every day when I leave the house. Every day carry. Things like my phone and my wallet and my keys. Now, I'm really picky about these things. I'm always trying to optimize my EDC for my routines and lifestyle. And if you're watching this video, I bet you're the same way. So today, I'm gonna show you my current everyday carry. I'll tell you what I like about it, if you watch my last EDC video, a few things have changed, so stay tuned. Really quick, thank you to my friends at Nomos Glasshuta for sponsoring this video. I have owned, borrowed, and admired watches from this award-winning German brand for the last several years. And I'm excited to show you one of their most interesting and complicated pieces later in this video. First, let's talk about arguably the most important part of your everyday carry, the phone. So I am still using the iPhone 13 mini. To be honest, this phone seems a lot like the last two or three iPhones I've had. No major improvements. I know that the camera is better on the larger Pro models, but I really prefer the compact size of the mini. It's just easier to hold in the hand and it takes up less space in my pockets. The case is from Nomad. It's made of Horween leather out of the Chicago tannery in the USA. This leather does scratch kind of easily, but the scratches buff in nicely and it develops a cool patina over time. Now, I only use this case to prevent damages from drops. I actually really prefer the way that the iPhone looks without a case, but I've cracked a few screens and it's just better to be safe. This case has done an okay job at protecting my phone, but I do have one little crack in the screen from a very minor drop, so that's a little disappointing. I've considered switching to a more durable, more heavy duty case like an Otterbox, but I'm not sure if I wanna give up the compact profile of this case. So if you have used an Otterbox, please share the pros and cons down in the comment section. Okay, next up, let's talk watches. This week, I've been wearing the Nomos Metro Date Power Reserve. This is a 37 millimeter watch with a date window, a power reserve indicator, and a sub dial for seconds. It's classic Nomos. It's technically impressive, obsessively designed. It's minimal, but it's also playful. It's not boring. I love the little power reserve indicator. It's a practical complication because it tells you how much juice is left in this little mid-sized and mechanical watch. And you can watch the meter fill up as you wind it by hand, which is a charming little ritual, by the way, if you've never had a manually winding watch. Given the thin bezel and the light color dial, this watch wears a bit larger than the spec sheet would suggest. I think it'll look great on pretty much any wrist, including mine, which is about 6.3 inches around. If you want something even lower profile, Nomos recently released the Metro 33 in silver, muted red, and my personal favorite, Sage. This manually wound watch is just 7.5 millimeters tall, so that's the thickness of the case. So it wears very lightly, almost like a bracelet on the wrist, especially on this cool gray velvety strap. The pops of yellow, the domed sapphire crystal, the rounded lugs, it all comes together for a very unique eye-catching piece that's very low profile, but is still gonna turn some heads. When you see these watches in person, you can tell just how much time and energy and manpower went into designing and manufacturing them, from the engineers to the artists and the designers. I've never met a Nomos watch that I didn't like, and it's really been a pleasure having the brand as a sponsor on this channel. If you wanna learn more about Nomos, I will link to these two exact models down below in the description. Okay, moving on, I've been test driving a new wallet for the past couple of months. I love minimalist wallets, card holders, and this is probably the most minimalist one that I've tried so far. It might even be lower profile than my Anton Calder card holder, which has been my go-to wallet for the past few years. This one is from Grahams 28, a Hong Kong-based leather goods brand that's focused on luxury tier bags and phone cases and small accessories. This is their card holder in a dark blue Napa leather, and it has just three compartments, two for cards, and then this middle slot for cash. What I like to do is I keep three cards in this main slot, another two or three cards in this secondary slot, and then in the middle here, I just keep folded cash. This card holder has an interesting design. Sometimes leather wallets and card holders get stretched out over time, and then your card starts slipping out. This one uses a hidden elastic panel inside, so it stretches to accommodate more cards, but then it goes back to its original tightness, and your cards don't slip out. It's working very well right now. We'll see how it maintains its shape after a few more months. I would say my only gripe with this, and it's a small one, is that it can be hard to get a middle card out, but this is sort of the case with any card holder that has this design, where you're keeping multiple cards in the same slot, so I don't really mind. It's not that big of a deal. If you have any wallet brands or wallet suggestions that I should try out, please let me know down in the comment section. Okay, let's talk about keys. Keys are the most annoying part of my everyday carry setup, because I have too many of them. I own an old 1950s house that has multiple doors with different locks, so I have a lot of keys just for the house. I carry two keys for my office. I have this key tag for my kids' daycare, and then we have two cars, each with a bulky fob. Now, I've tried every type of key organizer out there. Before using this one, I was using a carabiner that I would just hook to my pants that had belt loops. I actually like that setup a lot. The problem is my pants don't always have belt loops, so if I'm wearing joggers or gym shorts or something, the carabiner doesn't really work. So I recently started testing the key bar, which has this little clamp that can hook onto a pocket or your waistband. And then to avoid carrying two fobs, I use this little S-beiner from Night Eyes, and it's very small, but it does lock, so your stuff is safe from falling out. And then I can kind of just take what I need. So it's a modular setup. If I don't need my car at all, I can just take my keys here. Usually what I do is if I'm switching cars, I'll just switch out the fob for the other car. And that way I never have to carry two fobs at the same time. I usually carry this hooked onto my pocket, and that kind of suspends the fob and this little tag inside my pocket, so it makes it a little more comfortable to carry. Given the unavoidable bulk of keys, at least for my lifestyle, this is a pretty good setup. It's not perfect, but it's decent. It'd be nice if we just didn't have to have this, if we could just use our phones instead of fobs and even instead of keys, but we're just not there yet. Okay, other than a watch, I wear a couple of just very small pieces of jewelry every day. One is my wedding ring, which is a platinum four millimeter slightly curved band. Very simple. And then the other one is this little, I think it's a two millimeter rope chain, silver bracelet from Mianse. Of course, the ring comes off for workouts. And actually at night, I take it off and I wear an aura ring just to make sure that my sleep was in fact garbage. Okay, next up, AirPods. I pretty much always have these on me now more so than ever. I'm just spending a lot of time these days doing things where my hands are occupied, but my mind is free. You know, washing dishes, working out, jiggling a baby. So I listen to a lot of podcasts and audio books these days. If you're curious, I've been enjoying the first law series by Joe Abercrombie and it's a great listen for anybody who enjoyed Game of Thrones. Anyway, these AirPods Pro are totally worth the upgrade over the regular AirPods. Just for the transparency mode, the haptic buttons, they're fantastic. I often wear just one at a time and I love that each AirPods has a microphone. So even if I just have my left one in, I can still take phone calls. Unlike my original AirPods, these pros seem to have a pretty strong battery life even after, I think like two years of use. I know that there are plenty of earbuds with better audio quality, but these work really well with the rest of my Apple products. And, you know, I'll take decent audio quality and really good functionality any day. Now I have these in a Nomad leather case, which matches the phone. And to be honest, I don't really know why I have this case on the AirPods, I guess it's just to match or something, but I like, you know, what Apple did with the AirPods case. I think it's pretty nice, feels durable enough and it's low profile. I don't really know why I have this case, to be honest. I guess just because they sent it to me and I wanted to use it. I guess it's kind of cool that it matches the phone, but yeah, it does fall off sometimes and I don't know, maybe I'll stop using it. Anyway, AirPods Pro, 10 out of 10. Next up, sunglasses. Now I live in Arizona, I wear sunglasses all the time. Every time I leave the house, I pretty much have sunglasses on even in the evening because it's so sunny here. I rotate through a few different pairs of sunglasses, but these little cheap ones from, I think the brand is called Sunglass Warehouse. They're defunct now. These were like 20 bucks and they've just been my go-to because they're the most comfortable to wear. I also keep a pair in my work bag. I keep a pair of sunglasses in each car because I never want to be without them. But I like these little ones because they just stay on my face. I don't know, they just have like the right amount of squeeze or something, so they just kind of sit there and I can like chase my toddler around the park and they just don't come off my head. I also have like some Ray Bands, which are nicer sunglasses, but they just don't stay on my face like these do. Now, I carry all of this stuff in my pockets and on my person when I leave the house. I do have a work bag, a laptop bag that I use when I come to the office, I put my laptop and my charging cables and other things in there, but I don't consider that part of my everyday carry because I don't use it every day and this is the stuff that I can take with me even without a bag. If you want a whole video about like my work gear and which bag I use, I will do that, but let me know down in the comments if that's something that you wanna see. Huge thank you again to NOMOS for sponsoring this video, for continuing to support the channel. I really love this brand, I love all their watches and it's been really fun to test drive this Metro Reserve Power Date for a couple of weeks now. I kinda wanna keep it. I will link to these watches and everything else that you see in the video down below in the description. If you have any questions about this or anything else, let me know in the comments. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " It's 8 a.m. on a Monday, and I'm sitting in a circle with 12 other people. We're having a sort of morning pow-wow gearing up for the day ahead. I'm feeling good, confident even, and I'm sitting directly on the carpet because, well, it's 1991 and I'm in kindergarten. My teacher, Mrs. Weaver, is going on about the alphabet or something, and I make eye contact with a girl sitting directly across the circle from me, Aaron Wotley. Now, I've only known Aaron for a few months, but I like her. She has a good vibe and I think we're friends. So we're looking at each other and her eyes drift downward just slightly. She looks up at me again and just points down to where I'm sitting. So I look down to see what she's pointing at and two things dawn on me simultaneously. The first thing is that there's a hole in the crotch of my sweatpants just left of the seam. The second thing is that I forgot to put on underwear. Now, I can only imagine what Aaron Wotley is seeing because from my angle, I can see skin, wrinkly skin. Now, this is the first time in my life that I remember being embarrassed, mortified. I wanted to leave that room and leave the school and find a new school that didn't have Aaron Wotley or anybody else that noticed my terrible mistake. Of course, I got over it. Aaron was cool. She didn't laugh, she was just giving me the heads up. We ended up being in the same class all the way through eighth grade and she never brought it up. In fact, I'd be shocked if she even remembered that this happened. But that experience saw me a very important lesson about myself, which is I care what people think. Now, these days, it's trendy for people to act like they don't care what anybody thinks, especially men. Many guys take this mindset a bit too far. They're actively trying to prove how little they care and it can come off as rude or even aggressive. But the truth is we all care what people think about us. It's a natural part of being one of the most social creatures on the planet. And it's not a bad thing. If no one cared about what anybody else thought, it would be chaos out there, anarchy. The human species probably wouldn't have survived to this point. I'm not saying you should be a people pleaser. I'm not saying you shouldn't stand up for yourself. I'm saying that it's okay and it's natural to want people to like you. And when people like you, it often makes your life a bit easier. Bosses hire people they like, partners date people they like, customers buy things from people they like. I think we sort of all know this is true, but still out in the wild, you see people doing things all the time that make them unlikable. So in this video, I wanna talk about six things you can do to make people like you from close friends to complete strangers. I'll start with something extremely simple. When you're having a conversation with somebody, don't talk about yourself. Talk about them instead. This is straight out of Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is a book worth reading by the way. And it's one of the easiest social hacks that you can learn. You see, we're all pretty narcissistic. We are all the main character in our own little movie, the center of our own little universe. We think about ourselves and we even talk to ourselves constantly. And we love when other people talk about us. Everybody does. So when you're in a conversation, especially with someone new, like on a first date, ask them questions about themself. If they ask about you, of course you should talk about yourself a bit too, answer their questions, but always try to steer the conversation back toward them. Counterintuitively, this will make the person think that you're more interesting, even if they don't learn a whole lot about you. And that's okay, let yourself be a mystery. Focus on them. The second tip is even simpler, but it takes a bit of nuance to get right. Smile. You don't wanna smile too much and you don't wanna fake it. A genuine smile involves your eyes, not just your mouth. That's why so many stock photos look a bit uncanny, a bit weird, is because the smiles are obviously fake. During an actual smile, you kind of narrow your eyes a little bit, causing these wrinkles at the corners. Funny thing is, if you force a smile, sometimes it does make you feel good and it turns into a real smile. I try to do this in pictures. I act like I just heard the funniest joke ever and I act like I'm laughing and it usually leads to a better picture. Another pro tip with smiling is to not do it too quickly or too often. You ever meet somebody who just smiles immediately and all the time and it's like, what are you selling, salesman? Be a little stingy with your smile. So don't smile right away. Wait till they talk to you or look at you and then smile and the person you're talking to will think that they caused that smile. They brought it out of you. And if you're happy to see them, they probably did. The third technique works equally well with loved ones and total strangers. Give a compliment. For example, mention something about their appearance. Glasses isn't the easy one. People use glasses to express their personalities. Every single person will appreciate when you compliment their glasses and it doesn't have to be overly enthusiastic like, I love your glasses. It can be subtle. Oh wow, nice glasses. Where'd you get those? Or it can just be really simple. I really like those glasses. You can also comment on shoes or earrings or hairstyles. Really anything that someone shows for themself. If someone's wearing a name tag, you can comment on their name. Tell them that you like their name. Oh, Sarah, I like that name. Everybody likes the sound of their own name, especially when it's coming out of someone else's mouth. Now one warning, try to avoid commenting on people's physique. Things that they can't change or can't easily change. Height, build, muscles, how thin they are. Don't comment on any of that. For loved ones who you know well, you can comment on their physique if it's positive. Okay, the next tip is to be vulnerable. How do you spell vulnerable? Vulnerable. I thought this little writing on postage would be interesting and add like a nice visual element to my videos, but I'm left-handed, my penmanship is horrible, and I don't think this is going well, but I'm gonna keep doing it. Vulnerability, you can show this in two different ways. The first way is to be self-deprecating. So the most skillful comedians don't make fun of other people, they make fun of themselves, and by doing so, they make other people laugh. Brian Regan is a great example of this. He somehow manages to be totally clean. He doesn't use any profanity. He doesn't tell dirty jokes, but he's hilarious. And he doesn't throw anybody else under the bus. He pretty much just makes fun of himself. He's self-deprecating, and self-deprecation is a form of vulnerability because you're admitting your own faults. And as many psychological studies have shown, vulnerability is attractive. The second way to show vulnerability is to ask for help or advice. You might think that asking for advice will make you look like you don't know what you're doing, like you're incompetent, but the exact opposite is actually true. A 2015 Harvard study found that asking for advice can make other people think you're more competent, not less. Plus, when you give other people the opportunity to help you, it endears you to them. People love feeling helpful or like they've made a difference in somebody else's life. That's why firefighters and speech pathologists and physicians assistants all report very high job satisfaction. They're constantly helping other people. I use this technique all the time. I'll reach out to people in my industry, like other YouTubers, and I'll ask them for advice. I'll ask them about growing my channel or creating better content or hiring people. Anything that they probably know more about than I do. Not only do most of them respond and agree to meet me or help me, a lot of them actually become really good friends. On the other side of that equation, I always love helping people. People reach out to me with those same questions or requests. I pretty much always say yes. It's flattering. It makes me feel like an expert and it makes me feel great to help somebody else out, especially who's trying to do something that I am doing or that I've done. I bet you also jump at the chance to help other people even if there's seemingly nothing in it for you. So give people that opportunity to help you. Okay, and the last thing you can do to make people like you is simply be around. That one went okay. As it turns out, us humans like stuff that we interact with regularly. This is called the mere exposure effect. Basically, as long as somebody doesn't have a reason not to like you, the more they see you, the more they're gonna like you. I feel like this was more obvious to older generations. Like my dad will go to the same restaurant over and over and over the same mechanic for years and he'll get to know them. He's on a first name basis with them. They know what he likes. He creates genuine bonds with these people even though they aren't really friends or family. And these bonds often come with perks. You know, he'll get the best table. He'll get the free dessert. He'll get a discount on a car repair. This kind of regularity seems to have been lost with younger generations, myself included. Many of my millennial friends crave novelty so they never go to the same restaurant. You know, they try something new every weekend. Or even if they do go to the same vendors over and over like the same mechanic, they don't really get to know them. You know, many young people don't even know their neighbors. But if you can become comfortable with actually talking and engaging with the people that you're around regularly anyway, and also visiting the same places over and over like the same restaurants and grocery stores and getting to know the people that work there, you will reap the compounding benefits of the mere exposure effect. You'll become a VIP regardless of what kind of credit card you have. And that's it. That is the last way to make people like you. And with these six techniques, even if you only pick up on one or two of them and start experimenting with them, I promise it's gonna make a difference in your life and in the lives of the people who you interact with. I wanna hear from you. Have you tried any of these things that I've talked about or do you have any other techniques that you use? Let me know down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Alright, so I'm walking out the door with a diaper bag on my back, a towel in one arm, my toddler in the other, and she's excited because we're going to the pool. And I'm excited because, well, we're going to the pool. You see, it's 109 degrees outside, which it's been every day for the past month, it feels like, and the only thing that we can do to stay sane is go to the pool. And that means I'm basically living in swim trunks. I've worn swim trunks more this summer than ever before in my life. Now on this particular day, I happen to be wearing a Vilbrekin flat front trunks, which cost a cool $280. And between the chlorine and the sunscreen stains and the diaper changes and the baking hot UV rays, I have put these trunks through the ringer. And it feels a little ridiculous because for most of my life, I never spent more than $15 on a pair of trunks. I just bought cheap ones from brands like H&M or ASOS or like this pair of Ocean Threads that I found in the kids section of Ross just to get some B-roll for this video. But as I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate quality over quantity. I'd rather buy one nice pair of swim trunks that's going to last for several years rather than a new cheap pair every summer. Still as I arrive at the splash pad with my diaper bag full of baby wipes and teddy grams and start slathering sunscreen on my little bundle of joy, I can't help but wonder, are $280 swim trunks just stupid? Should anyone actually buy these? Look what's really the difference between $20 and $200 swim trunks. And I thought to myself, self, you should make a video about that. So here we are. And I'm going to answer that question right after a huge thank you to today's sponsor, Nomos. Nomos Glasshuta is a German luxury watchmaker that since 1990 has been making some of the coolest, most innovative mechanical watches you can buy. I've worn many Nomos watches, including the famous Tangente, the Metro Date, the Tetra, and the Minimetic that has been my daily driver for months at a time. Today I'm excited to show off the Ahoy Neomatic 38 Date, which is a rare watch that you can wear to a job interview and then immediately go snorkeling. This 20 ATM automatic watch isn't your typical chunky diver. The case is just 38 and a half millimeters wide and it's less than 10 millimeters tall. So it'll slide right underneath the cuff of any button-up shirt. I don't know how Nomos fit their house-made caliber DUW6101 in such a small package, but color me impressed. Speaking of colors, this watch comes in two, Sky and Sand. Sky is a light desaturated blue and the sand is a warm tan color that looks incredible in all different types of lighting. In true Nomos style, both dials have a couple of small colorful accents and both watches have loomed hour markers and hands for visibility in the dark. And if you want something even smaller, the Ahoy Atlantic is just 36 millimeters wide. It still has 200 meters of water resistance. I actually love the 36 millimeter size for my wrist, but both of these watches are totally wearable on any wrist size. Regardless, you're getting a see-through case back or exhibition case back that lets you admire the in-house automatic movements powering these incredible time pieces. In my opinion, the Ahoy looks just right with a pair of Chino shorts and a button-up shirt and slip-on leather shoes. It also feels great with a pair of swim trunks and a more casual short sleeve button-up. And the best part is, I don't have to take the watch off to actually jump in the water. Anyway, I can make a whole video about these watches, but if you want more details and specs, go over to nomos-glashuta.com and you can get all the details there. I'll also leave links down below in the description to both of these exact models. Huge thank you again to Nomos for their continued support of this channel. Okay, so are fancy-pants swim trunks worth the premium price tag? I don't think designer swim trunks are worth it. It's just too much money for a pair of shorts. Yes, you're getting a better product. In my experience, these designer or luxury swim trunks are very comfortable. They look a little better. They're probably going to age well and last longer than cheap trunks. But you're also paying a markup for the brand and its status. If you think about it, a pair of lined nylon shorts can only be so expensive to manufacture. You can only spend so much money on a yard of nylon and some drawstrings and a zipper and some mesh lining. It doesn't take that much effort to sew together such a simple garment. A lot of the price has to do with brand and marketing. I'm not saying you should buy cheap swim trunks either. I actually can't stand wearing swimwear from fast fashion brands like H&M or ASOS, especially after experiencing the highest quality available from brands like Villebrekken and Orle Bar Brown. I also think it's important to remember that the price of clothing factors in some of the things that you can't see, like where it was made and under what conditions. And I think companies should price their clothes in a way that leaves enough margin to pay workers fairly. Like think about it, these cheap trunks that I got from Ross, they cost $7, originally 20, marked down to seven. How is that possible? Like, how could Ross and the company that made these trunks both make a profit? Someone has to get screwed in that process. And it's not Ross, it's not the customer. It's probably the people at the beginning of the process, like the farmers who are actually growing the raw materials and the garment factory workers who are sewing it all together. I really think we should try to avoid brands like that. But here's the good news. If you don't want to support fast fashion, but you also don't want to drop $200 plus dollars on a pair of fancy luxury swim trunks, there's a nice middle ground. I'm talking about brands like Chubbies and Bird Dogs and Fair Harbor and even Patagonia and Bonobos. I actually really like my Chubbies and Bird Dogs swim trunks. They're so much better than these cheap ones from Ocean Threads, which doesn't even sound like a real brand. It sounds like it was made up by ChatGPT. But these middle ground brands like Chubbies are also much more reasonably priced than Phil Brecken and Orla Bar Brown. For most guys, this middle ground is the sweet spot. You know, if you've been buying $20 trunks from Uniqlo or H&M, you know, spend a little more, $40 or $50 on a pair from Chubbies or Patagonia or Fair Harbor, and I think you'll be impressed. Now that said, if you do have the money and you want to experience the very best, then yes, premium quality luxury, fancy designer swim trunks are pretty nice. I really do feel good wearing my Orla Bar Brown Bulldog sports. And these flat front swim trunks from Phil Brecken do look a little better than the Chubbies, in my opinion. Both brands are crazy durable. Both have held up for many years, especially if you can find one of these brands on sale. You really can't go wrong. Now if you are trying to decide between these two brands, I like them both, but for different reasons. Orla Bar Brown has the superior waistband with these cool side adjusters. The sport fabric is nice and stretchy, but it is a bit shiny and swishy. Phil Brecken uses a less shiny, less swishy fabric, and the back pocket is deeper and more functional. I think the Bulldogs have a slightly more comfortable mesh lining, but both pairs are very comfortable. The fit on each of them is just right. They're slim, but not tight or restrictive. I think the Phil Brecken's are just slightly more tapered. If you splurge on either of these brands, I'm pretty sure you're going to be satisfied. But just a reminder, never go into credit card debt for clothing. If you can only afford cheap trunks right now, that's fine. My advice is to buy the highest quality you can afford at any given time. You can always upgrade later, but I think you'll be happier if you focus on fewer, better things. That's been my approach to swimwear for the last few years, and it served me well, especially now that I'm a part-time lifeguard at the kiddie pool. The bottom line, are designer swim trunks worth it? Probably not, but it is worth spending a little more to avoid fast fashion trunks. Anyway, thank you for watching my swimwear TED Talk. Thank you to Nomos again for supporting the channel. Definitely go check them out. Links down below in the description. If you have any questions for me about Nomos or swim trunks or luxury fashion or anything else, any video ideas, leave them down below in the comments section. Thank you as always for watching, and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " There comes a point in every YouTuber's career where they make a clickbaity video that makes it seem like they're quitting YouTube, but really they're just changing the name of their channel. Well, I'm excited to say that that time has come. Going forward, this channel will no longer be called the Modest Man, because I'm no longer the Modest Man. Now, I'm just Brock, and I'm gonna tell you why. To begin, we need to go back to the quaint year of 2007. I just turned 22. George W. Bush is president of the United States, and Barack Obama has just announced his candidacy. Apple launches the first ever iPhone, and the final Harry Potter book is released. Low rise jeans, Ugg boots, and Ed Hardy t-shirts are all the rage. And people are feeling pretty good. You know, the stock market is soaring, and nobody sees yet that the Great Recession is just around the corner. I'm about to graduate from the University of Maryland with a degree in psychology, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. You know, it's not the best job market heading into 2008, and I find myself getting rejected from interviews that I thought went pretty well. I finally end up at a small communications firm in Washington, D.C., but I'm my $38,000 salary. I can't actually afford to live in the city, so I move back in with my parents, and I battle rush hour traffic every morning to get downtown. I don't like my job, and I'm not good at it. But I like my coworkers, and it feels exciting to be in the city and to be making a little bit of money. I've been doing this job for three years, which is about two and a half years too long. I'm insecure at work. I don't present well, and I'm out of my element interacting with clients. I look very young. I'm short. I have a dumb haircut, and I don't know how to dress myself. Then in 2009, two small but pivotal things happen around the same time. First, after my boss tells me not to show up to a client meeting wearing my backpack ever again, I swallow my pride, and I ask a well-dressed, nicely groomed colleague, how he always manages to look so sharp. He casually mentions that he gets all of his clothes tailored, and a light bulb goes off. Second, I read a book called The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss, and I discover the concepts of passive income and location independence. A small seed is planted. Meanwhile, I experience heartbreak for the first time when my long-term college girlfriend finds somebody new. I don't yet understand that time and other women will heal this wound. And really, professionally, romantically, financially, I'm not doing great. I can't help but think that this 9-5 sit at a desk till your 70 life isn't for me. Now, outside of work, I'm getting more into music. You see, I grew up playing classical piano, and I was actually pretty good. In high school, I played drums in the jazz band, and I spent a lot of my free time making hip-hop beats on an old desktop computer. In fact, I made this beat we're listening to right now. I wasn't making these beats for money. I just wanted to create. I had to create, and music was the outlet. So now as I'm working this job that I don't like, I'm itching to get back into music. So in 2010, at 25 years old, I quit my job and I start running a home recording studio above my parents' garage. I was having fun. I loved not having to battle rush hour, not having to sit in pointless staff meetings, and I was spending a lot of time doing deep creative work, and it was very fulfilling. I even played in a couple bands, which was awesome. The problem was, I wasn't making any money, and my savings were drying up. So when a friend told me about this cushy job opening up at the IT company he worked for, I bailed on my music industry dreams, and I took a job once again that I didn't really want, mostly for the money. But this time, I was making $60,000 a year, and I felt rich. I got my own apartment. I bought a nice couch. I started dating again. And fueled by the likes of Tim Ferriss and Pat Flynn, I started learning a little bit about online marketing. I was tinkering with WordPress, learning about SEO and affiliate marketing, and I was enamored with this idea of making money online. At the same time, I was feeling some pressure to fit into this new ultra-corporate environment that I was working in, and so I started working on upgrading my personal style. I started getting my clothes tailored, like my whole colleague, and upgrading my shoes, and reading menswear blogs, like Effortless Gent and Primer Magazine, and visiting forums like Reddit's Mail Fashion Advice. I found a lot of great advice, but I did notice that none of the bloggers that I could find were really built like me. You know, I was a small guy, short and slim, and it was really hard to find clothes that fit. I thought, you know, that might be a good niche for my own blog. So I bought the horrible domain name shortmanstyle.com and very quickly rebranded it to The Modest Man. I thought that Man of Modest Type was kind of a gentler way of saying short guy. And on this blog, I started documenting my journey to upgrade my appearance. My early content was awkward and cringy, but I did start to get a little bit of traffic. I even started to make a little bit of money. Not much, mind you. In 2013, which was my first year of blogging, I made a whopping $1844. But it was enough, and I was itching to get out of this corporate job again, so I quit my job and I did a Tim Ferriss style sabbatical. I went to Ecuador for three months. By the way, if you've never done this sort of early retirement sabbatical, I highly recommend it. I was unemployed, or as I like to call it, self-employed. I was going to make about $8,000 that year for my blog, and so I needed cash. I did know a little bit about search engine optimization at this point, and these skills got me recruited for a digital marketing position at a large nonprofit in DC, a job that I took, and actually really enjoyed. I got my own office, my coworkers were awesome. I was making more money than I ever had. It was like $90,000 a year. I bought a condo, I got a new girlfriend. I was working on the blog evenings and weekends and lunch breaks. I cold emailed other content creators and bloggers and YouTubers just trying to make friends in the industry. One of these guys was Aaron Marino, aka Alpha M, and he actually convinced me to start this YouTube channel. So I started making videos with my phone in my living room poorly. But I was starting to believe that maybe this side hustle with a little bit more work could become a full-time gig. Maybe it could turn into a real business. Even though I liked this new job, I was still just desperate to get out of that 9-5 rat race. I could not live the cubicle life. Then I turned 30, which was a birthday that sort of messed with my head a little bit. I just felt behind in life, so I started working harder than ever. My business grew to $3,000 a month, and I was loving the hustle. In 2016, my girlfriend, who was very serious at that point, said that she wanted to move back to her home state of Arizona. I agreed to join her, and so for the third time in my adult life, I quit my job. I rented out my condo, packed up my things, and drove my car across the country to move in with the lady who I was pretty sure would become my wife. We landed in Tucson, Arizona, and just like that, our living expenses were cut in half. This meant that we could both focus full-time on our passions, mind being the modest man and hers being graphic design and illustration. Fun fact, she actually did all the branding and design for the modest man. And the next couple years were really nice. We got a nice house. We really settled in and made it our own. I started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which is the first sport that I really fell in love with, and my blogging slash YouTube business was growing pretty quickly now that I was doing it full-time. It actually surpassed $100,000 annual revenue for the first time. I proposed to my girlfriend. She said, yes, we got married. Life was good. And then for some reason, in 2019, we just threw a wrench in it. Despite our comfy life, we started itching for something else. Now I'd already begun going to New York City fairly regularly for a mix of work and play, and I'd always dreamed of actually living there. Meanwhile, my wife had become interested in this highly specialized illustration program in Rome, Italy. And we had this crazy thought. What if she went to Rome and I went to New York City and we sort of went back and forth for a year until she was done with school, and then maybe we settled down in New York? It was an exciting plan. You know, what could go wrong? We made this move near the end of 2019. And if you remember, at the beginning of 2020, COVID hit Italy really hard. A few months later, it reached the US, specifically New York City. So my wife had to drop everything and come back to the US. And then two of us holed up in a 300 square foot New York studio for a few months. And when that lease was up, we decided to ditch the city and migrate south to Richmond, Virginia, because I had some family there. This was not an easy period for us or for anybody else, but you know, we had good friends and we were making the best of it. The silver lining was business was incredible. Traffic to my blog had doubled from 2019 to 2021. During COVID, everybody was just on the internet all day. I also ended up buying another blog about watches called The Slenderist from a fellow YouTuber and that's like grew very quickly. So my websites plus this YouTube channel had become a pretty lucrative little lifestyle business. I was making three to four times more money than I ever did at a real job. In many ways, I had finally gotten exactly what I had been chasing all of these years. You know, I had kind of escaped the rat race. I had total control over my time. My wife and I could live and work anywhere. And I was on a path toward a financial independence. But despite all of this, I was becoming less and less happy with my work life. Things had changed. My work was no longer a creative pursuit. It was a business. I was spending most of my time hiring people and managing people and training, building out operating procedures and responding to emails and bookkeeping and doing taxes and just all those other things that you have to do when you run a company. The most creative part of my job was making YouTube videos. Basically, I was falling out of love with the business. It was profitable, but I wasn't enjoying the day to day. So I started to think about an exit plan, you know, maybe I could sell it. Then in October, 2021, everything changed when our daughter was born. Every dad knows when you become a parent, sleep and discretionary time pretty much plummet. Don't get me wrong, having a kid is amazing. All the cliches that you hear are true. They're incredibly cute and everybody else's baby is ugly except for yours, but it's tough and it changes every aspect of your life. Partly for this reason, my wife and I decided to move back to Tucson, Arizona to be closer to our little girl's grandmother who could give us a lot of help. We packed our things again, moved across the country again. And I'm not going to lie, I've moved a few times, but this one was tough. We were looking for months trying to buy a house. Our stuff was in storage the whole time. We were staying with family. I was working off of a car table in a guest bedroom at my mother-in-law's house. Thank you, Paula. It was a bit of a low point for me in terms of passion and I wasn't in a great mood and I wasn't my best self. I definitely was not looking forward to work. I knew that it was time to turn the page and frankly, I wanted to take some chips off the table. I knew that I could sell the business because I've received offers in the past, but I didn't want to sell this YouTube channel. It was just too personal and I wanted to keep making videos. So I listed my websites for sale, The Modest Man, The Slenderist and all of their social media. Basically everything except for this YouTube channel. It was a package deal and I got a bunch of offers. I ended up choosing one. I lawyered up, went through the due diligence ringer, signed a bunch of paperwork and then closed the deal a couple of months later. It was an emotional roller coaster, but it went pretty smoothly. When it closed, I felt an enormous sense of relief. Not only was it the biggest financial transaction of my life, but all of this weight of management and payroll and algorithms and all of that was just off of my shoulders instantly. I knew it was the right decision. In the weeks that followed, I did a lot of jiu-jitsu. I played some tears of the kingdom. I spent a lot of time working on our new house, hanging out with family, did a little bit of traveling. It was a nice break. Now, my plan is to focus on this YouTube channel as well as my personal Instagram and TikTok accounts, which are at Brock McGoff if you'd like to follow along. You can also check out my website, brockmcgoff.com for personal updates and sort of a list of what I'm up to. If you've watched till the end, I really appreciate you. I know that some of you have been here since the early days and I couldn't do this without you. I just want to say thanks. I'm looking forward to working on more videos for you guys. If you have any questions or suggestions or anything at all for me, leave a comment down below. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " There's one watch that I've been wearing every day for the past couple of months. And no, it's not this one. Actually, it's not this one either, although I do like this watch. It's this one, the Casio F84W. And I'm gonna tell you why right after. A thank you to today's sponsor, Factor. Factor is America's number one ready to eat meal kit. They make it easy to eat healthy and to look great for beach season by delivering fresh, never frozen meals right to your door. The best part is these meals arrive pre-prepared and ready to eat in just two minutes. Now Factor is actually owned by my favorite meal kit delivery service, Hello Fresh. They're both great. It just kind of depends what you're in the mood for. So if you don't want to do really any cooking or cleaning, Factor is a great choice. They offer calorie smart, keto, protein plus and vegan and veggie meals, all prepared by gourmet chefs and approved by dietitians. My favorite factor meal this week was the turkey chili and zucchini with ancho lime crema. This meal had 40 grams of protein and 18 grams of carbs, all in a tasty 670 calorie package. So it was the perfect post-workout meal for pool season. Like all factor meals, this one was faster than takeout, cheaper than delivery, and there were no dishes to clean up afterwards. Factor updates their menus weekly, so there's always something new to try, including plenty of add-ons. They even have breakfast items now, like these smoky bacon and cheddar egg bites. You can either choose specific meals or let Factor handle everything for you based on your preferences and that's what I do. If you want to try Factor for yourself, head over to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 to get 50% off your first factor box. One more time, go to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 to get 50% off your first box. Okay, let's talk about the Casio F84W. So this is basically a slightly different version of the iconic F91W, and this is the JDM model. That stands for Japanese domestic model. So it's like the F91W, but it was created to be marketed and sold in Japan. Maybe that's why it's a little smaller and lower profile than it's more popular, well-traveled cousin. You know, this one is under 34 millimeters wide, it's less than 9 millimeters thick, so it's a very small watch. But then again, the F91W is a very small watch too, so who knows. All I know is that I've been wearing this watch every day for a few months now, and I'm just loving it. I bought it a few years ago, wore it every day for a few weeks, and then it just sat in a box for a long time. I would take it out for certain things like if I went to the beach, and I just needed a beater watch that I didn't have to worry about, but it was never really a daily driver until recently. One day when I was unpacking after a move, I found this watch and I put it on, and I don't know, it just hasn't left my wrist since then. I'd been wearing this little NOMOS Neomatic, which is also a very small watch as my daily driver, and I like this watch, but you know, it's a little bit dressy, and I don't really dress up very much. I'm in shorts and a t-shirt most days, these days, and there's just something about this little casio that just kind of fit. It's so light and breezy on the wrist. Plus it lights up, got a little backlight there, and it makes these little beeping sounds, which my toddler loves. I can let her borrow it whenever she wants, and I don't have to worry about it. And that's because my friends, this is like a $20 watch. I think when I got it, it was like $17 from Amazon. If it gets destroyed, no big deal. But so far, it's held up to salty ocean waves and sand, dish soap, sweat, drops, bangs, baby teeth, and just general neglect. Functionally, it keeps perfect time better than any luxury watch that I've ever owned. It has the day and the date right there on the dial. No extra clicks or taps needed. And just a couple of clicks, you can get to the stopwatch for a simple timer. It's actually easier than using your phone. And you can activate the backlight for nighttime visibility. Now, it is a weak backlight. It's like a little light bulb up at the top left corner. It's not like a full loom or like indiglo or something like that. But it's enough to see at night, and it's actually much easier than turning your phone on. It's a lot dimmer, so you won't disturb your partner. It makes for an excellent bedside clock and alarm clock. On the wrist, it's super lightweight. It's about 20 grams. So it actually feels more like you're wearing a bracelet than a watch. The strap is really, really soft. I think it's actually much more comfortable than the more plasticy strap that you find on a lot of cheap digital watches, including the F91W. This thing just really disappears on your wrist. You forget that you're wearing it. And if you are wearing a long sleeve shirt, it'll slide right underneath the cuff, even if it's a very tapered sleeve. I would like to try this on different straps, maybe like a two-piece NATO, like a nylon strap or like a Perlon. But honestly, the stock rubber strap has held up just fine over the years. I kind of like that this is not the F91W. There's nothing wrong with that watch. It has a lot of vintage charm. I think it's popular for good reason. And it's adored by casual wearers and watch enthusiasts alike. But I'd argue that the F84W is even cooler because it's not as well known. You just don't see this model out in the wild almost ever. Now here's the thing. I know that I'm going to fall out of love with this watch one day, or actually probably just get bored with it and put it back in a box and then unearth it several years later. Maybe the battery will have died by then. That could be a couple of weeks from now, or it could be a few months from now. And that's fine. Maybe it'll be replaced from another old piece from the collection, like my old SKX or Seiko SNK. Maybe I'll start wearing the old Datejust again. But right now, I'm really enjoying this little Casio. And that's why I wanted to make this video right now, while the infatuation is still strong. So if you're in the market for a new watch, especially one that's affordable and reliable and looks great on smaller wrists, or if you just want to add some spice to your collection without spending a lot of money, go pick this one up from Amazon or eBay or wherever else you can find it. That's all I got for now. Thank you as always for watching. And until next time, stay stylish."

In this video, I'll tell you what color shoes work best with all the most popular suit colors, including black, navy, and gray. I'll also reveal the one shoe color that you should probably avoid, even though it's very popular and spoiler, it's not black. First, a quick thank you to today's sponsor, Factor. Factor is America's number one ready-to-eat meal kit. They make it easy to eat healthy and to reach your nutrition goals by delivering fresh, never-frozen meals right to your door.

One more time, go to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 for 50% off your first order. Okay, let's get into the video. First, we have to talk about the most overrated dress shoe color and it's tan. By tan, I mean really light brown. Sometimes it's called walnut or cognac and it doesn't work well with any dark suit like black, navy, dark gray charcoal. Tan does not work. Sure, it can work with other colors and I'll talk about that a little later in the video. But if you want to build a minimalist dress shoe collection with just one or two pairs, avoid light brown. With that out of the way, let's talk about what does work. The best dress shoe colors are black, dark brown, and burgundy. All three colors can be worn with a wide variety of suits and dress pants and unlike tan, they work for more formal occasions. Let's break it down by looking at the most popular suit colors, black, charcoal, navy, medium blue, and gray. Starting with black, the best shoe color to wear with a black suit is black. If you wear black suits often, you really need a pair of black oxfords in your collection. Sure, you can also get away with dark burgundy or ox blood with a black suit or black dress pants, but nothing beats black on black. Moving on to charcoal suits, you know, charcoal is really just very dark gray and it's pretty much the same as wearing a black suit, which means charcoal also looks really sharp with black dress shoes. Now, unlike black, charcoal is a bit more forgiving when you pair it with like a dark brown or burgundy or ox blood. Black is still your safest option, but if you're wearing a charcoal suit, you can definitely mix it up with like a very dark red ox blood shoe. Again, don't wear light brown or tan shoes with charcoal suits. It doesn't work. Moving on to navy, this is probably the most common suit color. Chances are you have a navy suit hanging in your closet right now. And when I say navy, I mean true navy, which is a very dark color. In terms of shade, it's about the same as charcoal. It's just a different hue. But when it comes to shoe color, navy is a bit more versatile than black or charcoal. With the navy suit, you can wear black, dark brown, even medium brown or burgundy or ox blood shoes. Black is going to be more formal and a navy suit with black shoes is a very sharp look. Dark brown is always a safe bet. Navy and dark brown is always going to work. And if you want to set yourself apart a little bit, try wearing your navy suits with a pair of dark burgundy or ox blood shoes. That look is just pure class. Again, light brown or tan doesn't really work here. Navy is just too dark to wear with light shoes. So you're going to see this all the time out in the wild from weddings to Wall Street, but I'm telling you it's not the best look. Moving on to medium blue. So medium blue is just anything that's lighter than navy. It's a big category. Again, it's an incredibly popular suit color. And unlike navy, medium blue can be worn with lighter brown shoes, but it also works with dark brown and burgundy. Again, I would avoid tan shoes with medium blue. Now, if you're wearing an actually light blue suit, you can definitely wear tan shoes. In fact, that's a really nice combo, especially for like a summer wedding. And you can wear black shoes with mid blue suits, but it's a bit of a bold look, a bit fashion forward, not the easiest to pull off. And finally, let's talk about another very popular suit color, gray. And when I say gray, I mean just anything lighter than charcoal. So there's medium grays, there's lighter grays, and we'll talk about each of them. Now, gray suits and gray dress pants are extremely easy to pair with shoes because they go with everything. Medium gray is especially versatile. A mid gray suit looks good with black shoes for a more formal, serious look. It also works well with dark brown and medium brown. It looks good with burgundy and oxblood. A lighter gray suit pairs well with lighter brown and even tan shoes. And it also looks good with burgundy and oxblood. If you ever wanted to try wearing white sneakers with a suit, light gray is a good option. So with gray suits, you can kind of choose your own adventure. If you want to look more formal, wear black shoes. It's a great look for like a formal evening event or some job interviews. If you want to dress it down a bit, go with a lighter brown shoe. And of course, there are other suit colors. You know, there's burgundy, which pairs well with black shoes or oxblood or dark brown. There are dark green suits, which look good with darker browns and black. There are brown suits, which look good with any shade of dark brown shoes or burgundy or oxblood. Tansuits, they look good with any shade of brown shoe, really, especially darker browns and also creams and whites. But let's be honest, chances are if you're suiting up, you're wearing black, charcoal, gray, or navy. And if you follow the guidelines that I laid out in this video, you'll be able to match your dress shoes and your suit and your dress pants like a professional stylist every single time. I want to thank Factor again for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. I will link to them down below in the description. If you have any questions for me about matching your shoes to your suits or anything else, leave them down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

This 170 year old denim manufacturer is More popular now than they've ever been and that's why they offer so many different styles and cuts of jeans And it's nice to have options, you know slim skinny athletic taper But it can be tough to figure out which cut is right for you, especially if you haven't tried them all on for yourself So in this video, I'll try on eight different pairs of Levi's jeans from 510s to 505s and everything in between I'll show you how they fit on me give you my recommendations for which pairs are my favorites and then which I think will work for various body types For reference, I'm about five six with shoes on and 120 pounds after dinner before we get into the video quick Thank you to today's sponsor factor factor is America's number one ready to eat meal kit They make it easy to eat healthy and to reach your nutrition goals this spring by delivering fresh Never frozen meals right to your door.

Okay, let's get into the video So here are the genes that I ordered 510 skinny fit 511 slim 512 slim taper 513 slim straight 531 athletic slim 541 athletic taper 501 original and the 505 regular to keep things consistent I went with a lighter wash in every style now my actual waist is about 29 inches around I usually wear a 28 or a 29 depending on the brand and the cut but for science I ordered the same size in every style 2930 So let's see how each pair fits starting with the Slimmest fit and then working our way up and I will tell you how Levi's describes each fit and then I'll tell you my thoughts So starting with the 510 skinny fit Levi says these sit at your waist and they're skinny throughout I actually think these have a nice silhouette, but they're tight I mean they're uncomfortably tight in the hips and the seat you can see that pulling across the front of my hips I do like the shape of the leg though, especially below the knee I'd probably get these hemmed for slight or no break because they are very tapered and I don't really like how the stacking looks I might also size up to a 30 waist just for comfort and you know if I had to get the waist taken in a little bit That wouldn't be a big deal. I'll be honest a few years ago. These would have been my top pick I've owned Levi's 510s in the past, but nowadays I do want a little bit of extra room So I'd probably skip these next up. We have the 511 slim fit So Levi's says that these sit below your waist and they're slim throughout I think they're a pretty substantial jump up from the 510s in terms of room through the hips and the leg The waist doesn't feel much different though. They definitely have more of a straight fit Due to less taper below the knee, but I really don't hate the look actually I think if you hemmed these a couple inches, they look pretty good They're definitely more comfortable than the 510s and I would say these are a top contender If I had to pick one pair of Levi's just considering everything style and comfort and fit and aesthetic I think these were probably my go-to. They also look nice cuffed very clean drape and a nice leg shape Next up we have the 512 slim taper according to Levi's these sit below your waist and they're slim through the thigh So basically these are like the 511s, but they have a more aggressive taper from the knee down to the ankle So a different bottom block. They are noticeably more narrow in the leg opening than the 511 It makes the 511 almost seem like a straight leg. They might even have too much taper below the knee depending on what you like I would say that with this much taper you'd have to get them hemmed. I wouldn't want any sort of stacking or break These are extremely comfortable. I think they're a really good middle ground between the 511 and like the 531s Which we'll look at in a minute. Honestly, I might choose these over the 511s. They're sort of interchangeable They both look really good and they're comfortable. Okay. Next up we have the 513 slim straight These sit below your waist. They're slim through the seat and thigh and they have a straight leg I immediately noticed that these had a Substantially longer inseam than the other pairs I tried on it might just be an anomaly, you know, these jeans are mass manufactured And so sometimes you will find these discrepancies from one pair to the next Either way the calf and the ankle have a lot of room. They're a bit too wide for my taste It almost feels like a boot cut silhouette. The rise feels similar to the 511s or the 512s The waist feels a little looser. I could probably size down to a 28 in this style But yeah, I'm not really a fan of this silhouette. It does seem a little bit flared through the leg I don't really know who this style would be for. It's not very flattering and I can't really imagine a body type that would Choose this style over one of the others. Next up we have the 531 athletic slim So Levi's describes these as sitting below your waist and being slim from the hip to the ankle These are definitely much roomier through the hips and the thigh hence the athletic description They're actually pretty similar to the 513s, but they definitely have More room in the hips and the crotch area. They're actually really comfy I find them more comfortable than the 513s one kind of weird thing the front pockets are oddly deep I think maybe if they're made for bigger guys who take up more room in that top block It might make sense to have bigger deeper pockets. The rise feels a little low compared to the 512 and 513 It's more like the 510 rise and similar to the 513 the waist is a little bit looser Like I could probably size down to a 28 if I were going for a looser look I would definitely consider these but I'd wear them cuffed Which as you can see here helps with the clean drape and I actually think it looks pretty good if you are experimenting with like a more straight roomy silhouette next up we have the 541 athletic taper So these sit at your waist and they have extra room in the seat and the thigh now They're pretty similar to the last pair of the 531 athletic slims I actually think the overall leg shape is slightly better because of that taper from the knee down to the ankle Again, the waist is a bit too loose. I'd either have to wear a belt or just size down to a 28 The rise feels a bit longer than the athletic slims I feel like vanity sizing is coming into play here with these looser cuts Like I'd have to start sizing down as I went up to these looser cuts Actually like the overall shape of the leg I would keep the same shape and just need it to be a little slimmer all around So maybe sizing down would achieve that but these 541s would be a great choice for bigger guys who want something comfortable That can accommodate like bigger hips and thighs, but this still has a nice taper through the leg Okay, next up we have the 501 original these sit at the waist and they have a Regular fit through the thigh and a straight leg. Who knows what regular means these days But these are definitely much roomier in the hips than all of the other cuts. I've tried on so far There's lots of room all around and all through the leg. The rise is pretty similar to the 541s Now, obviously I wouldn't wear these with a slim fit top like this white t-shirt I'd wear them with something roomier and baggier and draper You know, it feels a bit off balanced with a slim top and baggy pants But honestly, I don't think I'd wear these anyway. They're just too baggy for me It's so much material and so much weight. It actually feels uncomfortable I know a lot of people say that, you know, wearing looser clothes is more comfortable and I agree to an extent But to me, this is actually too much to be practical. It's a lot of denim. It's a bit cumbersome I did try these cuffed and I actually think the leg looks a lot better It does drape pretty nicely. I can see how people like the style But it's still a bit too loose for my thin legs. And finally we have the 505 regular Levi's says that these sit at your waist and they have extra room in the thigh and a straight leg So I actually don't really see a huge difference between these and the 501 originals Despite the 501s being ultra trendy and the 505 is being like old man jeans The rise feels slightly higher than the 501s Not by much, but I think it's the longest rise of all the Levi's jeans I've ever tried on These are basically the type of jeans that I wore in like high school and college, which is kind of funny But like if you look at them side by side with the 501s and 505s both cuffed They look pretty much the same. In fact, I would say I prefer the 505 silhouette slightly It actually seems a little bit more tapered through the leg Despite Levi's description of the 505s being roomier than the 501s, but honestly, they're not that much different Okay, so that was eight pairs of jeans. It was a lot to take in so let's summarize My two favorites were the 511 slim and the 512 a slim taper for the 511s I'd wear them with a slight break or cuffed and for the 512s I'd wear them with no break or cuffed if I wanted to experiment with looser fits I tried the 531 athletic slims and wear them cuffed for that nice clean drape for really skinny guys like thinner than me I think the 510s are a good choice and for heftier stockier guys I'd recommend the 541s these have plenty of room in the hips and the thighs But they still offer that nice gentle taper through the leg Of course, if you want to be on trend like right now in 2023 go for the 501 originals or just get some 505s They're basically the same thing You can probably find them for cheaper and more widely available and a wide range of sizes as far as I can tell there's not much difference Just a couple more closing thoughts first while it's a pain to Order all these clothes and try them all on it's actually a great way to like really get to know a brand and potentially discover your new favorite pair of jeans For example, I never would have known that the 512 slim tapers might be a better fit for me than the 511s Or definitely the 510s Of course, I'm hoping that this video saves you some time from having to try all of these different cuts Maybe it helps you narrow it down to two or three styles that you want to try on If you have any questions about Levi's jeans or anything else leave them down in the comment section below Thank you again de facto for supporting the channel. I'll link to them down in the description Thank you as always for watching and until next time. Stay stylish You"

        "transcript": " So, you got a job interview. Congrats! You're probably feeling kind of excited. A little bit nervous. What if they ask tough questions? You know, what if you're not qualified for the job? What about the awkward salary negotiation? You have enough to worry about, and on top of that, you have to figure out what to wear to the interview. Even if it's over Zoom, you still got to dress up. Maybe you've done some research on the company, you figured out that they have a smart casual dress code, or maybe their recruiter told you to wear a business casual. But what do those things even mean these days? Should you just wear a suit and tie? I get it. Job interview attire can be confusing, but in this video, I'm going to clear it all up. Specifically, we'll go over three things. First, I'm going to tell you the most important thing to keep in mind when getting dressed for a job interview or any professional setting. Then I'm going to give you three outfit examples that you can just copy. And finally, we'll go into each office dress code like smart casual and business casual and decide for them, figure out what they really mean in 2023. Before we get into it, huge thank you to today's sponsor, Nomos Glasshuta. I have been wearing a Nomos watch, the Mini Matique, every day for a few months now, and it's quickly become my favorite watch. Even before owning it, I've always been a fan of the Nomos Aesthetic. It's this clean kind of Bauhaus design. They have innovative in-house mechanical movements and automatics, a lot of versatile case sizes that work well on smaller wrists. Now for this partnership, Nomos sent me one of their new Tangente Neomatic Blue Gold watches in 35 millimeters. It also comes in 39 millimeters, but the smaller size is perfect for me. The Tangente, and by the way, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. I've heard a few different pronunciations. It's one of Nomos's most popular collections. It's definitely a dressy watch, but it doesn't feel too fragile or dainty. Like, you don't just wear this watch for special occasions. You can dress it down. I would definitely wear this blue gold version with jeans or chinos. This round, stainless steel watch is powered by an in-house automatic movement that's just 3.2 millimeters tall, which allows for a very thin case that slides easily under the cuff of any dress shirt. And you could admire this feat of engineering through the sapphire crystal case back, although that would require you to take the watch off your wrist, which I'm telling you, you're not going to want to do. But the most striking part of this watch is the dial. It's this deep, warm, sunburst blue that kind of changes depending on what sort of lighting you're in. The rhodium-plated hands and highly legible silver numerals look perfect against the blue dial. There's also a sub-dial for seconds, and the word neomatic or neomatique appears in gold under the Nomos wordmark. And it's very Nomos to add a little splash of color on their dial, just to give it a little bit of extra playfulness. Now, this watch comes on a shell, cordovan strap from the legendary Horween tannery in Chicago. You can also get it on a silver bracelet for a more casual, sporty look. But let me tell you, the cordovan is very comfortable and it breaks in really nicely. I think this is a great everyday watch. It's perfect if you work in like a smart casual or a business casual office, but it's easy to dress down. And yeah, you can wear it with the suit, you can wear it with the tuxedo. So it kind of does it all. Anyway, I could go on all day about Nomos and the Tangente in blue gold. But if you want more images and more details about this watch, head over to Nomos' website. I'll link to it down below in the description or you can just Google it. Huge thank you to Nomos for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. Big fan of the brand and it's really a pleasure to work with them like this. Okay, let's talk about job interview style. And the number one thing to remember is that it's always better to be a little overdressed than a little underdressed. If you're overdressed, you might feel a little silly, but if you're underdressed, you look silly. Better to feel foolish than to be the fool. So keeping that in mind, here are a few outfits that will always work for pretty much any interview. Number one, a gray suit, white dress shirt, navy tie and black oxfords, and of course, a nice watch. This is a great outfit for especially younger guys who want to look a little bit more mature. You could also take this outfit, but make it a navy suit, which is good for older guys who want to look a little younger because blue does that. Swap the black dress shoes for dark brown or burgundy, swap the navy tie for burgundy and keep the watch. The outfit number three is a bit more casual, a pink dress shirt, casual sport coat, khaki trousers, brown suede derbies or lace up shoes, a leather briefcase and a tasteful watch. This is a great option when you don't want to suit up. And then finally, you could swap the jacket for a sweater, swap that dress shirt for like an Oxford button up tucked in, keep everything else the same. And you've got yourself a casual outfit that's going to work for any casual or spark casual job interview. And this is as casual as I would go. But of course, your interview attire depends on the dress code. So let's break down these professional dress codes and figure out what they actually mean. The most common office dress code right now is smart casual. Now there's no official definition of smart casual. So it's always okay to ask your recruiter what it means. That said, you can think of smart casual as mixing dressy and casual elements in the same outfit. Here's a side by side comparison of casual on the left and smart casual on the right. It's hard to explain, but you can see the difference, right? As another example, a typical casual outfit is jeans, t-shirt and sneakers. To make it smart casual, you want to swap out one or two items for dressier options. For example, you could keep the jeans but instead of a t-shirt wear a long sleeve polo. And instead of the sneakers wear boots. Or you could swap the t-shirt for a button up shirt, keep the jeans, but tuck your shirt in and swap the sneakers for loafers. If you want to keep the casual shirt and casual shoes, try adding a sport coat on top to make it smart casual. Especially a casual sport coat kind of unstructured like this one. And this works the other way around too. Instead of dressing up a casual outfit, you can dress down a formal outfit. For example, take a suit, but ditch the tie and swap the dress shoes for sneakers. Disclaimer, that's not the easiest look to pull off. So tread carefully. Or ditch the jacket altogether and swap the dress shirt for a refined sweater like a merino turtleneck. Of course, keep in mind the temperature. You're likely to feel a little too hot during a job interview. So if you run hot, maybe don't wear a turtleneck or a wool sweater. So that's smart casual. But what about business casual? This dress code is still super common in the workplace, but it doesn't mean what it used to. So let's break it down. Business casual used to mean that you had to wear a jacket over a dress shirt, but no tie. Nowadays, it's much more relaxed. Most business casual offices expect you to wear a button up shirt tucked in, but no jacket or tie. Jeans and sneakers are not business casual, except for maybe on casual Fridays. Of course, if you're interviewing for a job on Friday, don't follow casual Fridays. Okay, just dress like it's a Monday. Now, if you have a job interview and you're kind of on the fence about whether or not to wear a jacket, I say go for it. Again, totally fine to be just a little bit overdressed, but you don't want to be underdressed during a job interview. So when in doubt, wear the jacket. For business casual shoes, go with loafers or dressy lace ups like blue shirts, derbies, maybe dress boots or dress Chelsea's dressy Chukka boots. You know, I'm not talking about like Clark's desert boots here. Really, if you're going to wear boots, make sure that they're not too casual. Doc Martens are not going to cut it during wintertime. You can try layering a sweater over your button up shirt. This is a great substitution for a jacket and it's very comfortable. It'll keep you warm and it's a sharp look. Also, if your shirt is wrinkled or if it doesn't fit properly, a sweater will hide all of its flaws. As for outerwear, you're going to want to skip the parka and opt for something a little bit dressier like a wool overcoat or top coat. You know, if it's springtime, just wear like a mac jacket or a trench or a raincoat. So that's business casual. And finally, we have business formal business formal is actually the easiest dress code for guys because it just means that you got to wear a suit and a tie and dress shoes. Now, I might be tempting to wear a fun color or really kind of spritz a turra it up with like a burgundy suit and you know, pocket squares and a lapel button and fancy tassel loafers. But I recommend keeping it simple. Save your fancy pants outfits for weddings and brunch dates with the boys. For the workplace, you're going to want to stick with navy and gray or charcoal. If you really want to stand out, you can try a brown suit, you know, any shade of brown, it's still conservative enough for most formal environments, but it's something a little bit different. So it'll set you apart from the sea of navy and gray. Also, don't bring your backpack to the office or to a job interview. If you're going to wear a suit, you're going to look like a student who just graduated and has his first job interview, especially if you already look young. So get yourself a proper work bag, like a briefcase or a portfolio or a messenger bag. And again, if you're interviewing on a Friday, don't assume it's okay to go with casual Friday attire, you know, wear a suit and a tie. But of course, most guys don't work in formal offices, even law firms and, you know, Wall Street banks have kind of loosened up their dress codes the last decade or so. So chances are nine times out of 10. If you have a job interview, it's going to be smart casual or business casual. And if you follow the advice that I laid out in this video, you can be sure that your clothes will be working for you and not against you. I'm not saying that you'll definitely get the job, but I'm not saying you won't. I have a good feeling about this one. Either way, be sure to top your outfit off with a nice accessory. I think the best accessory for guys is just a solid wrist watch. An elevated everyday watch like this, No Most Tangente is perfect for pretty much any professional setting. Check all the right boxes for me. And I think it will for you too. Of course, I'll link to this watch below in the description. If you have any questions about a job interview style or workplace attire in general, please let me know down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching. And until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " I've tried a bunch of different hairstyles over the years. I've done longer and medium length kind of wavy hair. I've had very short haircuts that had a lot of texture. And of course I've been influenced by hairstyle trends. For a few years I rocked the undercut side part which a bunch of guys had. I actually still think that's a pretty good haircut. But there's one haircut that I keep coming back to. It's practical but it's not boring. It's good for guys who are willing to put a little bit of time into styling their hair just a few minutes. But it's still a pretty low maintenance haircut. It's especially great for guys with straight or wavy hair and especially guys with thick hair like me. So in this video I'm gonna explain what exactly this hairstyle is, what to tell your barber if you wanna get this haircut. And then of course how to style it. Before we get into it, huge thank you to Factor for sponsoring this video. Factor is America's number one ready to eat meal kit. They make it easy to eat healthy and reach your nutrition goals by delivering fresh, never frozen meals right to your door. And the best part is there's no prep needed. Factor meals arrive pre-prepared and ready to eat in just two minutes. Factor is actually owned by my favorite meal kit delivery service, HelloFresh. They're both great, it just kinda depends what you're in the mood for. If you don't wanna do any cooking or cleaning, Factor is a great choice. They offer calorie smart, keto, protein plus and vegan and veggie meals all prepared by gourmet chefs and approved by dietitians. My favorite Factor meal this week was this Italian ground beef and marinara bowl with ricotta and pesto zucchini. This keto meal had 38 grams of protein and only 16 grams of carbs with no added sugar. So it made a perfect post-workout meal. I also liked the jalapeno lime cheddar chicken with spicy cilantro cauliflower rice. This one packed a little bit of a spicy punch and it definitely helped me hit those protein macro goals for the day. And these were totally hassle free meals. There were no dishes to clean up afterwards. It's actually faster and easier than takeout or delivery. Factor updates their menus weekly so there's always something new to try including a bunch of add-ons and snacks and smoothies. You can either choose specific meals or let Factor choose for you based on your dietary preferences, which is what I do. But my favorite thing about Factor is just how easy it is to get a meal on the table that tastes good and that's healthy. So if you wanna try Factor for yourself head to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 for 50% off your first factor box. One more time go over to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 to get 50% off your first box. Okay, let's get into the video. So I call this hairstyle the tapered brushed back side part. Tapered just means that your hair is longer on the top than it is on the sides in the back. But it's not an undercut. Taper is gradual. So an undercut is when there's a disconnect meaning there's a clear line where hair goes from long to short. Taper is just a gradual change from long to short from the top of your head down to your ears and neckline. It's also not a fade. A fade is an extreme version of a taper where it gets very, very short. Sometimes you can even see your scalp which is called a skin fade. So this is just a gentle taper. Brushed back means that I'm brushing all of the hair toward the back of my head. So this isn't like a normal side part where your hair follows the swirl of the crown of your head and this brushed back side part we're just going straight back. This is a crucial detail because it works better if you have a little bit of extra length, especially on the top and the back of your head. So if you wanna try this hairstyle, you might wanna grow your hair for a couple of weeks before going to the barber. And of course, side part means that it's an asymmetrical style. You do have a part line, but in this style, the part line is actually a little bit higher up on your head, not right on the corner and it doesn't go all the way back. It only goes maybe halfway back and then everything just gets brushed back. So while you may be thinking this is just a normal side part haircut, it's actually a little bit different and I think a little bit cooler, a little more versatile and it works well as your hair grows out. So that means you don't have to get your haircut as often. Okay, let's look at how to style it starting with clean, wet hair. You're gonna need some medium hold product or lightweight product, a towel and a blow dryer. You can use a brush, but I find that using your hands works just as well, maybe even a little better. Start by towel drying your hair and be gentle. You don't have to get it all the way dry. You're just trying to remove the bulk of the moisture out of your hair. You don't want it dripping wet. Then get some light and medium hold product, something with a matte finish, not like a shiny pomade. I like this Hans de Foucault sponge wax. I've been using it for a few years and spread it all across your palms and then spread it evenly in your hair going from the back to the front. So the key is you want to coat the entire strand of hair, even the back of it. If you just go from front to back, it won't actually help glue your hair down. So work it in from the back to the front, including in the sides and on the back and on the top. And then once you have it coated, push all your hair back and spend a minute here, really get it going back. Just use your fingers as a comb. Again, if you want to use a brush you can, but I find using your hands leads to a more natural result. Now you have two options here. If you want to let your hair dry, but still look kind of damp, you can use a high hold product like gel to lock your hair in place and then just let it dry. After it dries, it's still gonna look slightly wet, but it's gonna be locked in place. And it's kind of that nice, like I just got out of the shower look. You see a lot of celebrities wearing their hair like this on the red carpet. If you really want it to stay like that all day, you should probably lock it in with a little bit of hairspray. The second option, which is what I usually do is to use a blow dryer to sort of sculpt your hair and to give it a bit of extra volume. If you're not in a rush, put your blow dryer on low and start drying your hair. Make sure to aim everything toward the back. I like to start with the size and really kind of glue them down so they're not puffing out. You can kind of pick up sections of hair with your hands and aim that air toward the roots. This is gonna help remove all the moisture and get your hair going in the direction that you want it to. If you are struggling to achieve the volume that you want or the lift, you can definitely use a brush at this point to kind of curl your hair backwards as you dry it. This will create a lot of extra height and volume. Now I have plenty of problems, but lack of volume isn't one of them. So I usually skip the brush. What's crucial here is to make sure that the hair at the top and the back of your head is actually going backwards. You don't want to follow the swirl of your crown like you would with a regular classic side part. And at this point, depending on how everything looks, I mean, you can put your blow dryer on low and you can really sculpt your hair, especially if you used a nice product when it was still kind of damp, like a lightweight product. I mean, the blow dryer can really do some amazing things if you have the time for it. And then once everything is to your liking, you are gonna want to lock your hair in because especially if you use a blow dryer, it's gonna be a little bit soft and it will kind of fall down throughout the day. So you need a little bit more product to lock it in place. Of course, if you like that natural look, you don't have to use any more product. And throughout the day, you might get some strands kind of falling down in your face and it's kind of a cool look. It's kind of that like 90s boy band look. I sort of dig it. But for me, especially if it's like a windy day outside, I like to lock my hair in place so it's not falling down throughout the day. I'm gonna use the same product, this Sponge Wax, but this time I'm gonna spread it over my fingers and work it from front to back. If your hair tends to be a bit unruly, you should use a higher whole product, something like a matte finish pomade. And that's it. And I know this might seem like a lot of work, especially if you're not used to spending time styling your hair or if you don't own a blow dryer. But I promise once you do this a couple times, it's less than five minutes. It's like a two or three minute process. In fact, using a blow dryer is faster than letting your hair air dry. And this is just great hairstyle. I mean, I get confidence on it. It's easy to style, it's predictable. You don't need to get your haircut every two weeks. And the thing that I really like about this haircut is it looks good now, it looked good 20, 30, 40 years ago. And I think it's still gonna look good 20, 30, 40 years from now. So if you want a hairstyle that you don't really have to think too much about, but that looks a little better than just like a crew cut or something like that. And that isn't trendy like the TikTok broccoli head cut. This is a good choice. Thanks for more times, you factor for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " I'm not saying that you should try to look wealthy or expensive, I'm just saying that you can when you want to. And that's the cool thing about style. You can use it to send certain signals to other people. And sometimes it makes sense to put forth a certain image or to project a certain status. For example, if you're in sales, it would behoove you to look successful. If someone is supposed to trust you to guide them through a big purchase like buying a car or a house, they want to know that you're good at what you do. How do you tell if someone is good at their job? Well, you see how much money they make. In his book, Status and Culture, author W. David Marks says, money can also function as a vibrant symbol for other virtues such as intelligence and hard work. Now, I understand that money is a flawed indicator, but in general, we do associate wealth with competence. Here's the cool thing. Even if you don't have a lot of money to spend on clothes, you can still look expensive. So if you're trying to fake it till you make it, this video is for you. First, a quick thank you to today's sponsor, Factor. Factor makes it easy to eat healthy and reach your nutrition goals. They do this by delivering fresh, never-frozen, tasty meals right to your door. The best part is there's no prep needed. Factor meals arrive pre-prepared and ready to eat in two minutes.

If you don't want to do any cooking, Factor is a great choice. They offer keto, calorie smart, vegan and veggie, and protein plus meals, all of which are prepared by gourmet chefs and approved by dietitians. My favorite factor meal this week was the creamy Parmesan chicken with broccoli and tomatoes. With 41 grams of protein and only 12 carbs, it was a tasty, lean meal, perfect for right after a workout. I also enjoyed the jalapeno popper burgers with cauliflower rice, which was also packed full of protein and had a nice kick to it. And these were totally hassle-free meals. There were no dishes, no cleanup afterwards. Factor updates their menus weekly, so there's always something new to try. They also have plenty of add-ons and stacks and smoothies. Now you can either choose specific meals or you can let Factor handle that for you based on your preferences, which is what I do. But my favorite thing about Factor is just how easy it is to get a meal on the table, a healthy meal on the table. You know, it's faster than delivery or takeout.

One more time, go to factor75.com and use the code MODEST50 to get 50% off your first factor box. Okay, let's get into the video. Now you might think that in order to look expensive, you have to dress head to toe in designer clothing. This isn't true. In fact, this sort of conspicuous consumption can backfire. It can make people think that you're trying too hard, which is true. And yeah, you'll often see the new rich signaling their newfound status with these overt displays of wealth. But if you look at old money, it's all about understated subtlety and patina. And that's what we're going for here. Less sizzle, more steak. And that'll be a theme throughout this video. So tip number one is to wear subdued colors. The simplest thing you can do to look wealthy is to avoid bright flashy colors and instead wear subdued subtle colors. I'm talking about neutrals like off white and navy and non colors like black and white and gray. These hues don't scream look at me, but they do command attention in a subtle and powerful way. I mean, there's a reason that black tie is black tie and not neon pink tie, right? And of course, you can always add more color with a statement piece or an accessory, but you can't remove color if your shirt is bright red. So when in doubt when it comes to color, less is more tip number two is to add texture. Now there's sort of a correlation between cost and texture. What I mean is lush, interesting fabrics tend to be more expensive. For example, wool has more texture than cotton and cashmere or alpaca has even more texture and depth than wool. You know, for shoes, suede is more interesting than rubber and high end leather develops an attractive, complex patina over time. You know, cheap leather just cracks and deteriorates. So if you want your outfits to look more expensive, try to add texture. It doesn't mean you have to buy sweaters made from 100% baby unicorn hair. There are plenty of affordable options for merino wool and even cashmere, you know, from brands like Everlane and Uniqlo. You can also just opt for more interesting fabrics like instead of twill, like your normal chino pants, try corduroy's, you know, instead of leather boots, go for suede instead of regular cotton, try waxed cotton. The cool thing is you really can't go overboard with texture and you can mix different textures for really interesting combinations. So feel free to go crazy. Tip number three is to choose patterns carefully. So another way to look expensive is to avoid large, bold patterns and instead stick with solid colors and more subtle, small scale patterns. Plus, if you have enough texture, you really don't need patterns. But if you do like patterns, try to avoid things like plaid and gingham. They're just so commonplace. You know, there's a whole Instagram account dedicated to that J crew gingham shirt. gingham and plaid are just associated with middle class dudes. I'm not saying that's a bad thing or that plaid is a bad pattern, but it's not going to make you look rich. So if that is what you're going for, try to avoid those common patterns and go for something like a small scale houndstooth or subtle stripes or an all over print like floral, but you can never go wrong with solid colors, especially if the fabric itself has some interesting texture and pattern to it like chambray or corduroy or linen. Tip number four is to avoid visible logos. So aside from some new money, most wealthy people don't really try to advertise their wealth. Well, they do, but not blatantly. Also counterintuitively, most expensive clothing, even designer clothing, doesn't have logos all over it. In fact, there's direct correlation between price of a garment and the size of the logo on it. For example, look at the Ralph Lauren corporation. They have a bunch of different brands. Their lower tier brand chaps features huge logos on everything contrast that with double RL or purple label, which is Ralph Lauren's higher end brands. I mean, they're 10 times more expensive than chaps and they very rarely have any visible logos. So if you do want to look expensive, avoid visible logos at all costs, especially the big ones. The occasional small tasteful logo is totally fine. Just don't go overboard. Tip number five is to mix formalities. Try mixing formal and casual elements or garments in the same outfit. It's the old hyaluronic trick. I think this works best if you add one dressy piece to an otherwise casual outfit versus the For example, a dressy raincoat with a comfy athleisure type get up or a wool overcoat with jeans and a hoodie, you know, put on a sport coat over a casual crew neck, drawstring trousers and sneakers. Just be careful trying to do this in the other direction. Like some people can pull off wearing sneakers with a suit, for example, but it's not easy. Tip number six is to accessorize, but not too much. Coco Chanel famously said, before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off. Now she was talking about jewelry because she was speaking to women, but this applies to men too. When it comes to accessories, usually less is more. Like for me, I like wearing my wedding band, my watch, some sunglasses and sometimes a simple bracelet on my other wrist. Anything more than that starts to feel a little bit too attention grabbing and blingy. I mean, even if you just wear one accessory, like a nice watch, that's enough. And if you can't afford the luxury tier of accessories like watches, that's fine. My advice would be to buy the highest quality that you can afford at a given time and make sure to buy something you like. Never get into credit card debt for the sake of fashion. Okay, that's not going to make you look rich, but it will make you actually poor. And finally, my last tip is to adopt a uniform. In other words, wear the same stuff over and over. Have a uniform, have one or two staple pieces that you just wear all the time. I'm not saying you have to go full Steve jobs, but I'm not saying you shouldn't. The point is wealthy people aren't buying a whole new wardrobe from H&M every month. They're usually spending more money on higher quality pieces, and they're wearing them a lot. They're not thinking about what new outfit to put together every day, probably because they're more focused on, you know, making money. So wear the same jacket every day. Wear the same watch every day for 10 years. Wear some version of the same outfit four times a week. And once you do settle on certain things that you want to wear a lot, upgrade them over time. You know, you only need one nice pair of leather sneakers. You only need one good pair of go to sunglasses. And the added benefit of this approach is that it makes getting dressed a lot easier because you have fewer decisions to make. One more bonus tip, don't skimp on your haircut. If you look at photos of celebrities on the red carpets or even just paparazzi pictures of, you know, rich people running around LA, they always have nice haircuts. Through my work here on YouTube, I've been lucky enough to visit a couple of higher end salons. And let me tell you, when you go to someone who really knows what they're doing and they can look at your face and head shape and give you a haircut that really flatters your features, man, it's a game changer. And this is one thing that a lot of wealthy people do. They spend a little bit more money on their haircuts. So if you've been getting that $15 hair cuttery haircut for the last few years, just go to a high end salon at least just once, get the consultation. And I think you'll learn a lot about which hairstyle works for you. If you follow just a couple of those, you're going to look like a million dollars regardless of what's in your wallet. Thank you to Factor again for sponsoring the video. I'll link them down below in the description along with the discount code. And I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic. So leave them down in the comments section. Thank you as always for watching. And until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Every time I'm on Amazon, I see ads for this one wallet. It's the Buffway Slim Minimalist front pocket RFID blocking leather wallet. And honestly, I just always assumed that it was garbage. Why? Well, it's insanely cheap for a leather wallet. Plus the brand name is weird. It's one of those classic Amazon brand names that sounds vaguely familiar, but not quite right. Buffway. Like it sort of sounds like the high end wallet brand Bellroy, but something's off. Like whoever came up with it was clearly not a native English speaker. Even the product description is a bit wonky. Quote, our RFID front pocket slim wallet is super thin and modernly slim. Crafted out of leather, our minimalist wallet sleeve combines luxurious style and the trends of today. But branding aside, the wallet is crazy popular. It has over 89,000 reviews at the time of making this video and an overall rating of 4.6 out of five stars. I mean, that's insane. Either these are fake reviews or people have very low standards for wallets or it's actually a really good wallet. I had to find out, so I bought one. I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm gonna share my thoughts in this video. First, big thank you to today's sponsor, Ritual. I don't know about you, but my diet isn't perfect. It's not bad, but I'm definitely not getting 100% of the nutrients that I need every day. Ritual fills the gaps in your diet with their daily multivitamin. It doesn't have any additives or fillers or colorants, just 10 important ingredients, including vitamin A, omega-3 and zinc that support your health. I like these multivitamins because they're easy to swallow. They don't taste bad. They actually have this subtle mint flavor and they're easy on my stomach, even when I take them without any food, like first thing in the morning or before bed. I like Ritual as a company because their products are based on research and they're super transparent about where they source their ingredients. I love the fact that they have a scientific advisory board with actual scientists and nutritionists and medical doctors. You know, this company isn't making any crazy, unfounded claims about the benefits of their products. They're not including a bunch of weird, unnecessary ingredients. Ritual is sort of a breath of fresh air in the supplement industry. The other nice thing about Ritual is the fact that they deliver these products right to your door each month. So it makes getting into the habit of taking a multivitamin very easy, a Ritual, if you will. So if you wanna fill the gaps in your diet with essential for men, you can get 20% off your first month with Ritual by going to ritual.com slash modestman20 and using the code modestman20 for the discount. One more time, that's ritual.com slash modestman20 and use the code modestman20 at checkout. Okay, let's talk about Amazon's favorite wallet. First, let me just tell you what I like and don't like about it, what I like. The form factor is actually pretty good. It has many separate slots that are meant to hold like one individual card. You could easily fit some cash and eight cards in this wallet without doubling up on any slots. I also like the ID window. Granted, I don't get carded that much these days due to the grays, but I do like having a transparent window for your ID just makes it a little easier to show your ID. I like the price. I mean, personally, I'm willing to pay a bit more for higher quality stuff, but you can't argue with a sub $20 price tag. This wallet wouldn't be prohibitively expensive for anybody. I also like the fact that this wallet is just a little bit stiff at first. This is usually a good sign for wallets. Means it's gonna break in nicely over time. You know, if a wallet is too loosey-goosey right out of the box, it might loosen up too much and then your cards will start sliding out on their own. But I don't like everything about this wallet. First of all, even though it's a card holder, so it's like a slim, minimalist wallet, it's actually not that small. If you compare it, for example, to my go-to wallet for the past few years, the Anson Calder card holder, it looks pretty big. Even up against my iPhone 13 mini, it's just large. Now, the advantage of this larger size compared to my Anson Calder wallet is you can keep cash in this wallet, just fold it in half and it's not gonna stick out. But I don't carry that much cash and I don't mind folding it twice, so this isn't really a benefit for me. Granted, the extra space could come in handy if you carry like a couple of receipts or if you carry gift cards or other cards. But for me, someone who carries, you know, three credit cards and ID, couple of insurance cards and a little bit of cash, this wallet is actually overkill. But that's a small complaint. My main gripe with this wallet is it just feels cheap. I mean, it is cheap, so that's not surprising. But like, it's definitely not leather. Like this is some other material. If it is leather, that's a bad sign. I know they do make leather versions, but this one doesn't feel like leather to me. And also, if they're leather versions at this price, they're probably gonna be like bonded or genuine leather, which is the lowest grade of leather. And the problem with these cheap materials is that they typically don't age well. So if you're gonna use something every day, like our wallet, we use it multiple times a day and we kind of abuse them, cheap materials aren't gonna last. And you can just kind of feel the crunchy, plasticky kind of characteristics of this wallet. I'd honestly be shocked if it lasted more than a year without threads coming loose or the ID window starting to crack. So should you buy the Buffway Slim Minimalist wallet? It kind of depends on your approach to buying things. If you sort of drive with the buy it for life mentality, this is not the wallet for you. I mean, you can spend a little more, not that much more like $50 and you can get a full grain leather wallet that comes with a solid warranty. If you prefer to know where and how your products are made, this wallet isn't for you. Granted, it's made in China, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but at this price, I wouldn't expect or I wouldn't assume the best working conditions. If you care about brand, you know, Buffway isn't exactly aspirational. On the other hand, if you just want a cheap slim wallet, you don't care if it's mass produced or feels a little cheap, it's a pretty good choice. The design, the actual form factor is pretty clever and I think it works really well. If you've always carried a thicker buy fold or try fold and you want to test out the slim card holder format without spending a lot of money, this is a good way to do that. I'd probably go with this synthetic version over a leather version unless you like one of the other colors. Better yet, just buy one of the copycats. Believe it or not, there's actually cheaper versions of this wallet from other weird Amazon brands like Travel Lambo. Either way, I think you often get what you pay for when it comes to this sort of thing and that's very much true with this slim wallet from Buffway. So that's my review. You know, for me, it's a pass. I don't think it's a terrible wallet, but I'd rather spend a little more and get something a little better. But I'd love to hear from you. Would you buy this Buffway wallet? Let me know down in the comment section. Thanks again to RichRule for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " The first watch I wore regularly was this 40 millimeter all black quartz watch from a brand called The Fifth. Yeah, I know, it was a fashion watch. I didn't know anything back then, alright? They offered a sponsor a blog post. I took some cringy photos wearing the watch. My point is, I inevitably went down the watch rabbit hole and I ended up with a 38 millimeter Hamilton khaki. It actually seemed kind of small at the time, despite the long lug to lug. Then, I got a 37 and a half millimeter SKX-013. That was my daily driver for a long time, still my go-to travel watch. I was loving the smaller cases. I ended up with a 36 millimeter vintage Datejust. And since then, I've worn even smaller watches, like 35 millimeters and 34 millimeters, and I'm never going back to big watches. Obviously, watch size depends a little bit on wrist size, but here's the thing about small watches. They work well on larger wrists, too. We've all seen that picture of Muhammad Ali wearing the little Cartier tank, and the same can't be said for large watches. In other words, large watches only look good on large wrists, but a small watch looks good on any wrist. I see guys all the time asking on Reddit, does this watch look too big for me? And the answer is almost always yes. And if you're wondering whether or not a watch is too big for your wrist, it probably is. So, I'm on a mission to convince guys that when it comes to watches, size does matter and bigger is not always better. So, in this video, I'm going to give you six reasons why I love wearing smaller watches. First, huge thank you to today's sponsor, Factor. Factor makes it easy to eat healthy and to reach your nutrition goals. They do this by delivering fresh, never-frozen, tasty meals right to your door. The best part is, there's no prep needed. Factor meals arrive pre-prepared and ready to eat in two minutes. Factor is actually owned by my favorite Meal Kit delivery service, HelloFresh. They're both great. It just kind of depends what you're in the mood for. If you don't want to cook or clean, Factor is a great option. They offer keto, calorie smart, veggie and vegan and protein plus meals. All of these are prepared by gourmet chefs. They're all approved by registered dietitians. Recently, my favorite Factor meal was this spicy sweet potatoes and peanut sauce with coconut rice and miso roasted green beans. Sort of a sucker for this kind of dish. You know, the combination of lime and ginger and chili and coconut is just so good. My wife, who prefers plant-based meals, also really enjoyed the caramelized onion and goat cheese risotto with roasted carrots. And the best part is, there were no dishes to clean up after we were done eating. Factor updates their menus weekly, so there's always something exciting and new to try, including a bunch of add-ons and snacks and smoothies. You can either choose specific meals or let Factor choose for you depending on your dietary preferences. My favorite thing about Factor is just how easy it is to get a meal on the table. It's faster than delivery. It feels way healthier than takeout. So if you want to try Factor for yourself, head to factor75.com and use the code MODEST60 for 60% off your first Factor box. One more time, go to factor75.com and use the code MODEST60 for 60% off your first Factor box. Okay, the first reason why I love wearing smaller watches is because I have smaller wrists. You know, my wrists are like 6.3 inches around at the widest point. And so just like my clothing, you know, I want my accessories to fit. I want them to be in proportion with my build. In the same way that I would never wear 34-inch inseam jeans because they would make me look ridiculously short, I never want to wear a huge bulky oversized watch that's going to make my wrist and hands look tiny. Think about it, it would be like the rock wearing a skinny tie. It just doesn't make sense. That's one of the reasons that women's watches are traditionally a little bit smaller than men's watches. In general, women have smaller wrists and hands than men do. And so manufacturers make sure that their watches are a little bit smaller, in proportion. So I like wearing smaller watches that make sense on my frame regardless of what's currently on trend. Speaking of trends, reason number two is that fashion watches tend to be huge. Now, fashion watches include everything from cheap internet brands like Movement and Daniel Wellington to department store mainstays like Michael Kors and Tommy Hilfiger. These fashion watches are typically made in China. They're usually powered by cheap quartz movements. They're almost always oversized, like at least 42 millimeters, even all the way up to 50 millimeters or bigger. And there's no reason for them to be so large. In other words, they're artificially oversized, except for these brands are trying to market them as masculine. Think about it. Why would a minimalist watch that has no complications that's powered by a tiny little quartz movement need to have a 44 millimeter case? It doesn't make any sense. It's like a huge car with a tiny engine. You open it up and it's just empty space inside. In contrast, if you look at men's watches from the early and mid 1900s, many of them fall in like the 32 to 37 millimeter case size. And these are mechanical watches with intricate movements packed inside these small cases. You know, when you open up these watches, you don't find empty space inside. And in fact, many watch manufacturers pride themselves on being able to fit mechanical movements and complicated movements inside small, thin cases. I mean, look at this 35 millimeter Nomos. This is an automatic movement. This case is tiny. It's an amazing feat of engineering. And it's not like guys had smaller wrists in the 50s, 60s and 70s. They just didn't have this desire fueled by marketing for bulky, oversized watches. So personally, I'll take a $100 37 millimeter automatic Seiko over some 44 millimeter quartz movement watch any day of the week. Everything about it is better, including the price. Speaking of which, small watches are less expensive. Now, this is especially true for luxury watches that are made with expensive materials like proprietary steel or titanium or precious metals like gold. A smaller watch requires less material, so it's cheaper to produce. Look at the vintage Rolex market, for example. Two of the cheapest Rolexes that you can buy are the 34 millimeter date and the 34 millimeter air king. You know, the 36 millimeter Datejust isn't that much more expensive. Now you compare these to the larger Submariners and the Explorer II and the GMTs. I mean, those are way more expensive than their smaller brothers. So the correlation between size and price is real. And the thing is these smaller Rolexes hold their value just as well as the bigger ones. Not to mention ladies and unisex watches are often a lot cheaper than men's watches, even though they're not that much different. For example, the 34 millimeter oyster perpetual, which is a unisex watch, is a lot cheaper than the 36 or the 39 millimeter. Or look at Omega's classic Speedmaster watch. The speedy reduced, which is the smaller version, is widely available for a lower price. Same goes for entry level watches like the Seiko SKX, the classic dive watch from Seiko. The 013 is a little smaller than the 007 and 009, and it's also cheaper. So I prefer smaller watches anyway, but if you go smaller, you usually end up saving a bit of cash. Reason number four is that smaller watches are tasteful and elegant. Now some guys want to stand out and they want to be noticed. For me, I like my style to kind of fly under the radar. Simple, understated, even basic. I don't often wear statement pieces because I'm not making a statement. Loud accessories and huge watches scream, look at me, but a small low profile watch just whispers, come a little closer, if you'd like. That's much more my speed, you know, especially nowadays in a sea of ugly, oversized fashion watches that you see all the time, I think a smaller watch is just more tasteful than ever. So if you want to set yourself apart from the pack in a classy way, go small. Reason number five is that small watches are timeless. Now, I know the idea of timeless style is a little bit inaccurate. Nothing we wear right now is still going to be cool in 500 years. Even the suit and tie is going to be replaced by some nanotech, athleisure jumpsuit. But as far as watches go, small and medium sized watches tend to have more staying power. You know, a 44 millimeter fashion watch is going to look absolutely ridiculous in 10 years if it's still running. But a 38 millimeter Hamilton khaki, that's going to look really good. It's just going to age like top shelf bourbon. A 36 millimeter vintage Rolex, that's going to look as good in 25 years as it did 25 years ago. 34 millimeter Seiko Precision or a little 36 millimeter Orient Bambino dress watch. These are going to look just as gorgeous in 10 years as they do today. And they'd have been perfectly acceptable in the 1940s or 50s. So if you want to buy stuff that has longevity, you know, this is the opposite of fast fashion, go for a small or mid sized watch. And finally, reason number six is that anybody can wear a smaller watch. I've never seen a 38 millimeter watch look too small on anybody's wrist. But I've seen a 40 millimeter watch and a 42 millimeter watch look way too big for guys with slender wrists. The truth is anybody can wear a small watch, you know, even like a 36 millimeter watch is going to look just fine on a guy with a seven inch wrist. Not to mention these watches are super practical. They're comfortable. They slide right under your shirt sleeve. They're just easy to wear. In other words, small watches look great on big wrists, but big watches don't look great on small wrists. So when someone asked me, does this watch look too small? My answer is always no. If someone's trying to choose between a 36 and 39 millimeter version of the same watch, I pretty much always try to steer them toward the smaller one. I don't know why guys are so paranoid about watch size. It's like in our heads, it's correlated with masculinity or something. And, you know, the size of your watch, the size of your wrist, your hands, the size of you has nothing to do with manliness. And when I see a big guy wearing a small dress watch, I have nothing but respect for him. To me, that's just a sign of confidence. You know, that guy is clearly comfortable with his appearance. But when I see any guy wearing some 50 millimeter, you know, blingy watch, I just, I don't know, I can't help with think that he's trying too hard. So those are just six reasons why I love wearing smaller watches. You know, I've been wearing this little 35 millimeter NOMOS for a few weeks now as my daily driver. And I just love it. It's so comfortable. And, you know, for me, 38 millimeters is basically my upper limit. I don't think I'll ever wear a 40 millimeter watch or anything bigger than that. But I would love to hear from you. What do you think about watch size? Do you like wearing smaller watches? Let me know down in the comment section.

        "transcript": " When it comes to buying a suit, suit supply has been my go-to recommendation for many years now. If a friend asks me to help them buy a suit for their wedding, for example, I usually take them to suit supply. I've even taken my own brothers and brothers-in-law to suit supply to get suited up for their wedding. I choose suit supply for three reasons. Number one, for the money suit supply makes some of the best suits that you can buy. Number two, they have something for everyone between all the different styles and the wide range of sizes and of course their custom made program. Anybody can find clothes that fit really well at suit supply, you know clothes that really flatter your build. Reason number three, I trust the people who work at suit supply to take good care of their customers. I can take someone to suit supply and just leave them with a stylist and I know that they're in good hands. They're not going to be pressured into buying a suit that doesn't fit well or spending more than they want to. I'm even a customer of suit supply. I've bought suits there for myself way before I ever worked with them. If you haven't seen my suit supply custom review, which was not sponsored by the way, go check that out. It's a very thorough review and the bottom line is I was very happy with the results. The custom suit and the overcoat that I got both fit perfectly. All of that to say, I'm very excited to work with suit supply today. This time around they are sponsoring this video so huge thank you to them for supporting the channel. So for this video, I wanted to show you what it's actually like to shop at suit supply, especially if you get a chance to visit one of their physical locations. I spent some time at their Scottsdale store where Noah and the rest of the team helped me pick out some items from their ready to wear collection and design a few custom pieces. One thing I really like about suit supply is the seamless transition between online and in-person shopping. For example, you can use their custom made tool on their website to design shirts, jackets and coats and suits online and then you can finish your designs or get fitted in person at one of their stores. They'll help you nail down your sizing and update your size passport so future purchases are guaranteed to fit perfectly. Plus, if you do buy something ready to wear that needs alterations like getting your suit pants hemmed or getting shirt sleeves shortened. Suit supply has in-house tailors that can handle all of this stuff for you so you don't have to go find your own tailor. The store I visited is in Scottsdale Quarter. It's an open-air mall near Phoenix, Arizona and it's a really bright spacious second floor shop with a cool patio area that you can hang out on and enjoy a coffee. Inside, they had all of their core collections on display. They also had a lot of seasonal items from their fall winter collection and that included plenty of warm fabrics like wool, cashmere and corduroy, casual tailoring and lots of earth tones like off-white and brown. I spent some time wandering around the store with Noah and just getting a feel for the collection. Then I tried on a few ready-to-wear pieces, mostly casual items like jeans and sweaters and after that we decided to go custom for some pants, shirts and jackets. I really love that this is an option because for somebody like me who's five, six and shoes and 120 pounds soaking wet, it's really hard to find clothes that fit well off the rack. So the ability to go custom and to get that perfect fit is really a game changer. Noah had me put on some trial garments to make sure that my size passport was up to date. We actually made some minor tweaks to my size profile based on my current build and changing preferences. Then came the best part, choosing fabrics. I gotta say for this part, the outdoor patio came in really handy. We actually took the fabric books outside just to get a sense of what these fabrics would look like under the daylight and in the sunshine. You should definitely do this if you can, especially if you're buying a suit that you're going to wear outside at a wedding. You know, a lot of fabrics look totally different inside and outside. After choosing fabrics, Noah guided me through all of the different customization options for my jacket, pants and shirts. You can really geek out with all the options, everything from the shoulder construction to the waistband design and of course the jacket lining and the monogramming. And after going through all that, my job was pretty much done. The custom order would be shipped right to my front door in just a few weeks. I'm happy to say that once again, suit supply did not disappoint. So for the rest of the video, I'm going to put together some outfits using everything that I got from this haul, including the ready to wear stuff and the custom items. I didn't plan these outfits out in advance and they're really in no particular order. You know, most of these pieces are pretty interchangeable. So I'm just kind of trying on different combinations to see what works. So this is the exact process I use to put together an outfit. So let's start with these mid gray Aims drawstring trousers. They're kind of like a midweight Chino material and I left them unhemmed so I could cuff them and wear them casually with sneakers. They go perfectly with this light gray sweater that's made from an ultra soft blend of cotton and silk. I'm wearing off white unlined suede sneakers, which are also from Suitsupply and they're a nice kind of subtle alternative to plain white leather sneakers. To smarten things up a little bit, I added a charcoal and navy gun check sport coat. So this is one of the custom pieces and I've always loved this gun check pattern, especially in charcoal and navy colors go with everything and I've always wanted a jacket like this. When I was customizing this jacket, Noah and I decided to take it in a casual direction. One thing that can really help make your jackets more casual is the shoulders. So instead of going with like a structured shoulder with a lot of padding, I went with a soft natural shoulder and Suitsupply has more shoulder options than I think any other made to measure brand that I've tried. So this jacket almost feels like you're wearing a card again. It's extremely comfortable and this is just a cool smart casual look that you know is a bit elevated, but it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. Of course, you could wear this sweater with more casual pants like these medium wash made in Italy jeans and these work really well with casual chukka boots. But to change things up, I switched out the sweater for a buttonless long sleeve polo in a darker gray. This wool cashmere polo wears more like a sweater than a polo shirt. A dark brown quilted down vest finishes this outfit off nicely along with some mid brown boots. My favorite thing about chinos is how versatile they are. Just throw on a button-up shirt, a casual sport coat and some loafers and you've got yourself a modern business casual getup. I like these beige loafers, but I decided to swap them out for these chocolate brown tassel loafers, which are even sharper. By the way, this shirt is made to measure as well. So everything from the fabric and the buttons to the collar style and the placket style, it's all custom. The inky mid blue denim is surprisingly adaptable. It works especially well alongside other really textured fabrics like corduroy. Speaking of corduroy, these pants are also from the custom program. They're extremely comfortable. I went with a slightly higher waist, which I think wears really nicely, especially with tucked in shirts. I don't have a ton of experience with corduroy pants, so I wanted to try a few different books with this pair. First, I swapped the denim button down for a wool cashmere turtleneck in a true navy, like a dark navy color. This roll neck can be dressed up or down. So for example, you could wear it as a base layer under a denim shirt with sneakers, and it's kind of a casual and sporty look. You could wear it with that brown down vest and boots, and then it looks a little more outdoorsy and rugged. You could elevate the vest by swapping the boots for those brown tassel loafers, and I actually really like this look. Then swap the vest for the sport coat and you're ready for the office holiday party. Of course, if you really want to dress things up, you got to swap out those corduroy for something more refined. A pair of trusty charcoal wool dress bands should do the trick. This dark palette of gray and navy charcoal and chocolate is great for any dressy evening event, but the textures and the heavier fabrics make this specific outfit perfect for fall and winter. And of course, if it's cold outside, you're going to need some outerwear, and a casual parka just won't do. Go for a wool overcoat like this one from Suitsupply as a custom made program. It's a light gray single breasted pure cashmere overcoat that's unadorned except for a martingale strap on the back that you can use to cinch the waist. This coat is cut large enough in the shoulders and the sleeves to accommodate a suit jacket or a sport coat underneath, but it's tailored enough to wear over a sweater. The sturdy collar can be stood up for a more dashing look. And one cool thing about this type of top coat, especially in light gray, is it's surprisingly easy to dress down, so you can get more wear out of it than you might assume. For example, keep the trousers put on that denim shirt from earlier and you've got yourself a nice business casual look. Or keep the turtleneck, but swap the trousers for jeans and you're ready for a smart casual date night. It's just a really versatile piece, pretty much like everything else I tried on for this video. Everything Suitsupply makes is so easy to pair. I could easily put together another five to 10 outfits with this set of clothing. And that's one of the many reasons that I love Suitsupply and why I'm always talking about them is they just know how to make guys look amazing. So whether you go through their custom made program to get the perfect tuxedo or suit for your wedding, or if you just want to upgrade some of your casual wardrobe staples, I highly recommend considering Suitsupply. If you can, go visit one of their retail locations. It's just a really enjoyable low pressure shopping experience. But if that's not possible, go check out their website. You know, play with the custom made tool, play with their look builder, you can make a purchase right from your laptop, or you can save items for later and then finish your shopping in a store. So that's it for this video. If you have any questions for me about Suitsupply or anything else, any of the looks that you saw in this video, let me know down in the comment section. Thanks to Suitsupply one more time for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. And thank you as always for watching. Until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Color is probably the most confusing part of dressing well. The wrong colors or color combinations will detract from an outfit even if the individual pieces are solid. And colors confusing, there are so many to choose from, the combinations are literally infinite. And we could talk for hours about color theory and get into the science of skin tone and contrast levels and I actually do have a longer video about all that stuff if you want to go check it out. But in this video, I'm just going to give you a long list of examples of actual color combinations that you can wear today. And a lot of these combos, you probably already own these colors, so it's just about combining them in the right way. These combos work for any body type, any skin tone, any height, or weight, or gender. So I hope you discover some new ideas. By the way, there's one popular color combination that is not on this list and in my opinion, it's highly overrated. If you can guess what it is, let me know down in the comment section or just watch until the end. By the way, this video is sponsored by Karl Friedrich. I'm going to talk about their Palacy Weekend Bag in a little bit, but first, let's get into the combos. I'll start with the most popular clothing color, which is blue. First combo is blue and blue. Monochromatic color schemes aren't always the easiest to pull off, but this one is easy. The key here is to have enough contrast with shades. So like medium blue and dark blue or light blue and dark blue. Think dark wash jeans with a light blue Oxford cloth shirt. This looked good 20 years ago. It looks good right now and it's going to look good 20 years from now. Next up is blue and gray. This is another solid, very easy to wear combo that you no doubt have in your closet. For example, light wash jeans with a gray, crew neck t-shirt or casual button up shirt. Bonus points if the gray has some texture to it. Blue and green is another solid combo. These are analogous colors, meaning they're neighbors on the color wheel. So they're very easy to combine and this is a natural color, you know, blue and green, forest and ocean. Nature doesn't screw up color combination. So if you see it out in the wild, it's probably a good color combo to wear. This works equally well with darker, more saturated hues like navy and forest or emerald green and it works with lighter hues like olive and sky blue. Light blue and tan. So speaking of light blue, try pairing it with tan or khaki for a simple, classic palette that's never going to go out of style. You can dress this up if you think like khaki trousers and a light blue dress shirt, classic business casual look where you can dress it down, chino shorts and a light blue tee or polo. Blue and brown. Darker blue works really well with brown. Dark brown and navy is an especially nice combo. It's sophisticated, it's slimming, but it's warmer than wearing like black and charcoal. This works for casual outfits like chinos or corduroy with a sweater over a button up shirt or dress your outfits like a three-piece suit with a wool top coat. Blue and burgundy or maroon or merlot. Really any darker red color. Blue works well with complementary colors so blue and green is analogous, blue and red are complementary. These colors are on the opposite sides of the color wheel. For example, blue and dark red like burgundy, maroon, merlot, whatever you want to call it, it's classic, it's almost like a collegiate pairing, it's perfect for fall and winter. Finally blue and burnt orange. This is similar to blue and burgundy, but you know the key is not to go like too orange. We're not talking about traffic cone orange. We're talking about like a rich kind of burnt orange that brings to mind the changing autumn leaves. If you've been wanting to add more color to your wardrobe, these dark reds and oranges are good options. They actually look good on a wide variety of skin tones. Okay, so next up we're going to talk about combinations using the color green, but first I want to talk about today's sponsor, Carl Friedrich. I've used a Carl Friedrich laptop bag for many years now and then not too long ago, I made a video featuring their Carry On Pro, so I have a lot of experience with brand. I can vouch for the quality and the thoughtful product design. Today I want to show you one of their best sellers, the Palacy Weekend Bag. This is an upright duffel, so it has some structure to it. It doesn't kind of collapse in on itself. It's made from Italian Vecchetta leather, which is full grain vegetable tanned leather from Tuscany. Very durable leather, it's going to get better and better the more you use it. This bag also has luxury quality hardware, for example, the zippers are at a conny, probably butchered that but wanted to give it a shot, but they're just so smooth and reliable. They never get caught and they're really just a pleasure to actually like open and close. I really like the size of this bag. It's big enough for a couple of days away, you know, a couple of outfits and a pair of shoes. It's perfect for road trips, long weekend getaways, and it has some organization built in but unlike a lot of duffels and weekenders, it's not over designed. It has the right number of compartments, you know, it has an internal zip compartment for your valuables. It has that external pocket for anything you need quick access to, but it's relatively simple. I also love the cognac color. It goes perfect with any outfit from blue jeans and a t-shirt to a suit. It would work well with any of the color combinations I'll talk about in this video. The Carl Friedrich Palacy Weekend Bag comes with a 100 day trial, a lifetime warranty, worldwide shipping and top notch customer service. So if you're in the market for a new weekend bag or duffel and you want something a little higher end, I definitely recommend checking out Carl Friedrich. I will link to this bag and any valid discount codes down in the description. Thanks again to Carl Friedrich for supporting the channel. Okay, let's talk about color combos using one of my favorite colors, green. First up, green and brown. Green and brown. This is an earthy combo that works really well with, you know, richer hues or more subtle hues like these. For example, rich brown corduroy pants with a dark olive waxed field jacket. That's a beautiful combo. On the lighter side, tan chinos with a green flannel button down shirt. And by the way, both of these colors look really good with blue. So you can pair green and brown with like blue pants or a blue shirt or jacket and it's going to look good. Green and gray is another sophisticated color combination that you don't see too often out in the wild. So it's a good way to kind of set yourself apart without screaming, look at me. Just like brown, gray goes well with pretty much any shade of blue. So if you're wearing green and gray somewhere in your outfit, you can add a blue very easily. Finally, pairing green with pink is a smart way to use complementary colors to your advantage. This is easiest to pull off if you keep both colors kind of subtle and unsaturated. For example, olive and a light kind of washed out pink. This looks so good, especially during spring and summer. And of course you can pull off the darker, more saturated versions of green and pink, but it's going to work especially well with darker skin tones. Okay, let's run through some combos that use black as a base. First up, black and gray. You know, this is your classic monochromatic gray scale color palette. This can be used for casual outfits like a gray t-shirt with black jeans or black sneakers, but it really shines once you get into kind of smart casual and formal wear. Think like a gray suit with a black shirt or turtleneck. It's a very sharp look. It's much tougher than your classic black suit with a white shirt. And by the way, this is one of the only times that you can wear a black dress shirt without looking like part of the wait staff. So keep that in mind. By the way, don't try to do the reverse. Don't try to wear a black suit with a gray shirt or just as bad a black tie. This has never looked good on anybody. Next up, black and dark green. We talked about pairing green with gray, but black works just as well. After all, black is really just dark gray, right? Or is gray light black? I don't know. Let me know what you think down in the comments. Either way, dark green and black look really cool together. This is a refined but still kind of edgy combination and you don't see many guys wearing it. So if you wear black jeans a lot, you know, try wearing a dark green shirt sometime. Similarly, black works well with darker shades of red. I mean really dark, like black and burgundy. You know, you do not want to wear black and bright red. You know, it's a little too vampire-esque. But if you go with like black and a rich dark burgundy, that's a really classy combo. You know, you wear that, people are going to think you listen to obscure classical music and you own expensive art. If you really want to stand out at a formal event, try wearing a burgundy suit with a black tie and black shoes instead of your classic black suit. Gray and purple. This is kind of like the cooler version of the light blue and khaki business casual uniform. It works really well with like slacks and button-up shirts. I wouldn't wear this with a jacket and a tie, but with no jacket and no tie with first couple buttons undone, really solid look. Go with light or medium gray pants and an unsaturated purple shirt. You don't want to wear anything too rich or dark. The cool thing is you can wear black shoes with this or burgundy shoes or even lighter brown shoes. So very versatile color combination. Last up for this section, charcoal and navy. Speaking of office wear, you can never go wrong combining charcoal and navy. For example, charcoal wool dress pants with a navy sweater worn over a white shirt. That's a classic fall winter office look that's always going to look refined and put together. For a slightly dressier look, you could go with a navy blazer instead of the sweater. You could even add a necktie if you have a big meeting. Wear these colors with black or burgundy shoes or for a really sharp look, wear them with chocolate or like midnight brown suede loafers. That's a nice look. Finally, let's look at some earthy color combinations using shades of brown like tan, off-white and cream. By the way, when I say white, I really just mean any type of white like off-white, cream, beige or even khaki. So first up, tan and white. Pairing white with tan or khaki is a can't go wrong summer business casual outfit. Think like tan cotton dress pants with a white button up shirt or polo. Of course, instead of white, you could also wear very light blue, which has the same effect, it works better for certain skin tones since it creates less contrast. If that combo is too basic, you can wear light yellow instead of white. Yellow is a really warm color, so it works well with any shade of brown, including tan or khaki. More saturated yellows work well with darker browns and they look great if you have a darker or warmer skin tone. If you have lighter or fairer skin tone like I do, you probably want to avoid saturated bright yellow. Similarly, a pale washed out pink shirt looks great with white, cream or tan pants and shorts. Tan and pink. It's a solid color combination, kind of preppy, kind of nautical, but I think anybody can pull it off. For footwear, you could wear any shade of brown really is going to look good with this combo. You could also choose complementary colors like blue or olive. Next up, off-white and brown. So for going any real colors at all and just sticking with 100% earth tones, you know, a totally neutral outfit is a really sophisticated look. It makes you look expensive, you know, or like you really know what you're doing, even if you really don't. My friend Brian over at He Spoke Style is an expert at combining earthy tonal colors like this. He uses this palette all the time and he always looks good, but he never looks like he's trying too hard. Now pure bright white pants can be a little intimidating at first, so you know, if you want to test drive this combo, try buying some off-white or like light beige pants first and pair them with a tan shirt and brown shoes and whatever jacket you want. And finally, the last combo is brown and burgundy. Now black and burgundy, which we talked about, will have you feeling like a charming James Bond villain at a black tie gala. But brown and burgundy will have you feeling like a charming young, rich British lad exploring the countryside at his family's annual Fox Hunt. It's a really warm, inviting pairing and it works well with casual and smart casual outfits, especially during fall. Think like brown corduroy is in a chunky maroon sweater with brown leather boots and thick wool socks or tobacco chinos with a burgundy, pique polo and sneakers. I'm telling you, it's a solid combo if you haven't tried it yet. And that's it. So back to my original question, did you catch which combo I didn't include? If you guessed black and white, you're correct. In my opinion, black is one of the most overrated colors in menswear. Contrary to popular belief, black does not go with everything. And when you combine it with white, it's a very high contrast color combination and it really doesn't work for every body type and all skin tones. But that's a subject for another video. If you have any questions about the color combos that we discussed today, let me know down in the comments section. Or if I missed anything, leave a comment to let me know. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Chinos are my favorite type of pants. They're incredibly versatile. They're like the Swiss army knife of pants unlike jeans Chinos work for business casual outfits and unlike dress pants. They also work for casual outfits You can wear chinos with dress shirts or oxfords or casual button-ups You can also wear them with t-shirts and sneakers and even sandals If I could only choose one pair of pants to wear for the rest of my life It would be a pair of chinos But just like with any other pants style chinos aren't gonna look good if they don't fit properly So in this video, I'm gonna explain exactly how a pair of chinos should fit of course fit or silhouette is Subjects to trend sometimes skinny fit is in sometimes wider fits are all the rage I'm gonna try to give you advice that will stand the test of time So in this video, I'm gonna talk about a timeless Chino fit or at least as timeless as it gets and if you follow this advice if your chinos fit like I like mine to fit They're gonna look just as good in 10 years as they do today before we get into it big Thank you to Lestrange London for sponsoring this video I've been wearing the 24 trouser from Lestrange London for a couple of years now And if you watch my other videos chances are you may have seen me wearing these It's kind of like a classic chino pant but with some modern updates and amenities For example, these have a partially elasticated waistband a hook and button closure and a drawstring So it makes them incredibly comfortable to wear They're tailored but not skinny fit is about as timeless as it gets if you want more room You can go for a pair of their relaxed fit 24 trousers All of these are cut with a longer inseam and they're meant to be cuffed to your desired length Depending on the look you're going for in a given day or what kind of footwear you're wearing The material they're made from is very Cuffable and it works for any kind of cuff including an outside cuff or an inside cuff They're also very easy to hem or to get a permanent turn up if you like that look I also love that you can buy the 24 trouser in a variety of fabrics So they have a heavyweight cotton a linen wool flannel or their original six ounce stretch cotton So there's a comfortable option for every climate. I actually really like the way the heavyweight Trouser drapes, but I think the six ounce original fabric is probably good for most people What I really love about this pair of pants though is the quality a certified b-corp The strange London's motto is with less do more. So this is the opposite of fast fashion This brand is creating modular wardrobe staples that are easy to combine interchangeable and they're gonna last a long time so this includes t-shirts and knits and sweatshirts Blazers and outerwear I'll be using the 24 trouser from the strange as one example of Proper Chino fit in this video So if you like the way these pants look and you want to be a more thoughtful fashion consumer I definitely recommend checking out the strange London you can Google the strange London or you can click the link down below in the description Okay, let's talk about how your chinos should fit just like with anything else jeans t-shirts suits for going for a kind of Middle of the road slim, but not tight fit You don't want your pants to be squeezing your legs in but you do want them to follow the general shape of your body So for most of us guys This means a gentle taper from the hips down to the ankle starting at the top the waistband of your chinos Should be tight enough that you don't have to wear a belt to keep your pants up If you're not wearing a belt and you find yourself Constantly pulling your pants back up to where you want them to sit the waist is probably too loose now a loose waist can almost always be Fixed at the tailor and of course some chinos come with drawstrings like these ones from the strange London on the other hand The waist shouldn't be so tight that it's uncomfortable So when in doubt it's better for the waist to be a little bit too loose and use a belt or a drawstring to tighten it Versus a little bit too tight moving down to the hip So for most guys our hips are the widest parts of our lower body This is because our butt is usually wider in diameter than our waist or our thighs Now it's crucial that your chino pants aren't too tight around your hips Don't assume this can be fixed at the tailor sometimes There's not enough fabric to let the hips out if the hips are too tight You're gonna feel uncomfortable Especially when you go to sit down or bend over if the hips are too loose not that big of a deal Sure, if they're way too loose and you don't have a large bum You might get a little bit of that diaper butt effect But honestly that's preferable to your pants looking like they're too tight for me I don't often have this saggy diaper butt problem with pants For me usually if I get pants that fit in the waist a lot of times they're too tight in the hips It's just the way I'm shaped and the solution is usually to size up and then get the waist taken in One telltale sign that the hips are too tight is if your side pockets kind of flare out Also if the fabric is pulling across your lap creating these horizontal lines the hips are probably too tight I'm not saying your chinos have to be so loose that they totally hide the shape of your butt People love butts, but there should be a little bit of excess fabric maybe like an inch or two on either side Okay, we also have to talk about the seat or the crotch The way your pants fit in the seat is determined by their rise Rise is the distance from the top of the front waistband to the top of the back waistband when you see a rise measurement It's usually just referring to the front rise So that's the distance from the top of the front waistband to the crotch seam Low rise pants have a shorter distance say like eight inches high rise pants have a longer distance like 12 inches and that's because low rise pants are meant to sit down on your hips and Higher rise pants are meant to sit up near your belly button It's a mistake to get low rise pants and try to wear them higher up You can do it you can use a belt to make them sit higher up near your belly button, but it's gonna be uncomfortable because there's not enough Rise there's not enough room in the crotch. It's uncomfortable and it looks kind of weird This is why for most guys it makes sense to buy standard or medium rise pants or even higher rise pants They're more comfortable and they make your legs look longer because they raise your perceived waistline So it's a win-win now if you already own some chinos that are too low rise for you or that are too tight in the seat area They might be able to be fixed at a tailor, but only if there's excess fabric So you can check this yourself or you can bring them to a tailor, but don't be surprised if they can't be fixed Okay, moving down the legs to the thighs knees and calves Just like with the hips and the seat if your chinos are too tight in the thighs They're not gonna be comfortable. Even if it looks good on the model. Trust me. They're not comfortable This is especially true for pants that don't have a whole lot of stretch So a lot of chinos have like 2% stretch these days, but if it's a hundred percent cotton, you know It really has to have a more room basically the tighter your pants are the more stretch they should have So if you can see the outline of your quads Underneath your pants, they're probably too tight on the other hand If you can pinch one to two inches of excess fabric on the outside of your thigh, you're good to go now Unless you prefer a completely straight leg your chinos should be a little bit tighter around the knees Then they are around your thighs because your knees are smaller than your thighs You shouldn't see the outline of your kneecap unless you're sitting down and you shouldn't feel any restriction when you bend down or do a Squad the same pinch test works here too And of course this gentle taper continues down through the calf and again about an inch of excess fabric is just right now If you sit down and then you stand up and your chinos get stuck around your calf That means they're probably too tight. Remember, it's always good to prioritize function over form or comfort over style It's hard to be stylish if you don't feel comfortable because people can kind of sense that and finally let's talk about the leg opening So this is the narrowest part of your chinos. How narrow should it be? You ask It kind of depends on your build, you know, like how big are your ankles and how much taper do you want? I like a six and a half inch leg opening It works well cuffed or uncuffed with pretty much any type of sneaker or boot, but I have very thin calves and ankles So you might like a seven inch leg opening or even an eight inch leg opening either way The leg opening shouldn't be wider than the calf or the knee because then that that means you're gonna have kind of like a flared shape and While that's in style like once every 20 years or something I don't think it's a very good look It's also important to remember the relationship between leg opening and pants length wider leg openings or wider ankles tend to look better With longer pants that have more break the shorter your chinos are or the less break The more taper you're gonna want So if you want like slight break or no break at all like the crops look you're gonna want a tapered pant Speaking of which let's talk about how long your chinos should be when we talk about pants break We're talking about how much your pants stack up on top of your shoes Full break means a lot of stacking and folding on the other end of the spectrum is the cropped length And this is when your pants just hover above your shoes, so they don't even touch your shoes I think most guys look good with slight break or partial break This means that your chinos touch your shoes, but they don't pile up on top of them You know, I personally don't think it looks very good if your chinos are stacking up over top of your shoes I also like the no breaks look, you know Sometimes I'll cuff my chinos for that perfect no break look and I think it's a great look especially for more casual outfits I think the no break cuffed look also looks really good when you're wearing boots If you do want more break kind of a more traditional relaxed look Just make sure that your chinos aren't too tapered Finally, you might be wondering whether or not you should cuff your chinos If you're wearing them casually like with a t-shirt or a sweatshirt or an untucked shirt Yeah, feel free to cuff them if you like that look which I do I like how the added weight kind of helps my chinos drape So I'll cuff chinos with really any casual shoes from Casual loafer to a pair of sneakers or boots The only time I don't recommend cuffing chinos is if you're wearing them in a business casual setting So if you're wearing a pair of chinos with like a tucked in button down shirt Maybe even a jacket or without a jacket or tie But with like dressier shoes like an Oxford or a Brogue or a dress boot I wouldn't cuff them just get them hemmed that slight break length and that's it That is how your chinos should fit if you want them to look good today and 10 years from now Thanks one more time to the strange London for sponsoring this video and for making the 24 trousers One of my favorite pairs of pants and I definitely recommend checking them out If you have any questions for me about chinos fit or really anything else, let me know down in the comments Thank you as always for watching and until next time stay stylish"

        "transcript": " Whenever I go out into the world, I see plenty of guys who are put together and well dressed and seem pretty confident. Unfortunately, without fail, I see a lot of men who are poorly dressed who either don't know that they're poorly dressed or even worse, they don't care about clothing and don't care what other people think. Of course, there's really no such thing as not caring. We're all signaling something with our clothing choices and there's really nothing more ironic than trying to convince people how little you care. Thou doth protest too much, if you know what I mean. But I digress. These poorly dressed guys are easy to spot. They have certain tells that give them away instantly. In this video, I'm going to reveal those tells so you can make sure that you're not making any of these mistakes. And if as you're watching this video, you're thinking to yourself, wow, I don't make any of these mistakes. Well, congrats, you're probably one of the best dressed guys in the room. By the way, this video is sponsored by Karl Friedrich. In a little bit, I'm going to tell you about their Palisade Weekend Bag. But first, let's get to the first sign of a poorly dressed man. Number one, poor fit. The number one style mistake that men and women make is wearing clothes that don't fit their body. Now, to be clear, I'm not telling you that you have to wear fitted clothing. Slim fit does not equal proper fit. Looser, more relaxed fit clothing can fit properly. And these silhouettes can be flattering on certain body types, even more flattering than fitted clothes sometimes. For example, Ethan Wong dresses mostly in traditional straight fits and he always looks sharp. On the other hand, Brian Sakawa from He Spoke Style wears gently fitted clothing and he also looks great. Now, I tend to err on the side of slim fit, but regardless of silhouette, there is such a thing as bad fit. When you're pants or your sleeves are way too long, that's just incorrect. If your suit jacket is too tight, that's wrong. And if your necktie goes way past your waistband, that's not a good look. But the good news is bad fit is really easy to fix. You just take your clothes to the tailor and they fix them for you. This is actually cheaper and it's less wasteful than buying new clothes. So if you don't have a tailor that you trust and visit often, I recommend looking into that. I actually made a whole video about the process that I use to find a competent trustworthy tailor, so go check that out. Okay, before we move on, let's talk about today's sponsor, Carl Friedrich. I've been a fan of Carl Friedrich ever since I got my hands on one of their laptop bags a few years ago. Between that bag and then their newer Karyon Pro that I've been using for a few months, I can definitely vouch for the brand's quality. They're totally dedicated to thoughtful, high quality product design. Today, I want to show you one of their best sellers, the Palisade Weekend Bag. This structured duffel is made from Italian Vecchetta Leather, which is a full grain of vegetable tanned leather from Tuscany. This type of leather is incredibly durable and it gets better over time as it develops a patina with use. This bag also has luxury quality hardware. So these Raccogne zippers are reliably smooth. They're durable. By the way, I'm probably butchering that brand name, but these are some nice zippers. I love the size of this bag. You know, it's big enough for a couple of days away from home. It's perfect for like a weekend road trip or, you know, an overnight wedding. It has some organization built in, but unlike a lot of other brands, Carl Friedrich doesn't over design their bags. It has just the right number of compartments. I normally go for brown leather bags, but this black one is incredibly versatile. It goes with any outfit that I might wear to the airport and any other travel accessories that I might carry. The Carl Friedrich Policy Weekend Bag comes with a 100 day trial, a lifetime warranty, worldwide shipping and excellent customer service. So if you need to do weekend bag and you're looking for something higher end, I definitely recommend checking out Carl Friedrich. I'll link to this bag down below in the description along with any valid discounts. And thanks one more time to Carl Friedrich for supporting the channel. Okay, sign number two of a poorly dressed man, multiple visible logos. If you think about it, visible logos are kind of weird. It's like people pay money to a brand for a product, but then they walk around and give that same brand free advertising. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Like if a brand is going to put a logo on their shirt, shouldn't they pay you to walk around wearing it? Now I get it. Some brands are cool and people want to be associated with cool things. In many cases, people are really just trying to say, I can afford this expensive thing. Of course, in reality, designer logos are usually just a sign of massive credit card debt. But seriously, there's nothing wrong with this kind of subtle wealth signaling. Pretty much everybody does it. I do it. You know, I have a couple of nice watches and I'd be lying to you if I said that they weren't at least in part status symbols. Anybody that wears a Rolex and says that they're doing it just for the heritage, probably isn't being 100% truthful with themselves. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with a subtle flex, but it can go too far and when it does, it totally backfires. If you're wearing two to three different logos, especially designer logos, it comes across as trying way too hard. And the funny thing is people who really do have high status or a lot of wealth, they don't need to show it off. So I recommend avoiding logos really altogether. But if you do want to wear a logo, you know, stick to one tasteful logo. And make sure the brand really resonates with you. You know, I get it. If you want to wear a Ralph Lauren shirt with a little Ralph Lauren logo or LaCos Polo or something like that, or even some common project sneakers with a little gold lettering, you know, that's fine. Just don't be a billboard. Sign number three is too much color. Now it's not easy to combine a bunch of different colors into a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing outfit. This takes a creative eye, a lot of trial and error and education. And frankly, most people who try are not pulling it off. It's rare to see someone wearing more than two or three colors in a way that actually works well. So wearing a lot of colors at once is usually a mistake. Even wearing one or two really bright colors can be a mistake, especially for guys with really fair skin because it totally washes them out. Now most of the really well-dressed guys who I see out in the wild or on social media are only wearing like one or two colors and most of their wardrobe consists of neutrals. That's a lot of well-dressed guys just wear all neutral colors. You know, sometimes they'll throw in a small accent with an accessory, but you can go a long way with just black, white and gray and brown and, you know, olive, navy blue, cream, those kinds of menswear neutral colors. At the very least, these make a great foundation to add one bolder color. So my advice is to stick with one or two colors per fit and keep the rest of your outfit kind of neutral. Sign number four is mismatched formality. Now these days, it's okay to break the style rules and you usually don't have to dress to a specific dress code. For example, done correctly, sneakers can look okay with a suit. You know, a dressier watch can work with a more casual outfit, but for the most part, you want your outfit to be cohesive in terms of formality. You know, casual or business casual or black tie. One mistake I see all the time is guys mixing formalities, but not in an intentional way. For example, I'll see guys wearing boat shoes with like business casual outfits or even suits. This is a bad look, you know, boat shoes may seem like loafers, but they're not loafers. They're a very casual type of shoe and they totally ruin a business casual or a formal look. Another example is wearing a backpack with a suit. You know, it's just a mismatch. It's much better to carry a messenger bag or a briefcase, even a slim portfolio to keep your laptop and documents in. You know, these styles are much more in line with the formality of a suit and with the formality of wherever you're going in a suit. So unless you're making an intentional statement like wearing sneakers with a suit, you know, it's best to kind of try to avoid these formality mismatches. Sign number five is overly trendy outfits. Now there's nothing wrong with trends. Pretty much everything that anybody is wearing was at one point a trend and experimenting with trends, you know, picking up one or two pieces and seeing how they work for you is a great way to breathe new life into your wardrobe, but you never want to look like you just walked out of an H&M and you just bought everything on the mannequin. This makes it look like you're just trying really hard to be cool and relevant and on trend. It's kind of a subtle sign that says I don't really have a strong sense of personal style. So I'm just kind of wearing what these brands are telling me to wear. On a practical note, following trends that closely will almost guarantee that your wardrobe will need to be replaced every couple of years. The most stylish men I know tend to buy high quality versions of things that they know that they're going to get a lot of use out of, you know, that they're going to wear for five or 10 years. You know, for me, it's things like brown leather boots and white leather sneakers, slim straight chinos, dark blue jeans, casual button up shirts and wool overcoats. You know, these are going to last so long and they're going to outlast whatever is trendy right now. This kind of gets that developing a sense of personal style. And of course, your style can be influenced by specific trends. My style was heavily influenced by slim fit clothing and that trend, I still wear slim fit clothing, but it doesn't change that much from one season to the next. And sign number six is putting in zero effort. Now we've talked a little bit about trying too hard, but honestly, I think trying too hard is better than not trying at all. Effort is not bad. Yes, it can go too far. You can look too perfect. Your suit can be too tailored. If you don't have, you know, a hair out of place on your head and your suit's kind of tight and you're wearing 10 different accessories. Yeah, it might look like you're trying a little too hard. It might look like you care too much about your appearance. People are very sensitive to narcissism and it's a turn off. But I would argue that that's better than looking like you don't care at all. You know, if you ask a woman what they want a man to wear on a first date, they'll usually just say, I just want to look like he tried. But you know, these days I see a lot of guys who clearly just prioritize comfort over everything else. You know, guys wearing baggy cargo shorts, graphic tees that are a size too big, running sneakers even though they're not running anywhere, and a totally utilitarian haircut. I see guys at the airport in the grocery store wearing lounge pants and slides. It's like they just rolled out of bed and just started their day. You know, and at the risk of using a totally overplayed quote, Tom Ford famously said that dressing well is a form of good manners. And I kind of agree, you know, just like good manners or any form of etiquette, putting some care into your appearance is a way of respecting other people's feelings. It helps you get along with people, you know, it provides that social lubricant, especially with strangers who you've never met and who are judging you based on what you look like. Remember, your clothes are always working. They're either working for you or against you, but they're always working. So yeah, it's okay to care. It's okay to try. So that's it for today. And I'd love to hear from you, you know, in your opinion, what is a sign of a poorly dressed man? And on the flip side, what's one sign of a very well dressed guy? Share your thoughts down below in the comment section. If you have any questions for me, ask them in the comments. I'll do my best to answer. I read almost every comment except for the trolls. Thank you as always watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " If you spend any time on fashion TikTok, you may have noticed that oversized, loose fitting clothing is in. You may have even heard that skinny jeans are dead and that it's not cool, man, to wear slim fit clothes. Is this true? Should you get on board with the oversized trend? That's what this video is all about. Before we get into it, I wanna thank today's sponsor, Factor. Factor is all about healthy eating made simple. They deliver fresh, never frozen, healthy meals right to your door. And the best part is there's no prep needed. Factor meals arrive pre-prepared and ready to eat in two minutes. Factor is actually owned by my favorite meal kit delivery service, Hello Fresh. They're both great. It just kinda depends what you're in the mood for. If you don't want any prep or cleanup, Factor is the way to go. They offer keto, calorie smart, and plant-based meals like this smoked tofu almond stir fry. It's got edamame, basmani rice, peppers, mushrooms, and lots of other healthy ingredients. My wife and I also enjoyed this vegetable ratatouille with polenta and made for a quick and healthy lunch. The best part was there were no dishes to do afterwards. Factor meals offer plenty of variety with a weekly rotating menu of over 25 meals and add-ons. You can either choose specific meals or just let Factor handle that based on your preferences. I also love that Factor has detailed nutrition info on each meal. Helps me track my macros and calories for the day and make sure I'm hitting those protein goals after leg day. But my favorite thing about Factor is just how easy it is to get a meal on the table. It's faster than delivery. It feels way healthier than takeout. And since my wife is vegetarian, but I'm not, Factor offers plenty of tasty options for both of us. If you wanna try Factor, head over to go.factor75.com slash modest130 and use the code modest130 for $130 off across six boxes. One more time, head over to go.factor75.com slash modest130 and use the code modest130 for $130 off across six boxes. Okay, back to the video. So first of all, despite what the headlines say, skinny jeans are not dead. If you just look at the actual data and market forecasts, you'll see that skinny and slim fit jeans are by far the most popular styles. And this is true all around the world for men and women. Now, looser fits are trending and this specific trend was inevitable. The fashion industry relies on trends to stay alive. If people didn't feel any pressure to buy new clothes, then we would all just wear the same stuff until it wore out and that would be really bad for business. Now, this fashion cycle used to be a bi-annual cycle. So designers and brands would release two collections every year, one for spring, summer, and one for fall, winter. These days, fast fashion brands like Zara and H&M are releasing new collections every month, new items every week. And they're spending a ton of money trying to convince people like you and me that they have to buy these new things to be relevant and to feel cool. Now, it's not just the industry's fault. Of course, people's tastes do genuinely change over time. You know, sometimes just one person with enough influence like a celebrity might get into something new and this can cause a bit of a cultural shift in taste and aesthetic preference. Really, every generation causes this shift and there's nothing new under the sun. Think about it. What is fashion? What's trending right now is just a reinterpretation of 90s fashion. 90s fashion was heavily influenced by 1970s fashion and the 70s was a continuation of the 1960s hippie aesthetic. And you can trace this evolution all the way back to the days of tunics and pantaloons, which by the way, if humans are around long enough, will also be cool again one day. Now, I don't think this is necessarily bad. It's certainly not something that we have control over as the old saying goes, the only constant is change. And some people, usually younger people, welcome this change. Other people, usually older people, will resist it. Personally, I'm not opposed to the idea of fashion trends. I won't not wear something just because it's trendy, especially if it makes me look better. I mean, I remember when slim fit, cropped clothing became really popular, I was so happy because I could finally find clothes off the rack that really fit my build. But when a trend comes along that doesn't really work for me, I'm okay with opting out. And this is the case with several current trends, including the broccoli head hairstyle, the chunky dad sneakers, and of course, relaxed fit clothing. For me, I'm gonna ride out this wave in the same stuff that I've been wearing since 2013, and that's slim tapered pants, minimalist sneakers, not too many accessories, and a classic haircut. And when everybody is trying to sell their dad shoes and their oversized camp collar shirts on grailed, two years from now, I'm gonna be wearing the same thing. And I'll be ready for whatever trend to come next, which at this rate is probably low rise boot cut jeans. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you shouldn't experiment with looser fitted clothing. I think it can look really cool. And I have nothing but respect for people even here on YouTube who are into that look. You know, people like Jordan O'Brien, Parker York Smith, Fly With Johnny Tye, Harry Haas, Tim DeSaint, Daniel Simmons. These guys genuinely look cool, they look confident. I think they enjoy wearing these clothes. And honestly, they have probably helped nudge this trend into the mainstream. You should wear what you like, and if you feel like your current wardrobe doesn't really represent who you are, then definitely start experimenting with something else. But if you're happy with your clothes, keep wearing them. You know, I'm certainly not buying new trendy clothes and loose fits just to fit in. And if you still need some convincing, I'm gonna give you three specific reasons why I am skipping this specific trend. Number one, I don't like buying new clothes. So most trends start way up at the designer tier. It's very expensive to buy designer clothing. So it means if you wanna get these trendy pieces right off the runway, you're gonna have to drop some serious coins. So think like chunky Balenciaga sneakers. But the thing is these trends trickle down to fast fashion brands at a breakneck pace. Designers send samples to influencers who are really just a marketing channel. And then these influencers and other marketing campaigns create a mainstream demand for trendy pieces. Now, of course, most people can't afford designer price tags. So fast fashion brands scramble to get versions of these trendy pieces out as quickly as possible. This is literally a race to the bottom. So yes, you can buy affordable versions of these trendy pieces. You could switch your wardrobe out every two months. But think about the conditions under which these clothes were made. Probably horrible working conditions and probably from dirt cheap materials. So it's very difficult to participate in these trends without either spending a lot of money or contributing to unethical labor practices and the huge fashion waste problem. Really the best way to be an eco-friendly fashion consumer, short of joining a nudist colony, is to just buy fewer things. That means you have to wear your clothes longer. And if you wanna wear your clothes longer, you can't buy stuff that's not gonna look good in a year. The third reason why I'm skipping the oversized trend is because frankly, I think slim fit clothes just look better. Now here's where the debate becomes interesting and subjective. The thing is not everybody agrees on the role of style in our lives. Even amongst guys who are into how they dress, there's sort of two ends of the spectrum. On one end, you have the fashion lovers. These are people who see how they dress as a creative pursuit. They use their clothing to express themselves almost as if their artists and their body is the canvas. On the other end, we have the practical style crowd. These are people who use clothing as a tool. They wear clothes to fit into certain groups or environments. They wear clothes to be comfortable. They wear clothes that make them look as fit and as put together as possible. Now the fashion lovers have a hard time why anybody would take such a boring and logical approach to getting dressed. They reject the belief that clothing should enhance your perceived physique. The practical style crowd thinks that most fashion trends are utterly ridiculous. They would never intentionally wear something that wasn't just functional or that didn't make them look better. Both groups appreciate clothing but for very different reasons. And here's the thing, both groups are right. We don't have to agree on the role of clothing in our lives. And the important thing to remember is that these two groups of people and everybody in the middle actually have a lot in common. They appreciate clothing. They understand that clothing has the ability to influence our mood and our self image and how other people view us. Personally, I'm more on the practical end of the spectrum. I'm not really into fashion. I use style mostly as a tool, you know, just like fitness or communication skills. It's kind of one branch on the tree of personal development. It's something I have control over. So why not make sure that my clothes are working for me and not against me? And that means that I wear clothes that I think enhance my physique. And so as a slim guy, I wear slim fit clothes. I wear mostly understated neutral colors. And I pretty much only buy things that I think are gonna look as good as they do now in five or 10 years. But I would love to hear from you. I wanna get a discussion going down in the comments section. Are you trading in your slim fit jeans for more relaxed cuts? Are you buying oversized t-shirts? Share your thoughts with me down below in the comments. And if you enjoyed this discussion, do me a favor, share this video with a friend or just hit that like button.

        "transcript": " If you want to look good and feel comfortable as the weather starts warming up, you're in the right place. Before we get into it, I want to thank NOMOS Glasshuta for partnering with me on this video. I remember trying on a NOMOS watch for the first time a couple of years ago, and I was blown away by both the style and the engineering. There's something about this Bauhaus inspired kind of minimalist German design aesthetic. It's simple and refined, but it's also fun and colorful. NOMOS recently let me borrow one of their limited edition Tetra Neomatic watches. This collection was created to celebrate 175 years of watchmaking in Glasshuta. By the way, pardon my German pronunciation, I hope I'm saying that right. Available in blue, red, black, and off-white, these square dial, impossibly thin automatic watches, are a perfect blend of elegant and edgy. They're just 33 millimeters across, but the square shape means that they're going to wear larger than a 33 millimeter round dial watch on your wrist. I think the size works on pretty much any size wrist. For reference, my wrist is about six and a quarter inches around, but NOMOS does make the Tetra in smaller sizes if you do want something smaller. I like this watch because it's sort of bold. It's a conversation starter. My style in general is pretty subdued, kind of understated, and so I like using accessories to add a bit of pop or flair to my looks. This saturated blue, almost indigo square shape dial definitely does that. Paired with a shell, a cordovan strap, it has a dressy feel. It's great for summertime at the office or a business casual zoom call, but you put it on a steel bracelet, and this watch becomes a bit more casual and sporty. I'd wear it with any summer outfit, even short than a t-shirt. And did I mention that NOMOS somehow fit an automatic movement into a 7.3 millimeter tall case, complete with an exhibition case back? This really is an incredible little watch, especially if you like to stand out from the crowd. And I could do a whole video just about this watch right here. I'm a huge fan of NOMOS, and it's really exciting to partner with them on a video and to get to test drive this Tetra NOMADIC for a little while. You can get more information on the Tetra NOMADIC collection over at nomos-glashuta.com, or you can click the link down below in the description to get more info on this exact watch. Okay, let's talk about summer essentials. Essential number one is three to four pairs of shorts that you absolutely love wearing. Some guys wear pants all summer, and that's fine. But for me, I love wearing shorts. I think it's good to have a few go-to pairs of shorts, including chino shorts, linen shorts, especially if you live somewhere that gets really hot, performance shorts, and of course, swim trunks. Chino shorts are the summer wardrobe workhorse. Most chino shorts are going to have 2% elastane or spandex built-in, so they'll have a little bit of stretch, but these are basically just cotton, twill shorts with slant pockets and belt loops. Now, the best length for chino shorts is anywhere between 5 and 8 inches. It's going to depend a bit on your height and how long your legs are, but for me, 6 to 7 inches is the sweet spot. I like neutral colors that go with anything, gray, khaki, brown, or navy blue. And you can wear chino shorts with t-shirts, polos, button-up shirts, they're very versatile. You can wear them with pretty much any type of shoes, including sandals, sneakers, driving mocks, you know, espadrilles, even loafers. I'll link to some of my favorite chino shorts down below in the description. Now, performance shorts are basically the same as chino shorts. It's just that they're made with different fabric. This is usually synthetic fabric that has certain technical or performance attributes, like it can wick moisture or help regulate your temperature. Sometimes these dry off quickly, and usually they're pretty stretchy. These can look a bit more techy than standard chino shorts, so almost like golf shorts, and I usually don't wear them with button-up shirts. You know, I usually like to wear my performance shorts with like t-shirts or maybe performance polos. Basically, they're just kind of like the athleisure version of chino shorts. Next up, we have linen shorts. Now, linen shorts usually have a bit more room in the leg because linen is a breathable fabric, but it's not stretchy, so you don't want it to fit too close to your leg. Some linen shorts have pleats, which I like. It gives you a bit more freedom around the hips, and it's kind of a nice retro detail. I like wearing linen shorts with short sleeve button-up shirts, but they also look great with t-shirts, polos, popovers. If you go somewhere that gets really hot, linen shorts are a must. And finally, you need to go to a pair of swim trunks. Now, I've tested out a ton of different swim trunk options, everything from really cheap like $15 H&M trunks to, you know, $250 designer swim trunks. And I found that you often get what you pay for. So my current favorite swim trunks are from Vilbrecken. I actually have no idea if I'm saying that right. It's a French brand, and I could be butchering that pronunciation, but I love these swim trunks. They have a button waistband and an internal drawstring. They're short, they're fitted the way swim trunks should be, in my opinion. And yeah, these are really expensive for swimwear, but for me, I'd rather have one nice pair of trunks that I can wear for many years than buy a new fast fashion pair every season. Essential number two is no show socks. Now, some shoes like those that are fully leather lined can be worn without socks. For example, boat shoes, driving mocks, these are designed to be worn sockless. But I personally find it more comfortable to wear low for socks or invisible socks with most shoes. That way you still get that sockless look, your ankles can still breathe, but you have a barrier between your skin and the inside of the shoe. Also, non leather shoes like canvas shoes or any shoes that have a fabric lining, they're going to start to smell if you wear them with bare feet. Bottom line is you need some no show socks. Now the best no show socks have two qualities. Number one, they don't slip off your foot. And number two, they're actually invisible. So we're not talking about ankle socks here. I've tried on over 20 different pairs of no show socks from all the most popular brands. And I do have a couple of favorites, which I will link to down below in the description. Essential number three is slip on shoes. There's something about a low cut slip on shoe that's just perfect for summer. You know, these shoes were practically made to look good with shorts and linen pants. Now my style isn't as preppy as it used to be. So I don't really wear boat shoes or penny loafers very often. Instead, I've been wearing plain canvas or suede slip ons like this pair from greats and casual loafers like this pair from del Toro. These two styles are pretty much interchangeable. It just depends on how casual of a look I'm going for. You know, the suede or a canvas slip on like a plain white slip on is going to be pretty casual. It's kind of interchangeable with like a white leather sneaker. And then the loafer is just one step up in formality. So think smart casual. And of course, there are other styles you could wear driving mocks or espadrilles, but I think the white slip on is so versatile. I could wear this one pair of shoes all summer. Essential number four is light outerwear. I'm going to be real with you. There's really no way to layer up comfortably when it's really hot outside. And that's fine. You know, just enjoy the freedom of just wearing a shirt and no jacket, no sweater. But for those cool summer nights and mornings, you can definitely wear a bit of outerwear as long as it's very lightweight. My go to pieces right now are this nylon windbreaker from J crew. I got this like seven years ago. I don't think they make it anymore. So I can't give you a link or anything. And this one, the zipper is broken. It's like pretty beat up, but I don't know. I still wear it a lot. I love the color. I love the way it looks. I've also been wearing this linen and trucker jacket from Billy Reed. The tobacco color goes with everything. And even though the fabric actually has a bit of weight and drape to it, it's extremely breathable. So it's good for summer. And then you could also try wearing a noragi style jacket as a light outer layer. I actually think these look good with shorts too, which isn't true for most jackets. These are available in different materials, but if you get something like linen or even just a lightweight cotton, it's going to be breathable and it's going to work really well for warmer weather. Of course, I'll link to this one down below in the description. Essential number five is SPF moisturizer. Now we all know we should wear sunscreen pretty much every day if we're going to be outside. But let's be honest, when you use sunscreen on your face, it usually leaves your skin feeling kind of greasy and it can even cause clogged pores and acne. The answer is to use a face moisturizer with SPF built in. Now if you get a high quality SPF moisturizer, it's going to go on like a lightweight lotion. It's going to soak right in. It's not going to feel like sunscreen. It's not going to leave any residue behind. Two of my favorites are matte for men and Strix. Actually used matte for men after I took a shower just a little while ago and you can see there's no greasy residue on my skin. It just leaves a nice kind of soft mattifying effect. Strix does the same thing so it kind of helps reduce shine and protects your skin from the sun at the same time. High quality moisturizer with SPF isn't cheap but your skin is worth it. Essential number six is sunglasses. Now this one's really obvious so I almost didn't include it on the list but I wanted to mention sunglasses because I think that most guys, most people don't put enough thought into which sunglasses they buy. Sunglasses are just like jeans. If they don't fit you, they're not going to look good no matter how expensive they are. So the best sunglasses aren't necessarily the fanciest ones. They're the ones that really fit your face. I actually made a whole video about how to choose sunglasses that fit your face and it has nothing to do with trying to figure out your face shape. I personally think it's the best guide on choosing sunglasses on all of YouTube so definitely go check that out and after you watch that guide you'll be ready to buy your favorite pair of sunglasses ever. And essential number seven is wipes. So no matter how light and breezy your clothes are sometimes you're just going to sweat. This is true for every summer wedding I've ever been to. As a side note, why are we having weddings during the hottest part of the year outside? Who decided that this was the best time to get suited up and stand in a field all afternoon? You know, how about a nice fall wedding? Anyway, a lot of staying comfortable during summer weddings is really just managing the discomfort. It's managing the sweat. So if I'm going to be in one of these situations, I make sure to bring wipes. Specifically body wipes and face wipes. So body wipes are basically the next best thing to taking a shower when you can't take a shower. It takes like 30 seconds to use one and it actually goes a long way to helping you feel and smell a bit fresher. Face wipes are designed to remove oil from your skin. And these are especially crucial if you're going to be getting your picture taken, like if you're in a wedding. I always pack both of these in my Dopp kit and I can't tell you how many times I've been at a wedding and I'm the guy handing out these face wipes to all the groomsmen as they're getting their photos taken. And you can be that guy too. So stock up on some wipes. And that is my list of summer essentials. I want to thank Nomos again for supporting the channel by partnering with me on this video. Definitely go check out the Tetra Neomatic. It is such a cool watch and while you're there, check out the rest of Nomos' collection because they're doing some really incredible stuff. If you have any questions for me, leave them down below in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " You know, everybody wants to know like real numbers. And so in order to satisfy your audience, this is what I would say. I have been strength training with a professional coach for about six months at the time of recording at 125 pounds body weight. I am currently squatting 230 dead lifting 285 benching 150 and overhead pressing 115 pounds. These are all for reps. These aren't one rep max. I'm still very much a beginner, but I'm stronger than I ever thought I'd be to be honest. And I've made more progress in the past six months with a coach than I did in the previous 18 months lifting on my own. So in this video, I want to share some things that I've learned along the way. And hopefully it'll be useful if you've been thinking about getting into strength training, or maybe like me, you were training on your own for a while and not really making the gains that you wanted. I also want to answer some common beginner questions about lifting weights. And for that, I've enlisted the help of my coach, Mr. Matt Reynolds, founder of Barbell Logic. Matt has trained people like Brett McKay from the art of mailiness, Tanner Guzzi, who you might know from Instagram or here on YouTube. He's trained Thomas Frank and thousands of other men and women. And while this video is not sponsored by Matt or his company Barbell Logic, I will leave a link down below in the description that you can use to get one free month of training. So this is the exact coaching program that I'm enrolled in. There's no strings attached. You can get a free month of coaching using the link below in the description. So if you've been wanting to get stronger or maybe lose some weight or put on some muscle while you're watching this video, go click that link and just check out the program. Now you may not be sure if strength training is right for you. And to be honest, that's a fair question. So I actually asked coach Matt why people should lift weights. If you look at every sort of physical ability that you could have, strength being one of those, speed, muscular endurance, cardiovascular fitness, mobility, strength training is the only thing that makes all of them better in the beginning. If you're an untrained individual, if you squat full range of motion, your mobility gets better, right? If you squat heavy sets of five, as you know, and you've done, like your heart rate goes, I always do, I literally just got done working out just a little bit ago. My heart rate was 156 when I got done with my set of five of deadlift. And so strength training makes all of those things better, not to the nth degree, like you can't just strength training and go run a marathon. But if you just go do aerobic training, it will only train your aerobic capacity. It won't make you stronger. And if you only do yoga, you will get more mobile, but you will not get stronger. Strength always comes first, whether you're underweight and trying to gain weight, whether you're overweight and trying to lose weight, strength is first, and we start to add in those other things. Now, when we talk about strength training, what does that actually mean? Until recently, I never really understood the difference between weightlifting, strength training, powerlifting, and Olympic lifting. I'm going to let Matt explain the differences. Weightlifting and Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting are all actual strength sports, the competitive sports. Powerlifting is the squat, the bench press, the deadlift. Weightlifting is the snatch and the clean and jerk. Strength training is the foundational thing that sort of drives all of those sports, including strongman or even like arm wrestling. I could even say football, you know, throwing shot. Strength training is the generic term, like all weightlifting and powerlifting and strongman and is strength training, but not all strength training is weightlifting or powerlifting or strongman. So even though I won't be entering in any local strongman competitions anytime soon, it doesn't mean that my strength training isn't hard. It is very difficult and it's supposed to be hard. You know, certain lifts like the overhead press are just grindy. I mean, I fail on this thing all the time and it's important that I'm going to that point of failure because I'm doing something called progressive overload. If you're not sure what progressive overload or it's cousin that linear progression actually means, I'm going to let Matt clear things up. So progressive overload just means doing a little more each time and that could come from different variables. Like you could add a little more weight or you could add a few more reps, but it's a little more work each time. That's the idea. A little more stress, a little more work each time you go to the gym. That's progressive overload. So again, that's a very general term. Linear progression is one step to the right of that, which is I am progressing a single variable a little bit every time. So I'm going up five pounds per per lift every single week. That's linear progression or I'm going up one rep of extra volume every single week. That's linear progression via volume. So you could you could linear progress via volume or via intensity, which means weight on the bar. It's usually those two. If you're going to aim for strength training, then probably what you're going to do is you're going to progressively overload via a linear progression of strength increases or of weight increases on the bar. So you're going to go up two and a half pounds or five pounds on the bar every time. If you were going to be a bodybuilder, and I would say for people who want to get into hypertrophy and bodybuilding, they need to have a base of strength first. So I would still try to aim for strength. But if you're already pretty strong, what you might do is linear progress your volume because volume will lead to greater muscular gains or hypertrophy. And so you might increase that. So more than one way to do progressive overload. And it really just depends on what your goal is. So no matter what kind of program you're on, it has to get harder over time. If it doesn't, you're not going to get anywhere. You're not going to get stronger. Your muscles aren't going to get any bigger. So this means that those really tough days are good. Failure isn't necessarily bad. One weird thing I've noticed though is I never really know how I'm going to feel in the gym until I'm there actually lifting. Like sometimes I can get a great night's sleep. I'm hydrated. I'm caffeinated. And I'm doing my dead lifts and it feels like the weight is just bolted to the ground. Other days I go in with low expectations because I didn't sleep well. And I end up setting a new PR. So there is an element of randomness to it. And it's honestly as much of a mental game as it is a physical one. But over the long run, if you keep doing progressive overload, you will get stronger. Your muscles will get bigger. And that leads us to an important question. How strong do you need to be? You know, everybody wants to know like real numbers. And so in order to satisfy your audience, this is what I would say, you know, I think a double body weight squat is great. A body weight press, you know, a 1.5 x body weight bench press, and probably a 2.5 x body weight deadlift. Those are all pretty good places to be. But then there's also sort of like for the modest man who tends to be a smaller body weight guy, 150 pound guy, maybe, then I think that there are also some strength minimums like you should be able to squat 315. That's strong 315 for a smaller person is strong. A 365 to 405 deadlift is strong and completely doable. Right. Anybody on earth, no matter what your size, you could definitely press 150 bench press over 200 or 225 squat 300 deadlift 400. Anybody can do it. To put it in perspective, my wife has all done those numbers. If a 43 year old soccer mom can do this, anybody can do this. It just takes time and consistency. That's it. So as your strength training, you start closing in on these strength milestones and they can be the relative strength milestones or the strength minimums that Matt talked about. And I've always wondered like, what do you do when you hit those goals? What do you do after you get strong? I think it depends on the client. So I've had that conversation many times with my client, it just depends on what the client wants to do. A lot of times clients will hit those PRs and kind of hit those goals. I'm like, you know what, let's get a little stronger. Let's keep doing that. That's fine. They might say, Hey, I just want to maintain the strength that I have. And I want to do mud runs with my wife and our jobs as professional strength coaches is to make sure that we facilitate that for our clients. Now, occasionally you get a client who doesn't have a good handle on what is realistic. They'll be like, you know, I want to set world record powerlifting totals. And I want to be 5% body fat and I want to compete in bodybuilding and I want to do crossfit. And you're like, okay, we got it. We can't be jack of all trades. And so you got to choose or decide if you want to be just generally good at everything, you'll just be good at everything, but you'll be great at nothing. And that's okay. Right. So it just depends on the person. You know, for me, I definitely want to be strong. I want to hit these strength benchmarks, but I'm not really interested in competing or going too far beyond that. You know, I don't want to get huge. I mean, it's already hard enough for me to find clothes that fit. But I do think that strength training in some form will always be part of my long term fitness strategy. And I'm so glad that I finally got a coach. You know, I tend to try to do things by myself and just kind of figure things out. And that can work sometimes. But in this case, getting a professional coach was a game changer. Before getting a coach, I was program hopping like a total noob. I had plateaued on most of the big lifts. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if my technique was right. I wasn't even sure if I was doing everything safely. Just for fun, I asked coach Matt what kind of shape I was in when I first started with him. You know, your technique was not great. And your strength was, I don't know, moderate. And so as time has gone on, you know, when you started, you were squatting like 165 and now you're doing, you know, 230, somewhere that about 227 and a half, 230 for reps, you know, not for a single. You were pressing like 80 pounds, I think on your test workout, and you're pushing 115 now for on presses. So significant, you know, you're looking at a 30 to 40% increase over the last few months in your strength across the board. You know, your bench was like 115. Now it's pushing 160. And again, that's for reps. These aren't for singles. And your deadlift was around 215. And we had to tighten up your deadlift and teach you how to set your back and lift the flat back. So that took a little while to like learn how to really set your back and lift well. And you're like 285 now. So your 300 is like right around the corner for you on deadlift. So you've made really good progress. And then you've been really coachable along the way. So the combination of consistency while being coachable in your technique has led to really solid strength improvements. That's still a long way to go. I mean, you've still got a lot of growing to do, both in the strength and the hypertrophy piece. And again, we're not trying to turn you into a 220 pound power lifter. That's not, that's not the goal at all. The goal is just to get you strong power right here. That's right. That's right. The goal is, I love, I love that stuff, that fair life. Yeah, you know, I think the goal for you is to get as strong as you can. And it really your, your relative current size and maybe put on another, you know, five to six pounds of muscle while not really changing. I don't want you to go out and buy a new wardrobe. So you can wear the same clothes you've got, but they fit better. You've got more, a little more musculature, a little less fat, but you're, you're 75% stronger, which means you're practically so much more stronger. I think that's the key. So even though I have a long way to go, I've been really happy with my progress so far. And if you're curious about this program, I wanted to give Matt just a minute to explain why it might be a good fit for you. One of the nice things I think about block is that everybody can train for a month. Their first month is 100% free at block. And it's like, what's the catch? There's no catch. We, if it's our job to keep you as a client, if we can't keep you after that first month for free, then we didn't do our job. And so everybody can try it for free for your first month. The difference about Barbell Logic online coaching or block is that you are going to be assigned a professional coach that's your personal coach, and they are going to program for you personally, which includes all of the crazy life stuff that you have. And so those free programs online, or even if you pay for a template, 50 bucks for a program, it doesn't take into account, you know, your kid was up all night sick and kept you up, you go on vacation for a week. What do you do if you have a template? Like now you're behind. So one is the programming is truly personal. It's not, we don't use templates at all. And then two, the main thing is that our coaches are the best of the best coaches in the world. I mean, they're the most sought after, certified, educated, professional Barbell coaches on the planet, and they will break down your video every single day. And so technique, I would argue that technique is far more important than the program itself. I know you know this, when you hit record on your phone, you're like, okay, like Matt, Coach Reynolds is going to see this. And it kind of like raises the level of I need to perform well. I have to upload it to him. If I don't upload it to him, I'm going to get a message back the next day being like, Hey Brock, like everything okay? Like I saw you missed your workout. And so that accountability is huge. That leads to consistency. And then, oh, by the way, the programming is awesome because it's all personalized. So we don't just take cookie cutter programs and give it. So that's why I think block is such a such a success and is so effective for clients, which is really what we're looking for. Personally, I can say that if I did not get a coach, if I didn't have some accountability to actually get to the gym and get through these workouts, I probably would have given up by now, you know, especially as life has gotten a lot busier with a little baby at home. I've made more progress in the past six months with Barbell Logic online coaching than I did in the previous 18 months, lifting on my own and just finding random programs on the internet. I also feel confident that I'm training effectively and safely and I'm not just wasting my time. And I've gotten a couple small gains and it feels pretty good. It feels good to be a little stronger. It feels good to fill out my clothes a little more. So if you're interested in doing the same thing, again, click that link down below in the description and consider doing a one month free trial of this coaching program. No strings attached. If you don't like it, you can just stop and you'll probably learn a lot in that one month. If you have any questions for me, let me know down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Huckberry is one of the most unique online shops you're gonna come across. It almost feels more like a men's lifestyle magazine than an e-commerce shop. Really Huckberry is a multi-brand retailer that sells primarily online and they've been doing content marketing in a really genuine way for a long time since before it was really popular. Now originally Huckberry was a curator of brands mostly for men so they would sell other brands, menswear and apparel and footwear, some grooming supplies. They ended up getting into like EDC home goods and it's a great place to buy gifts not only for men but also for women. They also have a big community I think over a million people sort of like follow Huckberry on various platforms and they have their own collection of in-house brands. Now I've always admired Huckberry. I appreciate their aesthetic and their marketing and I've heard good things about their quality but up until recently I haven't actually tested any of their products. A couple of months ago Huckberry reached out they offered to send a care package with some of their most popular items from their in-house brands. So in this video I'll try everything on and share my thoughts and of course I'm going to link to everything you see down below in the description. By the way those are affiliate links so if you click those links and buy something it helps this channel earn a small commission just a few dollars per purchase usually and it doesn't cost you anything extra. I like this model of using affiliate links because it lets me talk about a brand without much bias but it only works if you go down to the description and click on those links it's a good way to let Huckberry know and other brands that videos like this work and they actually get some traffic and some interest in their brand. Okay so let's get into the haul. Like I mentioned I am trying Huckberry's in-house brands. I'm not going to try brands that they carry like Taylor Stitch and Louis Lemmon or Patagonia because you know all about them. So the brand I'm going to be showing you are Graze, Proof, 45, Flint and Tender and Whiskey Peaks. So let's take a look at each brand. Let's start with Graze. Now Graze makes wool footwear specifically indoor outdoor slippers. I don't wear shoes inside so I love a good pair of house shoes and the outdoor slipper from Graze definitely checks all the boxes. In fact I'm wearing them right now. I ordered my normal dress shoe size and I prefer a snug fit and slippers because I usually wear them without socks and these have plenty of room. In fact I could definitely wear them with thick wool socks. So if you're in between sizes I would say size down with Graze. The gray wool blend upper is structured and sturdy but it's also comfortable. It doesn't feel scratchy on your skin. The outsole is recycled rubber. It's very grippy. You could definitely walk outside with these. You know for me that's going to be like a trip to the mailbox or taking the trash out because I don't really want to wear my house shoes outside. These are not cheap. There are much more affordable slippers you can find out there but I expect these to last a while. So if you're in the market for some premium slippers especially indoor outdoor slippers I think you should check these out. Next up we have the brand Proof. So Proof is kind of like Huckberry's athleisure brand or performance brand. I think it's sort of like their answer to Lululemon or Outlier or Ministry of Supply but it is strictly casual clothing. The first item I tried from Proof is their 72 hour Merino tee. Now at the time of writing this t-shirt has 4.5 stars and over 450 reviews and I'm a fan of wool t-shirts. I've tried wool t-shirts from other higher-end brands like Outlier. I love the material. Wool is superior to cotton in almost every way but you do have to pay a premium for this. My problem with most wool t-shirts is that they're usually too long. So I was curious to see how an extra small fit on my five six 125 pound build and I was pleasantly surprised especially after a wash dry cycle. It fits really well. The length is just fine and the overall cut is flattering. It's somewhat fitted and I think it makes my you know chest and shoulders and arms look pretty good but it's not tight or restrictive and part of that is because it's a very kind of fine stretching material. The best part about a Merino wool t-shirt is they're so durable. Like they it handles moisture and odor and stains really well. So like if you're going on a trip and you want to pack lightly a Merino t-shirt is the way to go. Sticking with Proof I also tried the Rover pant. This is another Huckberry bestseller. These pants are made from a stretch canvas so it's 73% cotton 25% sorbetek and it's available in slim or straight cuts. I tried the slim fit in 2930. In retrospect I definitely could have sized down to a 28 waist so I think these pants run a little bit large compared to some other brands. The thing is I always used to wear 28 but since I've been spending a little more time in the gym 28s are usually too snug around the hips and in the seat for me. But these pants with the 29 waist have plenty of room. In fact I'd probably have to get the waist taken in just a little bit. They're also not super tapered even though this is the slim fit. To me these are more like a straight cut or maybe like a slim straight cut. I do like the material a lot. I like the light brown color. I like the style of them so I'll probably just get them tailored. Bottom line I think that the Rover pant is a nice kind of modern take on a durable work pant. I could see getting a lot of wear out of these but they do run a little bit bigger. And finally from Proof I tried the 7 inch Nomad short in the tarmac colorway. So compared to the Rover pant these shorts are very much like a performance short or like a tech short. They are made from 100% synthetic material. It's a polyester stretch twill. It's kind of like a medium heavyweight stretchy fabric that's water resistant but it's still pretty soft. It's not like super shiny or swishy but it doesn't look like chino. These are not your standard cotton chino shorts. They also have this matte black hardware in a hidden zip pocket so that kind of adds to the tech performance aesthetic. They fit a lot like the Rover pants so the 29 waist is a little bit large on me. If I order it again I would definitely size down to a 28. And these remind me a lot of Lululemon's commission shorts. Of course these are a shorter version of Lululemon's best-selling commission pant. The fit is almost exactly the same between Proof and Lululemon and I actually wish both brands made just slightly slimmer shorts. I prefer my shorts to be a little slimmer. The length is perfect and the fit is good enough so I'll definitely wear these but I have skinny legs and so I guess this is just incentive to hit leg day a little bit harder. The next brand I tried from Huckberry is called 45. I tried one item from this brand. It's their Slub Pocket Tee in extra small. The color is shoreline green. Now 45 specializes in t-shirts. They have Slub, Supima Cotton, Curved Ham, Long Sleeve Styles, V-Nex. I tried the Slub Pocket Tee. I think the color is really nice. The Slub Cotton feels very soft and broken in. I like the texture. The shirt does run a little bit large and a little bit boxy for an extra small compared to a lot of other brands that I've tried. Keep in mind I'm a smaller guy. I have a smaller than average frame so if you're more of an average guy in terms of weight then this shirt will probably fit you great. For me even after a wash and a dry on high heat it's just a little bit longer and a little bit looser than I like my t-shirts to fit. It's too bad because I like the style and the look of this t-shirt and the feel but compared to the proof shirt this one is just a little roomy. Next up I tried Flint and Tender. So this is Huckberry's most popular brand by a long shot. This is kind of like J Crew but maybe a little more outdoorsy and rugged. It's as if Bonobos and LL Bean had a little menswear baby. I really wanted to try the Flint and Tender waxed trucker jacket. I think that's actually Huckberry's most popular product but they were out of stock when I put in my order so I'll have to try that sometime later. I did try these 365 shorts though and these are more like your basic Gino shorts. They do have a little bit of stretch built in 2% spandex but they feel like Gino shorts. I went with the 7 inch inseam in the earth color which is sort of a tobacco brown and again I went with the 29 waist because most 28's are too tight for me these days and again in this case the 29 has a little too much room. In this case I would just wear a belt. I don't think I would get these tailored and the overall fit is slim but nowhere near skinny so it's kind of like the other shorts. I think this is a very flattering cut for the vast majority of guys for my thin legs. They have a little bit of extra room but it's definitely not a deal breaker. If I was really picky I might get these tapered just a tiny bit at the tailor or I might just use some more squats. I do like that the rise is a bit higher on these compared to brands like bonobos. All in all I would definitely recommend these as comfy, durable Gino shorts that are available in a bunch of staple colors and a pretty good variety of sizes. Also from Flint and Tinder I tried their Heritage boxer briefs size small in the heathered gray color. Now let me preface this by saying I am an underwear snob. I've reviewed many of the most popular men's underwear brands and in my opinion the best underwear is often from brands that are focused solely on that category. I'm talking about brands like Tommy John and Mack Weldon and Exofficio and Tanny and even Haynes and like a pair of thieves. Even Lululemon makes great underwear. So when I try on just like a pair of stretch cotton boxer briefs from a brand that really doesn't focus on underwear specifically I don't have high expectations and I would say that these underwear don't exceed my expectations. For the price almost $30 a pair you can get better boxer briefs from some of the brands that I just mentioned. I'd argue that you could even get better boxer briefs from more affordable brands like Haynes and Calvin Klein and Fruit of the Loom. Also these run kind of small like on me the size small which is my normal size in underwear is pretty tight around the hips and in the seat. I'd probably have to size up to a medium but then that would be too loose around the waist. So at least at this time I can't really recommend Flint and Tender underwear. And finally I tried Huckberry's Whiskey Peaks brand. So Huckberry sells a lot of stuff in like the home goods and EDC and home decor categories and I wanted to try something from those categories and they told me that these whiskey peek whiskey glasses were one of their best sellers. Now I don't drink that much these days but when I do I like to sip on a good bourbon usually with one or two cubes of ice. And to do that properly you need the right rocks class. So these are hand blown glasses and they each feature a different topographic impression from various mountain ranges around the world. Since I've spent some time in the southwest I chose the Grand Canyon glasses. They're very cool looking they're definitely a conversation starter if you pour someone a drink in this kind of glass and they're going to comment on it. Also I really like the size they're a bit smaller it's a six ounce glass and I just like the size it fits in my hand nicely. One thing I don't like about these is the weight. I noticed that some of the reviews for this on Huckberry's website people mentioned that these glasses felt a bit light and I kind of agree they just feel a little bit light for like a high quality premium whiskey glass. If you're someone that likes a bit of thickness and half-to-tier rocks glass these probably aren't for you but if you don't really care about that they're pretty cool and these would make a great gift for anybody in your life who enjoys the outdoors or nature or hiking and whiskey. And that's it for today's haul. Again I will link to all this stuff down below in the description. Please check that out. Please use those links that help support the channel and it lets brands like Huckberry know that these videos actually drive some traffic and that way I can do more videos like this and review more brands for you. If you have any questions about what you saw in this video or if you have any requests for brands that I should check out leave them down below in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time stay stylish."

        "transcript": " Well, it's been over one year since my last EDC video and I've made a couple of changes, a couple of upgrades perhaps, and we're gonna get into all of that right after the break. I want to thank Deweyr for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. What I love about Deweyr is the fact that they make performance clothing. I'm talking about fabrics that are five times stretchier than traditional denim or cotton, but it doesn't look like performance clothing. You know some tech pants make that swishy sound when you walk around? Deweyr pants don't do that. Their fabrics are breathable, they'll adapt to different temperatures, they're lightweight and soft, and some of them are made from sustainable materials like wood chips and recycled plastic bottles. But they still look like normal casual clothing, like they don't look like hiking pants or gym shorts. Right now as it's heating up outside, I'm loving Deweyr's Live Light Journey shorts. These just look like regular Chino shorts, but they're much more comfortable and stretchy, and the Coolmax fibers help them handle heat way better than traditional cotton. They also have a smart storage pocket and a key ring, which is perfect for my EDC setup. I love that I can clip in my carabiner to the key ring and then let it hang in my pocket so it doesn't jingle around as I walk. I also love Deweyr's Take on the basic t-shirt. They call this the only tee, and it's super soft and lightweight. It's cut like a modern fit, so it's slim but not tight. I think it's a really flattering fit, but it's not restrictive. And the DuraSoft fabric is strong, it's soft, and it's perfect for warm weather. I actually think this is probably the most comfortable tee shirt in my closet right now. So if you care about comfort, but you don't want to sacrifice style or durability, I think you're going to like Deweyr. Click the link down below in the description and use the code MODESTMAN for 15% off everything. One more time, link down below and use the promo code MODESTMAN for 15% off your Deweyr order. Okay, let's get into my everyday carry, starting with probably the most important item, my phone. I upgraded from a busted up iPhone SE2 to this green iPhone 13 mini. I've always had either black or white phones, and I have to say, this green color is kind of a nice change of scenery. I almost don't want to cover it up, and to be honest, I've never used a case on my phone in the past, but my last two phones, I have dropped and cracked the screen. So I decided to get a case for this one. This brown leather case is from Nomad Goods. It has drop protection up to 10 feet. It's not too bulky, and it's made from Horween leather from Chicago. So it's going to age gracefully and develop that nice patina over time. It does cover up that nice forest green color, but the brown and green look good together and, you know, safety first. The phone is incredible. Huge upgrade from the SE2. Just the camera alone is worth the price of admission, in my opinion. The cinematic video mode is really incredible. I mean, it's almost rivaling like entry level, mirrorless or DSLR cameras. And of course, I like the size of the mini much better than the regular iPhone or the iPhone Pro, in my opinion. Speaking of changes, I am carrying a new wallet. This card wallet is from a brand called Harbor London. Prior to this, I've carried Anson Calder wallets, usually their cash wallet, or their card wallet with a cash slot. Still love that wallet. I've carried it for many years, and I still think it's one of the best on the market. You can go check out my other older EDC videos if you want to see that wallet. But I'm always trying new options just to see what's out there. And this one from Harbor London is pretty nice. It's not a groundbreaking format or anything like that, but it's just a nice execution on a tried and true card holder format. It's super low profile and thin, but it's very strong. I've been using it for a while now, and it's not coming apart or loosening up or losing its shape. I carry three cards on either side, and then a few bills and some extras in the middle. I keep stuff in the middle that I don't use very often, like if I need to hold on to a receipt for a couple weeks, like from the tailor or my insurance cards and things like that. I also really like the lighter brown color. I like the pebbled texture of the leather. I don't know, just add some color and some visual interest to my EDC. Next up, we have my keys. Now I've tried all different kinds of key organizers and carriers and carabiners. In fact, I have a whole video about the best key organizer, so you can go check that out if you want more details. But I keep coming back to the carabiner. And specifically, I've been using this carabiner from Wesson. It's a super simple design, just one piece, no moving parts or breakable parts. It just uses tension to open and then stay closed. It's also a good size, not too big, not too small. I've never had a problem with this carabiner coming off of my belt loop or with keys sliding off. Now the one big drawback of a carabiner in general is that you can't clip it onto your pants if you're wearing pants that don't have belt loops. In that case, I just put the whole thing in my pocket, which is kind of bulky. But it works perfectly with any pants or shorts that do have belt loops, especially if they're reinforced. And it works even better if your pants or shorts come with a key clip, like these ones from Dure. On the carabiner, I have two key rings or sets that can be removed separately. One has a small knife, the Spyderco bug, and a key to my bike lock. And then the other one has the fob for my car and my house key. So this lets me quickly customize my key setup without messing with actual little key rings. For example, I can remove my knife and bike lock if I'm going to go fly somewhere because I don't need those things and I can't bring the knife through security. Or I can quickly give my house and car key to somebody if they're like getting my mail or watching my things while I'm out of town. I'm also testing out this Wesson multi-tool. I like the idea of carrying a multi-tool and every now and then I find myself in need of like a bottle opener or a screwdriver. But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll use any sort of multi-tool enough to justify carrying one all the time. Either way, this is the most minimal and functional key setup I've had in a long time and I'm really happy with it. Next up, my trusty AirPods Pro are still a crucial part of my everyday carry. I use these all the time. I really think they're the best product Apple has come out with in many years. My only gripe with these is that I can't wear them if I go running. So I can wear them when I'm like lifting, but if I'm running, like for some reason that motion just makes them fall out of my ears. The only solution I found is to use these little rubber wings. They're pretty cheap. I got them off Amazon and I'll link to them down below in the description. So I just attach these when I'm going to go for a run and then the AirPods stay in my ears just fine. Of course, you can't charge your AirPods with these little wings on there. So you have to take them off to put them back in the charging case, which is kind of a pain. So I basically just put them on when I'm going to use them. But still, that's a minor complaint. I also started using a leather skin for my AirPods Pro case. To be honest, I don't think this is necessary. I like the low profile case that Apple has designed, but you know, the added drop protection is kind of nice. I think it's worth it for the extra bulk. And I do like this leather case from Nomad Goods. Again, it's made from that Horween leather and it's going to develop a really nice patina over time. Moving on, I know that masks aren't required in many places right now, but this can change. And I usually just carry one just to make sure that I'm respecting the rules of any business or household that still requires a mask. The best mask I've found and I've tried a lot of them is from Adams. Adams actually makes shoes like they make this really comfortable sneaker. That's their flagship product, but they started selling these masks and I find them to be extremely comfortable. They also handle moisture and odor really well. And I think they actually look pretty good too. I do wish they didn't really have a logo or had a smaller logo. Not a huge fan of visible logos, especially on face masks. Okay, I'm not really sure if rings are considered part of your everyday carry, but I do carry them every day. So I'm going to include them here. During the day, I wear my four millimeter platinum slightly curved wedding band. I really only take it off when I'm working out or at night. And at night, I wear the Aura ring. Now, in my opinion, these Aura rings, they're cool. Like it's a cool piece of tech, but they're just too bulky to wear all the time. I hope that one day they'll make a lower profile version of the Aura ring. But I do like tracking my sleep. And so I put the Aura ring on at night just for sleep tracking. It'd be really cool if one day these were just shrunk down. So it was basically just like a little silicone ring, but it still had all those tracking capabilities. Next up, we have my sunglasses. So I wear sunglasses pretty much every time I leave the house, except for at night. I've owned a few pairs of nicer higher end sunglasses, even some prescription sunglasses. But my last pair broke. And so right now I'm just wearing these cheap sunglasses from some online shop that I don't think is around anymore. They cost like $15. So they're nothing special, but they happen to fit my face really well. And they stay on my face. And just like with clothing, I think with sunglasses, I would rather have a cheap pair that fits really well versus an expensive pair that's too big for me. I do want a higher quality pair of sunglasses and maybe even a prescription pair. So if you have any suggestions or brands that I should check out, leave them down below in the comments section. And finally, let's talk watches. I've test driven many watches over the last year or so, but I keep coming back to the same one. And that's the Rolex Explorer 114 270. I did a whole video about buying and unboxing this watch. So you should definitely go check that out if you like watches. This particular Explorer was produced in 2007. So I guess you could call it the old 36 millimeter Explorer because Rolex recently brought it back. But if you compare this to like a vintage Explorer or even the 14270, this is still a modern Rolex. I love the size of this watch. I think it makes a lot more sense than the 39 millimeter Explorer. I'm really glad that Rolex brought back 36 millimeter size. I also just love the weight and the color and the simple design of this watch. It truly could be a one watch collection. It goes with pretty much any outfit I wear short of maybe like black tie. But these days, you could definitely wear this watch with a suit too. I'd be happy if I could only wear a Rolex Explorer in 36 millimeters for the rest of my life. But if I had to choose one watch from my collection, it would be the day just. That's a topic for another video though. I hope you enjoyed this EDC update. I'll link to everything that you saw here if it's in stock down below in the description, along with any active discount codes. If you have any questions about my gear or anything else, leave them down in the comment section below. Thank you one more time to Deweyr for supporting the channel and sponsoring this video. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " All right, the last Q&A video I did on this channel was three years ago when the channel hit 150,000 subscribers. I meant to do another one at 300,000, but I didn't. So it's about time for an update. I asked you guys to submit questions here on YouTube and over on Instagram. And if you're not following me, you can follow at Brock McGough. Got a bunch of great questions to keep things organized. I divided these into four different categories. We'll talk about style and grooming, watches, business and career stuff, and then personal fitness stuff. Timestamps below, feel free to jump to whichever section you're interested in. Feel free to skip around. I won't be offended. This video will be a bit longer and more casual than most of my videos. And if you are one of my subscribers, if you've been following for a while, I just want to say thank you. Okay, so let's just get into it. First question, what is your height in shoes? I am just over five, six in shoes barefoot. I'm about five, five and change. I get this question all the time and it's weird because I feel like I'm always stating my height. It's in my Instagram bio. It's in the YouTube description. It's always in every video that I make, but I still get this question all the time. So yeah, five, six and shoes. What are your thoughts on the recent baggy style making a comeback versus the old slim fitted style? Listen, I don't really care what other people wear, but personally, I don't really like the oversized look for myself. It can be cool. And I think there are a lot of guys here on YouTube that are pulling it off really well, but I just don't like it. You know, I don't want to buy new clothes every few years. And so I don't really follow trends. I also like when my clothes enhance my physique. And so I tend to wear more fitted clothing. That said, I have gotten rid of some of my most skinny fit clothing. Like I had a couple pairs of jeans that were just really skinny fit. And I've gotten some recent very small gains in the gym and they're just too skinny now. But anyway, I'm going to make a whole video about my thoughts on the oversized trend and why I still wear slim fit clothes in the future. What's your view on sandals like Birkenstocks for the summer? I love them. I think they're really comfortable and they're great for walking long distances. Birkenstocks in particular, they have a really firm footbed. So it's good for anybody with foot pain or joint pain. But you know, Birkenstocks, Tivas, Chakos, they're very casual. So of course they have their limits in terms of wearing them with socks. Well, it's a look and your mileage may vary. What is your favorite perfume? Lately, I've been wearing a fragrance called Silver Lake by Bentley. It's honestly, it's a bit more spicy than most of the clones that I tend to wear, which are more clean and fresh. But I don't know, I've really been liking it. It's kind of addictive. All right, this is a two for one. What are your favorite brands lately? And Hey Brock out of all the menswear brands, which ones do you prefer in terms of quality and price? So all of my outfits consist of at least two or three brands. So I really couldn't just pick one brand. But some brands that I've been enjoying lately, and that I think offer a lot of bang for your buck include Suitsupply for formal wear, Everlane for chinos, jeans and some tops, Uniquelo for t-shirts, there's Epimacot and t-shirts are still some of the best value in the game, Banana Republic for outerwear, if you can find it on sale, Patagonia also for casual outerwear, Lulu Lemon and 10,000 for activewear and athleisure. I like smart wool for socks, Beckett's Simonin for shoes, if you're looking for great value. And of course, Seiko watches. At what price point do you hit diminishing returns in quality with different clothing items? All right, these are very rough. But here are some price points that I think above which you're just paying for the label t-shirts, I think about $30 for a cotton t-shirt $60 for a wool jeans $150 to $200, dress shoes anything over $400 diminishing returns, sneakers anything over $200 and suits anything over $1500 you're probably going to see some diminishing returns. Outerwear, it varies widely but really anything over like $1000 you're probably just paying for either extreme cold weather gear or a designer label. As a portly wheelchair user, what's my best option for getting clothes that fit? I would give you the same advice that I give to anybody, if you're going to need to visit a tailor, you know, fit is the most important aspect of style. Now obviously for you, you got to focus on functional reform. Really, that's true for everybody. You're probably going to want to focus especially on your shirts for pants. They can probably be a little longer since you'll be sitting down. So you don't want them to ride up too high and shoes are going to be crucial. People are going to notice your shoes. I mean, everybody notices everybody's shoes, but for you especially, people are going to look at your shoes. So focus on fit and color just like everybody else. Focus on great footwear. What do you think will be the biggest change in fashion over the next decade? I think that fast fashion is going to get even faster. Trends are going to come and go so quickly that nothing will ever be definitively cool or uncool. In fact, the only thing that will be uncool is the thing that was just cool, hence the current depth of skinny jeans. I think in the near term future, maximalism like loud colors, big logos, big patterns and prints, that's going to sort of replace the minimalist style aesthetic. And unfortunately, we're probably going to see low rise flared leg jeans make a come back because everything in fashion is cyclical. What are your thoughts about dressing sharp and formal in the summer? Like for a wedding, what are my options in the scorching heat? I'm going to give you some advice you've probably heard a million times, wear lighter colors, breathable fabrics like linen and if you can go sockless. Truth is, if you go to a summer wedding, you're probably going to be hot. You're probably going to sweat. So a lot of it is just managing the heat and the discomfort. So for comfort, you can wear an undershirt to help soak up that sweat. You can bring a body and face wipes to freshen up throughout the day, wear sunglasses so you're not squinting and of course use an SPF moisturizer on your face. Okay, Peter P asks, do you know of any resources for fashion for bigger or chubby guys? I love your videos, but a lot of the time it's hard to implement because I'm chubby. Okay, first of all, the advice that I'm giving you in my videos applies to anybody, any body or shape or skin tone, any weight or height. It's the same principles. Your clothes have to fit well, you know, gently fitted clothes will enhance any physique. That said, there's one Instagram account that I really recommend for bigger guys. It's called coastal flicks. The guy's name is Nick Ortega. He's a photographer, used to live in New York, now lives in LA and I've worked with him a few times, really cool guy and he's a bigger guy and he has great style advice for bigger guys. As a teenager with little money, how should I build my wardrobe and where should I buy clothes from? First of all, get used to thrifting. So go to Buffalo Exchange, go to Goodwill, get comfortable with buying used clothes online from places like eBay and Grail. This involves knowing your measurements and taking a little bit of risk because they don't have free returns. Be intentional. Don't just buy stuff because it's trendier on sale. Don't worry too much about keeping up with trends. You know, be yourself. You're going to get more bang for your buck if you buy stuff that you can wear for a few years. Focus on the highest quality you can afford. Don't go into credit card debt for clothing, but if you're going to buy a t-shirt, it's better to buy a $15 or $20 t-shirt that's going to last a few years than a $5 t-shirt that's going to fall apart. In terms of brands, I think that Uniclo is one of the best brands for affordable basics. Hey, I'm quite new to the channel, but I have one question. Your face skin looks flawless. Could you share your daily skincare routine or maybe recommend some brands? Hopefully international ones as I'm watching from Poland. Well, thank you. Part of it is just good lighting. I have many problems with my skin just like everybody else or most other people. I get acne. I have dark circles under my eyes when I don't get enough sleep, but I do have a routine and I'm always trying out new brands, but at the very least, I wash my face daily. I use a moisturizer, especially with SPF when it's sunny outside, and then I use some sort of anti-aging cream at night. The one ingredient that made a big difference for me is a Dappalene gel. The brand for this is called Differin, but really any sort of topical retinoid like retinol cream will make a big difference if you haven't tried it. So if other acne fighting ingredients like salicylic acid or benzyl peroxide don't work for you, I highly recommend trying retinol. Have you considered growing a beard? I heard monoxydyl really works. So I have thought about using that. I've thought about even like making a video about that process. The thing is, I'm not sure the side effects are worth it. It's a pretty serious chemical and I don't know if I want a beard that bad. So maybe one day, but no immediate plans. What has been your biggest style mistake? Biggest mistake by far, I never used to focus on fit. For me, a big light bulb moment was discovering that fit is the most important aspect of style and that I should probably start getting my clothes tailored. More recently, I think a mistake that I made is going a little bit too skinny with my jeans. Honestly, when the skinny fit trend came along, I was so happy just to find clothes finally that fit my kind of slender build that I went all in on the skinny fit trend. And the clothes still work for my build. I still wear a lot of skinny or slim fit clothes, but I definitely went a little too skinny on a couple of occasions. White, black or gray t-shirts, if you had to choose one for the rest of your life, gray. Okay, now let's talk watches. What's on the wrist? So right now I'm wearing this vintage Datejust 1603O. Got this from Theo and Harris a few years ago and it's definitely my favorite watch. Would you consider T-Sew as an investment for those beginning in watch collecting? No. So I would never buy any watches as an investment, but if you really want to, you need to look at brands that historically go up in value and T-Sew is not one of those brands. You know, you really have to look at Rolex. Now, sometimes there are other non-luxury brands that will increase in value depending on the model. For example, if a specific Seiko is discontinued, it might go up in value a bit. But if you want to spend a few thousand dollars on a watch and, you know, have it be an investment, you really got to pick carefully and T-Sew would not fit that criteria. What's a good entry level diver and or GMT? There are so many good choices that could make a whole channel just about that topic, but it sort of depends what you mean by affordable. So for divers, I would look at the Seiko SKX or Turtle, really any Orient diver like the Mako or the Rey. For GMTs, you could look at the Mido. Is it Mido or Mido? I'm going to say Mido, Ocean Star GMT, Timex Waterberry GMT, the Laurier Hyperion. If you want to check out a micro brand, you could also check out Glycine, Squall and Steinhardt. But yeah, tongue to choose from, just Google it. Watch that can go with anything. I think a stainless steel watch with a solid black dial, either time only or with a date window, can go with any outfit, assuming it's the right size for your wrist. For example, the Seiko SNE 039, the Tiso PRX, the Tiso Gentleman, the Laurier Falcon, the Seiko SARB 033 and of course, the Rolex Explorer. I could go on, but I think that this type of watch, it's a simple neutral color dial steel bracelet, goes with anything from casual to formal. And of course, a leather strap would be just as versatile. And if you wanted a blue or white dial, that would work just as well. Okay, let's get into personal and fitness questions. As a similar weight and height to yourself, I'd love to know your diet and calorie intake with working out. Keep up the great work. Thank you, sir. So I haven't tracked my calories in a while, but I'm probably at 1900 to 2200 calories a day. My wife is vegetarian, so I mostly eat plant-based meals at home. I supplement this with protein shakes, but I'm not going to lie, I struggle to get enough protein throughout the day, especially if I'm trying to hit like 100 to 150 grams. Even just eating at like a 200 calorie surplus, I just feel very full, very easily. So it's always been a bit of a struggle. That said, I have gained a few pounds and seen pretty significant strength gains and some aesthetic gains in the past few months. I've been lifting pretty heavy three to four times a week. So yeah, doing that, it is a little easier to eat more, but I really haven't tracked anything with like my fitness pal in a long time. What are your personal workout goals? So really, I just want a sustainable, long-term exercise habit that helps me stay strong and get more flexible as I get older. I really want to enjoy my fitness routine. If I don't enjoy it, then I'm not going to do it. Since I've been focused on strength training for a while now, specifically, my goals are to hit a 250 pound squat, a 315 deadlift, 165 bench, and 125 pound overhead press. I think those are all realistic in the next, I don't know, year or so. And of course, I want to look good without a shirt on. I think a little bit of vanity is just fine and it can go a long way to keep you motivated. All right, Caesar says, Hey Brock, been a subscriber for some time. I really enjoy your content. Thank you. I've heard you mentioned your wife, how many years have you been married? Do you have any kids? Why did you move from New York? And a similar question, love the vid, keep it coming. Where do you live now? Still married? Are you still doing the blog? How two series you had? And what do you see as profitable topics to blog about for men in 2022? Thanks both. I am married. I've been married for four years now. We have a little girl who is just over six months at the time of recording. So I moved to New York City right before the pandemic hit. It wasn't great timing. My wife and I thought about staying there and maybe moving to Brooklyn or something. But I love the people and the energy and the vibe of New York and the spontaneity, but we both prefer a slightly quieter and more relaxed life. And especially given the timing of when we were in New York, it just didn't make sense for us to stay. I will say that that city lives up to the hype. I'm so glad I got to live there for a year. And I have relationships from that time there that will last a lifetime. After New York, we moved down to Richmond, Virginia. I grew up outside of DC. So I'm kind of familiar with this area. I have family down here. And then we're actually moving back out West pretty soon here in terms of the blog how to series. Yes, I still blog about blogging at fulltimeblog.com. You can see my income reports and all kinds of stuff there, kind of like a behind the scenes look at what I do for my business profitable topics to blog about in 2022, anything really any topic, no matter how niche it is, we'll have some interest. And if you create good content about a topic, no matter what the topic is, you will attract an audience over time. Okay, how's daddyhood? I am loving it so far. It's exhausting as anyone who has kids knows, but it's extremely rewarding. It makes me really thankful that I have a flexible job to be honest, even just with one kid and with my wife and I basically both having flexible jobs. It's still really hard. I have no idea how single parents do this, or like a single mom with like a regular wage job with no time off. I have no idea how those people do it. And this has made me much more empathetic for people like that. How have your style choices changed if at all since becoming a dad? Well, everything gets spit up on it. You don't really have time to shower. You don't have as much time to think about your outfits. And you're going to get other stuff on your clothes too. You know, I didn't really stop wearing anything when I became a dad. Like I didn't say, okay, these clothes are too nice to wear. I kind of battle tested stuff. And so like when my daughter was really little and was like spitting up a lot, I would still wear my wool or cashmere sweaters and just see how they handled it. And I was surprised, like most of my clothes can hold up to some abuse, especially like the kind of athleisure performance fabrics and then the wool fabrics held up really well. Ryan asks, do you have any pets? We used to have a little dog named Clover, but we had to say goodbye to her. I don't know, maybe three and a half, four years ago now, maybe longer than that. But yeah, she was very cute, kind of neurotic. And we loved her. I don't know if we'll get another dog in the future. Now that we have a baby, we probably will, but not for a while. All right, I love the content and got a few for you. What are some of your guilty pleasures in fashion and in life in general? What are some of your hottest takes most unpopular opinions in men's fashion? What is your favorite cryptid creature? Why am I still single? Please don't answer that. And a risk check. Okay, fashion. I am a total sock and underwear snob. And at home, I will definitely wear socks with my Tivas or Birkenstocks around the house. A guilty pleasure in life. I eat a lot of dessert. Okay, hot takes in fashion. Belts are overrated. Minimalist sneakers are better than boots or loafers. And black is the most overrated color in fashion. It's not nearly as versatile as people think. Same goes for white. Favorite cryptid creature? Call me basic, but I'm a fan of the Loch Ness Monster. Why am I still single? Well, I think that at a subconscious level, you might be choosing to be single out of some deep seated insecurity or past trauma. And five, risk check, the day just. Okay, moving on to business and career related questions. What got you into making men's fashion and lifestyle videos in the first place? I think the first one I started watching in the early 2010s was Alpha M. I still watch Aaron to this day. So funny you mentioned Aaron. Aaron is a friend of mine. I've known him for probably seven years now. And he's the guy who got me on YouTube. So when I started, I was just blogging at themodestman.com and I emailed Aaron's like info at AaronMarino.com or something like that one day and just said, Hey, like I'm a blogger. I like your channel. I just wanted to talk and emailed me right back. We ended up talking on the phone that day for like an hour. And he said that I had to start a YouTube channel. Video is the future. And I really didn't want to I had a lot of resistance to it because video is hard compared to blogging. But I did and you know, I'm glad I did because now the channel is a huge part of what I do. So yeah, you can thank Alpha M for the modest man. Tips for someone starting a fashion Instagram. Don't. No, I'm just kidding. But but really think about it like what are your goals? Do you want to make money? Do you want just fame or followers? Or are you just doing it for fun? If you want to make money, honestly, don't think Instagram is the best place to do it. Now, if you like Instagram and you just want to do it for fun and get followers, go all in on video. Don't even bother posting static images on Instagram right now. Ideally, you could make content that is easily syndicated across the various short video platforms like IG Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, etc. But really think about why you're doing it. Content creation is a long term play. You're not going to make any money for a while and it's a grind. I don't think people realize how much time it takes to build an audience that you can actually make a living off of. And remember that when you build a following on social media, you don't own that audience. Instagram owns that audience. So if you really want to build a more sustainable business, I would have a website and an email list too. Hey, Brock, I'm 23 years old. I'm having trouble deciding what to do in my life, any tips or advice. Okay, you're 23. Don't chase money. It's easy to waste your 20s chasing money, working in jobs you hate, and making overly practical decisions. Now, of course, if you're in debt, pay it off. But if you have even an inkling about what you might be passionate about or what you might want to spend your time on, go pursue it. And if you get bored or lose interest or get interested in something else, that's fine. Change what you're doing. But if you do enjoy doing something, you're going to have the stamina to do it for longer than other people and you'll get better at it than other people. Once you're really good at something, the money will find you. What interests or skills make you respect someone more if they are a master at it? Honestly, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, manners, reading the room, knowing how people might react to what you say, understanding how people are reacting and feeling about what other people are saying. This is a soft skill that you can use in any industry and it's so underrated. I mean, just look at the comments section on anything on the internet. People lack emotional intelligence, especially these days when they can hide behind internet anonymity. I feel like we're kind of losing the ability to treat each other with respect, even strangers. And that's affecting how we interact in real life too. One great classic book about this is How to Win Friends and Influence People. If you haven't read it, it's a great read, highly recommended. Speaking of which, are there any books you would recommend on the topic of personal development? Yeah, some of my other favorites are The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. That kind of got me started on the whole online making money passive income thing. Another book is called 4000 Weeks, Time Management for Mortals. It's a great book on sort of finding peace with how you spend your time and figuring out how you want to prioritize your time. Similar book is called Essentialism and again, it's about learning how to focus and spend your time doing things that are meaningful in the long term. And finally, slightly weird, but there's a book called The Easy Way to Control Alcohol. And even if you don't have like a problem with drinking, if you just want to sort of examine your relationship with alcohol, I think that this is a great book. It really made me think about the role of alcohol in my life. Okay, Angelo says, any non-career advice for young adults who just graduated? Yeah, your 20s are a special time and they're very easy to waste. They're gonna fly by. You're gonna be in your 30s one day and you're gonna look back at your 20s and kind of wonder if you spent that time correctly. So whatever practical pressure you're under from your family to like get a job or something, ignore it. Whatever crazy ideas you have, do them. So if you've thought about living abroad, go. If you want to see if you can make money online and become a digital nomad, do it. If you want to move to Thailand and do martial arts full-time instead of getting a job, do it. And ideally, you document your journey online so you can start building an audience and making money. Life is long enough to master many different things. You can work on something for six or seven years and then change courses. It's long enough to make tons of money even if you don't start right now. So yeah, whatever crazy ideas you have in your 20s, go do them. Do not waste your 20s working in a job that you hate. Okay, and finally, what's the most important lesson you've learned throughout your career? Most successful people are able to do one thing, usually something that's kind of boring and mundane, over and over and over until they create this flywheel of success. Most people who aren't successful jump from one thing to the next. They never do anything for long enough to get that traction. They're not willing to have that grinding it out, teeth cutting period of life. For me, this grind was writing blog posts and making YouTube videos. I've written thousands, you know, of blog posts and articles and YouTube scripts and I've produced hundreds of YouTube videos. I got good at doing these things and I published enough content that now I've built a size of audience that I can build a business around. If you're in sales, the grind might be just making enough phone calls. If you're an artist, it's finishing hundreds of works. Same goes for music. You have to finish songs and release them. Even in science and engineering and medicine, I guarantee all the most successful surgeons have one thing in common. They've done a ton of surgeries, probably the same surgery over and over and over. So success is really more about endurance than anything else. It's definitely not about intelligence. It's about persistence. It's often pretty monotonous, but if you can outlast other people, you'll probably find success. And that's why it's important to find something that you kind of enjoy doing or at least that you don't dread doing because you're going to have to do it for a long time. And that's my career advice for you. So we've reached the end of the video. I appreciate you guys submitting all these questions. If I didn't get to your question, I'll try to get to it in the next Q&A, which at this rate, it's going to be like probably in like three years when I hit 500,000 subscribers maybe. I appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you so much for watching my videos and subscribing and commenting. And if you have any other questions for me, leave them down in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " In the world of men's style, fit is subjective. It's subject to trends. Some years, slim or even skinny fit is all the rage. And sometimes, like right now, looser fits are in style. But when it comes to men's suits, there are certain things that are objectively wrong. Pants that are three or four inches too long look bad on anybody. An oversized jacket that's too wide in the shoulders is gonna make you look like a kid playing dress up. And while it can be tricky to find a suit that fits really well, it's not rocket science. After you watch this video, you'll know how to nail all the different aspects of a suit, specifically 11 different areas that will make you look and feel like a million bucks. Okay, before we talk about how a suit should fit, we gotta answer the question, what is a suit? A suit is simply when your jacket and your pants are the same color and they're made from the same fabric. So that's what we're talking about today, but keep in mind that the proper fit for a suit jacket or suit pants is the same for like a sport coat, blazers, or odd trousers. So you can use what you learn in this video for your suits, but also your business casual getups. You might be asking, does suit fit really matter? It does because the thing is an ill fitting suit is actually one of the least flattering things a guy can wear. Doesn't matter how expensive it was, or what color it is, or what kind of fabric it's made from, it's not gonna do you any favors if it doesn't fit. It's gonna make you look careless and sloppy. I see this all the time at weddings, especially with like rental tuxedos and suits. They just look so bad, but a properly fitted suit looks good on anybody, regardless of your age, or your height, or your weight, or anything else. It's one of the most powerful garments that a guy can wear if you wanna be taken seriously, or if you wanna show respect for a formal event, or if you just wanna look incredibly handsome. So for me, given the choice between a $3,000 luxury suit that's from some designer that doesn't fit well, versus a $300 suit that's made from polyester but fits perfectly, I'll take that $300 suit every time. So let's talk about a suit fit, and remember, I'm showing you how I like suits to fit. Certain little details like the length of your pants and the cut of your jacket might depend on your own personal preferences. But this guide is gonna work for 99% of them. Let's start at the top of the suit with the collar. There shouldn't be any gap between your jacket collar and your shirt collar. Your jacket collar should sit right up against your shirt collar even when you're sitting down. If there is a gap, this means that your jacket collar might be a little bit too big, and this can be fixed by an experienced tailor. It might also be caused by some other more complicated problem. So if you're buying a suit off the rack, make sure that the collar fits properly and that there's no gap. Moving down to the shoulders, make sure that there aren't any divots on top of, or on the sides of your shoulders below the shoulder seam. The shoulders of your suit should have an even slope all the way down to where they connect to your sleeve. If they don't, it could mean that the shoulders are too wide. Now, some people have one shoulder that's significantly lower than the other, and if that's the case, you might wanna consider going custom. But regardless, the shoulder of your jacket should end where your actual shoulder ends. So that seam should sit right on top of your shoulder bone. You shouldn't see any divots or puddling at the top of the arm. To test shoulder fit, you can use the wall bump test where you just kind of lean against the wall. And if you feel the shoulder pads of your jacket hit the wall before your actual shoulder and arm, it's too wide. On the other hand, if your arm hits the wall first, it might mean that the shoulders are too narrow on your jacket, and this is gonna result in divots right below that seam. Plus, if the shoulders are too narrow, it's not gonna be comfortable. You're gonna kind of feel it when you flex. It's crucial to make sure that the shoulders fit well when you buy a suit jacket or a sport coat because this cannot be fixed at the tailor. Similarly, on the back of your jacket, if you see any horizontal stripes or you feel any pulling, when you kind of do this with your arms, it means that the top of the back is probably too tight. There's not enough material there, and that can't be fixed at the tailor either. Okay, moving down, let's talk about the arm hole. You want the arm hole to be as high as possible without feeling tight or restrictive. Counter-intuitively, a higher and smaller arm hole actually allows for easier movement. If you button your jacket and you lift your arms up and the jacket immediately starts raising up with your arms, the arm hole is probably too big and too low. Unfortunately, many off the rack suits, especially here in the U.S., have very large and low arm holes because they're meant to fit as many men as possible. Again, this can't really be fixed at the tailor. If you do have problems with arm holes off the rack, try going custom, but don't go overboard. If you feel the kind of seam and the fabric up in your armpit and it feels a little restrictive, it's probably a little too small. Okay, let's move on to the sleeves. You shouldn't see any big diagonal wrinkles on the sleeve. If you see this kind of twisting on the sleeve, it means that the pitch is off. Basically, this means that the construction of the jacket doesn't really line up with your posture. Everybody's different. Some people, when they put their arms down by their sides, their arms hang forward a little bit. Some people, their arms hang straight down. Some people turn inward. Some people turn outwards. And if the jacket sleeves don't match that angle, that pitch of your actual arms, you're gonna have that twisting and you're gonna see those wrinkles. Now, sleeve pitch can be corrected by a very skilled tailor, but it's gonna be expensive. So if you're buying a jacket, try to make sure that you don't see too many wrinkles on the sleeve. You also don't want your sleeves to be too baggy. Now, they can be too tight, but this usually isn't the case unless you have like a bodybuilder's build. If you can see the outline of your bicep, sleeve is too tight. Most guys are wearing jackets with sleeves that are too baggy. And you can get this fixed at the tailor. It's pretty easy to get a sleeve taken in. In terms of length, your jacket sleeve should be short enough that they show a little bit of shirt cuff. How much cuff you show is sort of up to you, but anything from just a little sliver to about a quarter inch will work for most guys. It's pretty easy to get your sleeves shortened at the tailor, but keep in mind if they have functioning buttonholes, you'll be limited as to how much you can shorten them without having to remove the buttons. Okay, let's look at the torso. Now, when I button a suit jacket, I like to feel just a little bit of compression, a little light squeeze around my midsection. You don't want a pronounced X-shaped wrinkle right on the front of your torso. That means that your suit jacket is probably too tight, but some subtle pulling a subtle X shape is really not that big of a deal. Another sign that your jacket might be too tight is if the lapels are popping out, creating a space between each lapel and your chest. Now, on the other hand, many guys are wearing suit jackets that are just too roomy. So if you see a lot of loose fabric or vertical wrinkles on the front of your chest or torso, or you feel like your jacket is just kind of hanging there in space away from your body, probably too big. The fix is easy, you simply have the waist taken in. Okay, let's talk about jacket length. The traditional rule is that a suit jacket should be long enough to cover your butt, but it shouldn't be much longer than that. One easy way to test the length of your suit jacket is to do the cup test. So you let your hands hang down by your side, and you see if you can cup your fingers around the bottom hem of your jacket. The jacket should end sort of where you naturally cup your fingers. If you can't reach the bottom of your jacket, it's definitely too long. Keep in mind, it's totally fine to wear slightly shorter jackets. A lot of my jackets are a little bit shorter. They don't quite reach the bottom of my butt. I can very easily cup them, and I kind of like the look. I think it works for my build. But if you're trying a suit on in the store, the cup test is a good place to start. Let's move on to the pants. Suit pants, like all pants, should stay up without a belt. Speaking of belts, why not just ditch the belt? I actually prefer side tabs or even suspenders for my suit pants. And if you do wear suspenders, you can actually go with a slightly looser waist because the suspenders are gonna hold your pants up. This is a great option for bigger guys. If your pants are too loose around the waist, that's an extremely easy fix at any decent tailor. Moving on to pants rise, this determines where the pants actually sit on your waist. Pants rise refers to the distance from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the crotch. A shorter distance results in lower rise pants and a longer distance results in higher rise or high-waisted pants. Now, unless you have a very short torso and very long legs, I would avoid low rise suit pants. Pursuits, a mid or even a higher rise is gonna look better on most guys. And this might feel a little strange if you're used to wearing low rise jeans, for example, that sit down on your hips and you put on a pair of higher-waisted suit trousers, they're gonna sit up closer to your belly button. It's actually very comfortable and a very flattering look. It kind of raises your perceived waistline and elongates your legs. So if you haven't tried higher rise suit pants, I recommend giving it a shot. Now, around the seat and the hips, you wanna avoid the saggy diaper butt look. You've probably seen this before, guys wearing suit pants that kind of sag a little bit in the back. Now, I'm not saying your pants should be so tight that they're uncomfortable, but they should sit relatively close to your hips and butt. On the other hand, if you don't skip leg day, you might find that some pants are a little too tight in the seat and the butt and that can't be fixed at the tailor. So, buy pants that are comfortable at the hips and the crotch and the seat and then you can always have them taken in a little bit. Now, through the leg, you know your pants are too tight if your front pockets are flaring out. If you find that that's often the case, you might wanna try pleated pants. These add a little bit of extra room flexibility around the hips. Pleats are a great choice for guys who are carrying around a little bit of extra weight in the midsection or if you just like to squat a lot. But if you're a smaller or slimmer guy, don't rule out pleats. A lot of my suit trousers have a single pleat in front and I actually really like the look and I find them to be really comfortable. Your pants should have a gentle taper from your thigh down to the leg opening around your ankle. They shouldn't hug your thighs or knees or calves. You shouldn't see any wrinkling around the knee, but they should follow the shape of your leg, which means they're gonna have a little bit of taper. And finally, let's discuss pants length. Now, if you've researched this or if you've ever bought a suit, you've probably heard the term pants break. Break refers to how long your pants are and how much of your pants sit on top of your shoe. For 99% of guys, 99% of the time, you're gonna wanna have slight break, which is often called partial break or quarter break. This means that your pants fold just a tiny bit on top of your shoe. You can also opt for the no break look, which is where your pants just barely kiss the tops of your shoes. And I actually really like this look. I think it's great, especially for shorter guys. But if you go with no break, you wanna make sure that your pants are pretty slim and have plenty of taper below the knee. Now, if you go any shorter than no break, you're gonna end up with a cropped look. It's not great for formal wear. If you go much longer, you're gonna end up with full break. This is a bit more conservative and traditional and it's not a great look for most guys unless you're really going for that old school look. If you do opt for more break, like a full break, make sure that your pants aren't super tapered. You're gonna want more of a straight cut. In general, more taper looks good with less break. Wider leg openings look good with more break. When in doubt, slim tapered suit pants with partial break is gonna work for you. And that's it. That's how a suit should fit. If you follow these guidelines, your suits are gonna look good now and they're gonna look good 10 and 20 years from now. Now, depending on your build, you might have to go custom to get a suit that really fits perfectly. But it can be incredible how well a skilled tailor can dial in the fit of an off-the-rack suit, assuming that it fits in those key areas like the shoulders. And remember, you can spend an entire lifetime tweaking the fit of your suits, trying to get them so close to perfect, but there is a point of diminishing returns. For the average guy who just wants to look sharp, doesn't wanna spend a million dollars or a whole lot of time, the advice that I gave you in this video is gonna get you there. And I'll just say that if you haven't gone to a tailor, if you don't have a tailor that you can trust, that's okay. You can kinda get away with it with casual quilting, but with suits, you really should invest in alterations. Unless you're buying custom suits, a tailor is going to be worth every penny. Even with my custom suits, I still get them tailored most of the time. And if you have any questions for me, let me know in the comment section. Thank you as always for watching, and until next time, stay stylish."

        "transcript": " There's nothing wrong with getting older. With age comes experience and wisdom and maybe even a bit more self-confidence. But of course, as you get older, you start to look older. And for most guys, these signs of aging usually show up first in our skin and our hair. Even if you're loving your 30s or your 40s or 50s or beyond, you might look older than you actually feel. Fortunately, there are some easy style and grooming hacks that you can use to shave a few years off of your appearance. So in this video, I'm gonna teach you a few things that you can do to look younger and age gracefully. I wanna thank today's video sponsor, Just For Men. Just For Men products have been used by millions of men over the past 30 years. They're easy to use, they're affordable, and they give you subtle, natural results. And that brings me to the first and most powerful way that a guy can look younger, reduce your gray hair. Now, there's nothing wrong with the salt and pepper look if you're digging the silver fox aesthetic, lean into it. But if you want to keep your color for a little while longer, I recommend reducing grays in one of two ways. If you want instant reduction, you can use Just For Men easy comb-in color. You can do this at home and it takes about 10 minutes. I actually did this a few weeks ago. It was surprisingly easy. The results were really subtle and very natural looking. Here is my wife's reaction after I dyed my hair. Wow. Oh, it's so natural. That's subtle. It's like you just look younger. If you're curious, I made a whole video about that process and I'll link to it down below, so definitely go check that out. But in my opinion, easy comb-in color is the easiest, most affordable, and least risky way to experiment with adding some color to your hair and reducing grays at home by yourself. It costs like $10, it takes 10 minutes, and the results last up to eight weeks until the grays grow back. But if you want an even easier method, the second method is by using Just For Men Control GX. This method is actually even easier because it's basically just a shampoo. You use it just like your normal shampoo and it gradually reduces grays all over your head. You literally just use it like any other shampoo or shampoo, conditioner, combo, and you can stop once you're happy with the results. I've been using Control GX for a few weeks now and it's really interesting. You can really see that kind of subtle reduction of grays over time. You don't have to go to a salon, you don't have to change your grooming routine. You literally just swap out your normal shampoo for Control GX. Now, if you're interested in trying this or if you wanna try easy comb-in color for instant reduction, head on over to JustForMen.com and use their virtual shade finder to figure out which shade is best for your hair. I will link to the virtual shade finder down below in the description. It's actually really fun to use. You can use your webcam or upload a photo and you can see what you'll look like if you use JustForMen. Once you find your shade, you can buy JustForMen products at a local retailer or you can buy it online. At the very least, you should definitely go play with the virtual shade finder because it's kind of fun to see what you would look like if you reduced some of your grays. Again, links to all that down below in the description and thanks again to JustForMen for supporting the channel by sponsoring this video. Okay, tip number two to look younger is to stay clean shaven. Facial hair is another easy way to control how old you look. A clean shave almost always makes a man look younger. I remember in high school, there was this one kid who basically had a full beard by like junior year and he looked way older than everybody else and I was always super jealous. To be honest, I'm still kind of them. But as I got older, I realized that the clean shaven look isn't necessarily a bad thing. It actually makes you look a lot younger, especially as you start to get that salt and pepper in your beard. Just look at these two photos of Don Cheadle taken less than two years apart. He looks way younger without facial hair. Same thing goes for Daniel Craig, even though he doesn't have as many grays in his beard. So if you've had facial hair for a long time and you wanna look a bit younger, try shaving it off, you might be surprised. Tip number three is to wear blue, not gray. Now this works for any outfit, but it's especially true with formal wear like suits. Just like reducing gray hair will make you look younger. Reducing gray in your outfit and replacing it with more youthful colors like blue will shave a few years off of your appearance. So when you're suiting up opt for navy or a medium blue or even a lighter blue over gray or charcoal or black, if you wanna get away from navy, you can also try brown or tan. And if you wanna branch out a bit, you can try dark green or burgundy. And these are gray colors for older guys who wanna add a bit more youthful energy to their formal getups. Tip number four is to wear fitted clothing. Now if you're an older guy who's trying to dress well, you might be tempted to wear what the kids are wearing. And right now in 2022, that means more relaxed, looser fits. But there's a big difference between intentionally baggy clothes and the old man frumpy look. And I think it's pretty difficult for older guys to pull off the looser fit that's kind of on trend right now, but might not be that cool in a few years without drifting into that old guy frumpy territory. On top of that, when older guys wear super trendy outfits, in my opinion, it sort of accentuates their age rather than masking it. Like if you're 50 years old and you look like you just walked out of an H&M dressing room, it's gonna be very obvious that you're trying to dress younger. Now if trendy clothing makes you happy, you should definitely wear what you like regardless of your age. But just like when Robert Downey Jr. wears Jordans with his suits, there's going to be this obvious visual mismatch between your age and your style. Plus regardless what kind of shape you're in, looser clothes don't enhance your physique. Gently fitted clothing on the other hand, will enhance your physique and that'll make you look a bit younger. Now if your clothes don't fit properly, if they have a little bit too much room, I highly recommend taking them to the tailor and getting them altered for a better fit. It's always cheaper than buying new clothes and it's money well spent. Tip number five is to wear sneakers. Now I'm not talking about due balances, I'm not talking about your Brooks running shoes. I'm talking about minimal sneakers made from leather or suede in neutral colors like white, off-white, brown, gray and black. This type of sneaker goes with almost any casual or smart casual outfit. It can be worn all year round and it adds a bit of youthful energy to your look because it's a sneaker. But it's way more mature than like Stan Smith's or Jordans or really anything with a logo on it. Of all the shoe styles that I've tried, this style, the minimal leather and suede sneaker has gotten by far the most wear. And that hasn't changed as I've gotten older. This style ages really well. So if you don't have this type of minimal sneaker in your closet, I highly recommend grabbing a pair or two. And this is especially true for older guys who wanna look a bit younger but in a tasteful way. The next tip is to ditch your glasses. Now almost everybody will need some sort of vision correction at some point in life, usually later. Many people choose glasses because they're convenient and it's a one time purchase. I wear glasses sometimes and to be honest, I don't mind the way they look, but if you wanna look younger, contacts are hands down the better choice. The reason being our vision deteriorates with age and so glasses are a subtle sign of being older. They sort of send a subconscious message to people that says I need these glasses to look better because my eyes don't work as well as they used to when I was younger. Now I keep a couple of pairs of glasses for like watching movies or driving at night, but if I ever get to the point where I have to wear them all the time, I'm definitely gonna go with contacts or laser eye surgery. And that'll help keep that youthful pep in my step. And finally, my last tip is to get more sleep. Everybody knows that sleep is very important, but most men still don't get enough of it. And I'm in that category by the way, you know, it's just tough, like especially if you have young kids or infants at home and it's a manning job. For me between exercise and family and work, I almost never get eight hours. But I do make an effort and not just because of the health benefits that are well documented at this point and also feeling well rested is just nice. It helps you be more productive at work and helps me be a more pleasant person to be around. But when you're well rested, you actually look a lot better. Like it reduces those signs of fatigue in your face, especially around your eyes. And that definitely makes you look younger. And again, I'm no expert here. You can see it in my face, but I do track my sleep with an aura ring. And if I get a bad sleep score, you know, I try to take a nap later in the day or I try to go to bed a little earlier the next night. The old saying, what gets measured gets managed is true. And when you're acutely aware of just how little sleep you're getting, you will make an effort to get more of it. So if you're feeling and looking tired, I recommend tracking your sleep with an aura ring or a Fitbit or an app on your phone. And if you can get a couple of more hours, whether it's at night or taking a nap, I think that you'll start to see it in your face. You're just gonna look and feel a bit younger. And that's it. Those are some things that you can start doing today to look younger and to age gracefully. I wanna thank Just For Men again for sponsoring this video and for supporting the channel. I've had a really great experience with both Easy Comin' Color and Control GX Shampoo. I've used these products in the comfort of my own home and I've been really happy with how subtle and natural the results are. So if you're interested in reducing some of your grays, I definitely recommend checking them out. Links down in the description.

        "transcript": " Alright, it's been a while since my last watch collection video and definitely time for an update. I've actually added many new watches to the lineup because I bought a website called theslenderist.com and so I'm getting a lot of new watch samples to do reviews and other content for that site. And if the Slenderist sounds familiar, that's because the original founder, Alessandro, had a YouTube channel under the same name. He changed the name of that channel to Timed Square and he still uploads videos about watches, so he's a really cool guy and you should definitely check that out if you're into watches. Right now, theslenderist.com is just a website. I may start a YouTube channel later, but currently publishing a lot of really high quality reviews with great photos and other buying guides. So definitely go check out theslenderist.com. But anyway, in this video, I'm going to show you my current watch collection. These are the watches that I actually wear on a somewhat regular basis, so it's not every watch that I own. We're going to start with the newest watches in my collection, but before we get into it, I want to thank today's sponsor, Deweyr. Deweyr is a Canada-based performance apparel brand for men and women. They make incredibly comfortable pants, shorts, and shirts. And what I like about Deweyr is they specialize in comfort, but they don't sacrifice style. So their fabrics are five times stretchier than traditional cotton or denim, but they don't look like techy fabrics. You know, they're not shiny and they don't make those swishy sounds when you walk around. Deweyr's fabrics are breathable. They'll adapt to different temperatures, they're lightweight and they're soft. And some of them are made from sustainable materials like wood chips and recycled plastic bottles. One of my favorite Deweyr pieces is the No Sweat Pant. I recently wore these on a cross-country trip that involved 12 hours of flying and driving and a five-month-old baby. And I have to say, they performed admirably. The cool max and tensile fibers kept me cool on the plane. And the pants dried off like immediately after we got caught in the rain in the parking lot. Also, the signature gusset and reinforced seams make these pants great for like hiking or biking or anything else that would cause a lot of wear and tear on the seat area of regular pants. For a more business-casual appropriate look, I tried Deweyr's Smart Stretch Pant. These slim tapered pants are designed for the office, but you could definitely wear them with casual shirts and even sneakers. I love that these Smart Stretch Pants have enough room in like the hips and the thighs, but still plenty of taper down to the ankle. The fabric is stretchy and comfy, but it's not shiny. If you work in a business-casual office, you should definitely consider picking these up. You can check out these pants along with everything else that Deweyr makes using the links down below in the description. And if you do buy something, use the code MODESTMAN for 15% off your order. Thanks for one more time to Deweyr for sponsoring this video and be sure to use the code MODESTMAN for 15% off your order. Okay, let's talk watches. Starting with the most recent acquisition, we have the Laurier Falcon 2. Now, there are so many micro brands out there right now, and it can be hard to kind of sort through all of them and figure out which ones are actually worth your money. Laurier is one of those gems. The Falcon is a retro-sized steel watch with an angular sort of 80s style bracelet. It kind of reminds me of the Rolex Oyster Quartz bracelet. It's a really simple watch without any unnecessary details. You know, there's no see-through case back here. The dial has this diamond pattern texture, which adds just enough visual interest to the watch because otherwise it's a pretty minimal watch. It's an automatic, which is nice, and it's sized perfectly for my 6.25 inch wrists. I think this is one of the best micro brand watches you can get for under $500 right now. And for what it's worth, I have hung out with Lorenzo, the co-founder of Laurier, and he's a cool guy. So it's always good to know that there are good people behind a brand. Next up, we have the Seiko Pursage SRP827J1. I've always admired Seiko's cocktail time watches from their Pursage collection, but for me, the size of these watches has always been a little too big, especially for a dress watch. So I was excited to discover their unisex line, which have 34 millimeter dials, which is a much better size for dress watches, even by modern day standards. This watch is powered by Seiko's 4R35 automatic movement. It has a date window at three o'clock. It's hacking. It can be hand wound. It has a stainless steel case, a box shaped hardlex crystal over the dial and a see-through case back. This watch actually comes on a steel bracelet with a deployment clasp. It's actually a really nice bracelet. It's very comfortable, but I couldn't get it to fit my wrist. It was either too tight or too loose, depending on how many links I removed. So I ended up putting it on a leather strap, which I think looks really good for a dress watch. The dial on this watch is spectacular. It looks really cool in different lighting and you can kind of turn it and see how the light plays on the dial. And honestly, even though this is kind of a dressy watch, I think you can wear it casually too. Next up, we have for what me was a long time Grail, the Rolex Explorer 114270. This is a late model 114270. So that means it's one of the last of the second version of the modern 36 millimeter explorers before they released it last year. I haven't tried the new 36 millimeter explorers yet. It looks like all the little tweaks they made are really nice. So maybe one day I'll swap this one out for a new one. But either way, this is a great watch. Really any 36 millimeter explorer is an awesome watch. It could truly be a one watch collection. And while I don't really have any sentimental value attached to this watch, it does get more wear than anything else in my collection right now. I certainly haven't been any less enamored with this watch than I was when I first unboxed it. I'm sure my taste will change over time, but right now still loving this one. Next up, we have the Casio F84W. I've had this watch for a few years now and I still wear it like sometimes at the gym or from going for a bike ride or doing anything else where I think my watch might get destroyed. It's a $20 watch. You know, I don't care what happens to it. It's okay if it gets stolen or broken. It's also so low profile. It feels more like you're wearing a bracelet than a watch. I also love that this watch is just slightly different than the ever popular F91W. That's a cool watch too, but everyone has it. So the 84W, which is the Japanese domestic model, is just a little more unique. The colors are a little different. It's actually a bit lower profile and I think the strap is more comfortable. Next up, we have this Vintage Rolex Datejust. Without a doubt, this is the most special watch in my collection. It has a taupe dial, which is sort of like a warm gray in certain lighting like bright light. It looks silver and then in dimmer lighting, it almost has like a tan look. And the dial has white lettering instead of black, which makes it a bit more unique than a standard silver dial Datejust. It also has the quick set date, which is convenient because I'll usually go a few weeks without wearing this watch. I got this watch right before I got married, so I wore it at my wedding. And so it just has a lot of memories built in. I wore this watch when my daughter was born. So if I could only keep one watch from my collection, it would hand down be the Datejust. It's also really comfortable that janky kind of beat up jubilee bracelet is very comfy. And I know this watch is kind of in rough shape. I definitely need to get it to the Rolex spa sometime soon. I want to get it cleaned up and refreshed, maybe get the bracelet tightened up or just replaced. But even in its current state, I love wearing this watch. I even wear it with casual outfits like shorts and a t-shirt. And it's my go-to watch when I do dress up or like put a suit on for a wedding. And finally, another watch that holds a special place in my heart, the Seiko SKX-013. This was my first mechanical watch, first automatic. And it's still one of the best dive watches for guys with slender wrists, in my opinion. Now, this one was discontinued a few years back. You can still find it pre-owned on places like eBay or Reddit. And you can also find a brand new SKX-013's on the gray market, but it's going to cost you. I think back when I got this, it was like less than $400 from Amazon. My SKX came on a Jubilee bracelet, which was comfortable, but kind of janky. I always thought it would look better on an oyster just because it's, you know, it's kind of a squat, chunky little dive watch. I got this oyster bracelet from Strapcode. It was made specifically for the 013, so it fits perfectly. For a long time, I wore this watch every day. I was just so obsessed with it. And I still really like it, although it doesn't get as much wear these days. I do still wear this watch, especially if I'm going on vacation, like to the beach. If I'm going to go swimming in the ocean or snorkeling, this is a great watch for that. And this watch also has some nice memories. I wore on my honeymoon and a couple of other really fun vacations. So it's got some sentimental value. And for that reason alone, it's staying in my collection. And that's it. I'm sure this collection will continue to evolve over time and hopefully be refined. You know, I really don't want to own more than like four or five watches, but I want to love every single one. I've had my eye on like the Cartier Santos. I've been eyeing a Grand Seiko. One day, maybe I'll swap this Explorer out for the new one. But I am very happy with the current lineup. I love all these watches and I would be more than happy with just the Explorer and the day trust.
